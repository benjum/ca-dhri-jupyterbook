Political Chattery to be Inaugurated. 


In an editorial discussing Senator 
Morgan's position on the race question, 
the San Francisco Call, an administra¬ 
tion paper, of April 7, comments in 
part as follows: 

* * * As no one is inclined to bat¬ 
tle for the rights of a people who will 
not themselves defend those rights, it 
is highly improbable that any consid¬ 
erable number of the Northern people 
will be found ready to stand by the 
constitution and insist that all of its 
guarantees shall be enjoyed by those 
to whom they were given. Morgan’s 
citation of the form that nullification 
took in Mississippi is especially sug¬ 
gestive. There is some craftiness in 
the Maryland and South Carolina laws, 
and searching argument and analysis 
are required to prove them obnoxious 
to the constitution. But it is not so 
with the law of Mississippi. It is clear¬ 
ly disfranchisement of living negroes 
because their dead grandfathers were 
slaves. No wonder the senator regards 
Northern indifference to that flagrant 
provision as a “distinct victory” over 
the constitution, though he hides it 
under the euphemism of “white suf¬ 
frage.” 

NEGRO SUFFRAGE DOOMED. 

We think that we are justified in con¬ 
cluding that negro suffrage is doomed, 
and that the constitution of the United 
States is powerless to secure it against 
the determined opposition of any con¬ 
siderable number of people. The whole 
country on a rising vote stands for 


LOS ANGELES, CAL., MAY, 1901. 


white suffrage only, and on a call for 
the negative no one rises, for the ti&ie 
to do bo was when the Congressional 
apportionment passed the last Congress. 
The South will he permitted to disfran¬ 
chise the negro and yet retain over fifty 
congressman and as many votes in the 
electoral college, by still counting him 
for purposes of apportionment and rep¬ 
resentation. And this, although both 
are directly and distinctly forbidden by 
the Federal constitution! 

THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT 
DEAD. 

A WHITE MAN’S GOVERNMENT. 

This condition opens up a wide field 
not for speculation,but for reflection as 
to the future status of Porto Rico, Ha¬ 
waii and the Philippines. We are, by 
the active agency of the South and the 
passive North, establishing the prin¬ 
ciple that this is a white man’s gov¬ 
ernment. We are going back to the 
Dred Scott decision and accepting that 
part of its dicta as a repeal of the fif¬ 
teenth amendment. 

THE COLOR OF THE SKIN TO BE 
THE TEST OF CITIZENSHIP. 

All this is in line with what we be¬ 
lieve is the present mind and will be 
the future inflexible policy of the peo¬ 
ple as to all the islands. Their black 
and yellow'millions will never be ad¬ 
mitted to equal citizenship, nor their 
territory to statehood in this republic. 

All told, they number about 16,000,- 
000, and the decree may be regarded as 
written that they are to be permently 
excluded. Much trouble is avoided by 
present frankness. The reported in¬ 
ducement held out for pacification of 
the Filipinos, that they are to have 
statehool and citizenship, is a lure and 
delusion. They will never have either. 
If they choose to take the oath with 
that understanding there is no objec¬ 
tion, but to take it with the promise of 
satehood is a process of sowing drag¬ 
on’s teeth. 


No. 20. 


FORCE TO BE THE CORNERSTONE 
OF THE REPUBLIC—PO¬ 
LITICAL CHATTELRY. 

With the principle of exclusive white 
government established, we will find 
ourselves with 13,000,000 of domestic 
negroes and 16,000,000 of islanders on 
our hands to be governed, without sub¬ 
stantial voice in that g6vernment. That 
will be 30,000,000 of people, denied in¬ 
dependence, held in political chattelry 
and deprived of the only means by 
which they can consent to government. 
Passive submission or open revolt is all 
that is left to them. 

Before we bind the islands irrevoca¬ 
bly it is well to give some thought to 
these considerations.

EX-PRESIDENT AGUINALDO AND 

GENERAL FUNSTON. 

Through the agency of traitors, Gen¬ 
eral Funston captured Aguinaldo. 
Americans of course hate traitors with 
intense hatred where they are em¬ 
ployed by other nations. Whatever 
place he may occupy in history, he 
will owe it to his connection with Ag¬ 
uinaldo. Aguinaldo will live as the 
representative of man and the defend¬ 
er of man’s God-given rights, and Gen¬ 
eral Funston as the representative of 
force. He is of course the hero of the 
hour, because heroism is cheap when 
getting dollars is the object of exist¬ 
ence. But when man gains the 
ascendancy over the dollar, when the 
dollar becomes the means and man 
the end, when Christianity supplants 
hypocrisy and religion takes the place 
of theology, when true merit becomes 
the only requisite for promotion and 
the monument builders of the future 
begin to erect shafts to the memory 
of the great men of our day, they may 
be able to rescue General Funston from 
oblivion by making him the pedestal of 
Aguinaldo’s monument. Pharaoh is 
dead, but Moses stil Heads the children 
of God to the Promised Land. Greece 
and Rome have long since slept amid 
the ruins of fallen empires, but Leon¬ 
idas at Thermopolae, and Horacisus at 
the bridge still hold unfurled the ban¬ 
ner of liberty.

THE LIBERATOR. 


The White Press of the Coun¬ 
try Having Made Mob 
Law Popular, 

Now Loath Their Friends the 
Lynchers. 


Getting Weary of Being Regarded by the 
World as the Mouth Piece of 
Savages. 


MOBOCRATIC NEGROES. 

The gleeful manner in which the 
white press of the country announces 
now and then that lawless negroes in 
certain lawless sections have imitated 
their mobocratic white neighbors by 
brutally murdering some defenseless 
negro charged with crime, is another 
proof that “misery loves company.” 
With what eagerness they grasp every 
opportunity to let the world know that 
they have succeeded in making some 
of the negroes as low and brutal as the 
white men, who go in droves to hang, 
butcher and burn at the stake defense¬ 
less negroes, who were never tried for 
the crime with which they were 
charged. They seem to be growing 
tired of the lonely, hellish monopoly 
of being members of the only race 
that take their wives and children out 
to see nude men slowly burned to 
death. They are anxious to say to the 
world: “The niggers are no better 
than we are; they lynch, too.” Becom¬ 
ing tired of being continually disgraced 
by the mob’s brutal acts, and being 
afraid to openly announce them, they 
are now trying to shift the responsibil¬ 
ity by turning the mobbing of the 
negroes over to the negroes. This, of 
course, would not prevent lawless 
whites from gratifying their brutal in¬ 
stincts so often displayed, but could 
be so arranged as to give the negroes 
all of the credit. To know that men 
have fallen lower in the scale of virtue 
by our teaching does not raise us in 
the estimation of virtuous people. 


GETTING ASHAMED OF THEIR 
ACTS 

A sinner cannot be saved until he is 
convinced that he is is a sinner and 
needs saving. When a lawless people 
become intelligent enough to, in part, 
see themselves as others see them; 
when they become ashamed and loath 
their crimes and seek to get rid of 
them, even by putting them upon the 
shoulders of others, there is hope for 
the redemption of that people. 

Now that the whites are anxious to 
give the negroes a part of the lynch¬ 
ing monopoly, it shows that they are 
becoming ashamed of their lynching 
distinction. It is a distinction that 
smells to heaven and damns to hell. It 
is a distinction that degrades; one 
that the negro does not desire and will 
not have. It is a distinction that no 
good people deserve and no brave peo¬ 
ple would wear. 


THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE NE¬ 
GRO RACE. 

Being one of this seemingly despised 
race, I often wonder in what condi¬ 
tion it will be in half a century. What 
it shall be and ought to be depends 
upon the young man and the young 
woman of today. 

If we put forth a vigorous and earn¬ 
est effort for the advancement of our 
race, we will not fail. How can we do 
it? I know of no better way than to 
cultivate our minds as well as our 
hands. Bearn to think and to plan for 
ourselves. Be determined to know 
something. Know a little of history, the 
host poetry, biography, the best of art, 
the facts in science and the thoughts 
of (lie best minus. 

Devote a few minutes each day to 
reading solid books, not mere stories, 
and by all means avoid trashy litera¬ 
ture. The best m style and sentiment 
is as cheap a? the poorest. Read the 
papers if you want to be well informed 
and know the cm rent events. Read the 
lives of the leading men of our race 
and profit by their success. 

Just as soon as we learn to think and 
pian for oiirsehp3, we will have more 
confidence and respect for ourselves. 
Then wo can demand the respecc of 
others. 

Jt is thought by some that we have 
no deep thinkers and care for nothing 


but things of a frivolous nature. They 
say the negroes are simply their imi¬ 
tators. If this be true, let us copy 
Lheir best qualities only. When they 
see that we are striving to better our 
condition they will lend us a helping 
hand. 

We must fight for ourselves. We do 
not need h words, but we do need to 
better our lives and to learn that the 
prosperity of the. negroes does depend 
on morality. Let us strive to be cul¬ 
tured men and women and have the 
respect of our fellow beings.

A STRANGE REVENGE. 

Some time ago several members of 
the Wesley M. E. church left, taking 
with them all of the money belonging 
to the benevolent societies of the 
church, amounting to several hundred 
dollars, which they refused to give up. 
When asked why they kept the money, 
which ithey knew did not belong to 
them, they replied that they did so to 
revenge the preacher, Rev. Donohoo. 
This is indeed strange, when it is 
known that the money was the prop¬ 
erty of hard-working old men and wo¬ 
men and that Rev. Donohoo was not even 
a member of the societies thus relieved 
of their cash. Now, as the parties tak¬ 
ing the money are all church members 
and Christians, or claim to be, their 
actions do not seem to be in accord with 
their professions. Now, brethren, “let 
your light so shine before men that they 
may see your good works and glorify 
your Father which is in heaven.” Tak¬ 
ing poor old hard-working people’s 
money without their consent may be 
“light” for some men, but itwill not 
glorify God.

Mr. Lee, the well known and popu¬ 
lar chiropodist and barber, has opened 
an office at 114 San Pedro street, and 
will devote his entire time to his pro¬

have been so satisfactory to his num¬ 
erous patients that the whole of his

Eloquent Tribute totbe Mem¬ 
ory of the Late Colonel 
Robt. G. Ingersoll, 

By the Pastor of the Third Congregational 
Church, Colored, of Washington, D. C. 


ADDRESS BY REV. DR. A. P. MIL- 
LER. 

“It is not at all strange nor surpris¬ 
ing that members of a race, long op¬ 
pressed in this country, and hampered 
on all sides by an unreasonable and 
unreasoning prejudice; members of a 
race long despised in church and state, 
should meet here tonight and speak in 
terms of loving remembrance of one 
whose mind was too pure and lofty to 
hate a single member of the human 
family and whose heart was large 
enough to embrace universal man¬ 
kind. 

“The late Colonel Robert G. Inger- 
soll, in his logical and philosophical 
way of looking at things, found it diffi¬ 
cult to reconcile human conduct, as he 
saw it, with high-sounding human 
creeds and theological dogmas. He 
could not see how a world like ours, 
so full of evil, selfishness, inequalities, 
miseries and racial prejudice could be 
the work of a loving, infinitely wise 
and all-powerful God. 

“This great fact that stands out so 
prominently in human history stag¬ 
gered his brain; so nature was his 
God, reason his guide, and love of hu¬ 
manity his creed. 

“And he was no hypocrite. He prac¬ 
ticed what he preached most eloquent¬ 
ly in his everyday life, in his model 
home as a devoted, faithful husband, a 
loving, tender father, and a member 
of human society. As a friend and 
citizen he was always loyal, sympa¬ 
thetic and true. 

‘He most assiduously devoted his life 
and magnificent physical, intellectual 
and moral endowments to the interests 
of others. He lived for others, and 
died unchanged. 

“He was an uncompromising lover 
of human rights and personal liberty, 
and as an advocate of these great fun¬ 


damental principles in civilization put 
to shame millions -of so-called Chris¬ 
tians who worship from Sunday to 
Sunday in our churches, all over this 
country, with their sky-piercing stee¬ 
ples. 

“He took no stock in American 
Christianity, or churchanity, for to him 
it was a system of hypocrisy, humbug- 
gery and sham. It lacked love of man, 
an honest attempt and purpose to live 
up to the Golden Rule, so loudly 
preached, but so little regarded and 
practiced in all human relations. 

“A dose of American churchanity is 
a terrible thing for any critical, analyt¬ 
ical, philosophical, and decent mind to 
swallow. 

“He could not understand a system 
of religion claiming to be based on 
love of God and man that would allow 
Christians in the holy city of Atlanta, 
Ga., one Sunday, to leave the temple 
of God, charter trains and run excur¬ 
sions to a small neighboring town to 
torture and burn alive a human being 
who had never been convicted of any 
crime. To him it was an outrage upon 
modern civilization, to say nothing 
about a civilization that wants to be 
regarded as Christian. Ingersoll spoke 
out against it. 

“ThePresident,who was touring near 
by, was too much Christian to wound 
the feelings and pride of his fellow 
citizens and Christian brethren by ut¬ 
tering a single word in protest. 

“In my opinion, the world would be 
infinitely better off if we had more men 
of the Ingersoll stamp. Unholy wars 
and fiendish lynchings would be very 
soon things of the past. 

“He was too much of a gentleman 
to wrong any living soul. The differ¬ 
ence between him and the average 
Christian, so-called, was this: without 
any church creed, in his life he gave 
us the essence of Christianity, while 
the churchman gives all creed, but 
.precious little real Christian living. 

“The priest and Levite were both 
orthodox members of the national 
church at Jerusalem, but the good 
Samaritan, whose heart was nearest 
humanity in its suffering, who had 
mercy on his brother in distress, did 
that which was most pleasing to God. 

“It is said that the Right Rev. Bish¬ 
op H. M. Turner of Atlanta, Ga., a few 
years ago, upon hearing that a certain 
eminent divine was coming to his city 


to lecture upon a subject that he de¬ 
sired to hear discussed, sent a note to 
him through the mail apprising him of 
his wishes, asking him to favor him 
with a ticket so that he would not be 
compelled to listen to him from the 
peanut gallery. But this Christian gen¬ 
tleman replied that he had no jurisdic¬ 
tion, that all such delicate matters were 
in the hands of a local committee. The 
good bishop did not hear the lecture. 

“Very soon thereafter Robert Inger¬ 
soll was announced to speak in the 
same theater upon ‘Liberty.’ The 
Bishop addressed a letter to him, 
couched in essentially the same words. 
The reply, characteristic of the man, 
came quickly, with a ticket admitting 
the venerable bishop to Mr. IngersolFs 
own private box. The bishop heard 
the lecture, but he was the black fly 
that spoiled the social ointment for 
that Christian community. 

“The Atlanta Constitution spoke out 
against this so-called outrage in un¬ 
measured tones, and in terms anything 
but complimentary to Colonel Ingersoll. 

‘Of these two men, if you were left 
in the cold, unfeeling world such as we 
live in, which would you choose as 
your brother man: this eminent divine 
with his wagon-load of D. D.’s, etc., 
or this plain, sympathetic lover of hu¬ 
manity, who denied to no man what 
he claimed for himself as his nature- 
given right, Robert G. Ingersoll, the 
Agnostic?” 


OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL NOT 
LAST. 

Good farming lands, in fact as fine 
as there is in the state, can be bought 
for from $300 to $500 per acre, but 
these opportunities cannot last. There 
are thousands of acres of land lying all 
around in close proximity of this city 
that can be gotten now at the prices 
named, but in a few more years they 
will be in the city limits, and then they 
will be worth twice or three times their 
present value. One acre of this land 
is worth twenty in Mississippi.

VALUABLE RECOGNITION. 

The great work that The Liberator is 
doing in the cause of good government 
and the elevation of the Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans is being substantially recognized 
by both our white and colored fellow 
citizens. One white gentleman sent his 
check for $5, with a request to “go on 
with the good work.” Another bought 
50 copies to send to friends. One white 
lady sent a check for $3.50 and a very 
encouraging letter, extracts from which 
we publish elsewhere. 

Through aid of Revs. J. E. Edwards 
and F. L. Donohoo, 200 copies were 
sold. Yearly subscribers have coma in 
with the cash in bunches. In handling 
public questions The Liberator has 
been broad, honest and candid, seek¬ 
ing only the common welfare of all.

among all classes who favor good gov¬

ernment and fair play. Colored men, 
we have yet lots of white friends who 
will come to us as soon as we prove 
ourselves worthy. 

-o- 

The following extract from a letter 
written to the editor of The Liberator 
concerning the debate in the Ebell club 
as to the advisability of admitting col¬ 
ored women’s clubs to the National 
Federation of Women’s Clubs is indeed 
encouraging, if not to say inspiring: 

“Indeed,while some felt that it would 
not be good policy, there was an ear¬ 
nestness and kindness shown for your 
people that would have done you good. 
I do not wonder that, at times, the sit¬ 
uation looks hopeless to you, but I do 
say to you: “Be of good cheer,” for 
your people slowly and painfully are 
coming out of the black cloud that 
once entirely enveloped them. They are 
not yet far enough away from the 
storm center, for they are battered 
and bruised and hurt unto death, but 
the day will come when they shall gain 
the open ground and find peace and 
space for full development, when the 
world will not only know, but feel and 
acknowledge that “a man’s a man for 
a’ that.” Remember always that there 
are many hearts in white bosoms that 
bleed over your great wrongs and burn 
with indignation over your humilia¬ 
tions.”

THE PRESIDENT’S VISIT. 

The President and his million dollar 
train will pay this city a visit on the 
8th. It is needless to say that he and 
his friends will receive a cordial greet¬ 
ing, such as only Californians can give. 
In an open carriage he will head the 
Fiesta parade and thus give all a 
chance to see him. This, of course, will 
he worth a day’s journey to us woolly 
Westerners. There is one thing we cer¬ 
tainly want to see and that is histrain. 
In his trip through Dixie he received 
a grand ovation, and, strange to say, 
the colored man and brother is not re¬ 
ported as being in evidence anywhere 
along the line. The colored brother 
seems to have been entirely overlooked. 
Even here the Sumner Marching club 
and the Crown City Marching club both 
seemed to have been left in the lurch 
in the make-up of the committees. We 
hope the boys will not become discour¬ 
aged as they will be needed to catch 
state dust next year. It is “yo’ meat,” 
boys.

DEAN'S DRUG STORE. 

We again call the attention of the 
colored people to the importance of 
patronizing only those firms or busi¬ 
ness houses that give employment to 
colored persons and advertise in col¬ 
ored papers. We were standing near 
Dean’s drug store, corner Spring and 
Second streets, the other'day, when we 
noticed two colored ladies go in and 
make a purchase. When they came out 
we expressed our pleasure in seeing 
them patronize the house. In 
reply they said: “Yes, Mr. 

Wyche works there, and we read 
The Liberator.” Now, if this plan 
of helping those who help us, by 
giving us an opportunity to earn dol¬ 
lars, hundreds of business men in this 
city would find it to their interest to 
employ some colored help. We have 
found by investigation that business 
men who advertise in colored papers 
and employ colored help will sell you 
just as cheap and give you more con¬ 
sideration for your trade than those 
who refuse. The man who will not 
give you an opportunity to make a 
living on account of your color will 
treat you unfairly in business for the 
same reason. To spend your money 
where it will do you the most good is 
to trade only with those who give your 
people a chance to earn some of it 
back. This policy, if rigidly Adhered 
to, will not only open hundreds of op¬ 
portunities for your sons and daugh¬ 
ters, but will materially aid in break¬ 
ing down the senseless color prejudice 
that is injuring both races in this coun¬ 
try. When you want drugs of any 
kinds call at Dean’s.

OF INTEREST TO COLORED MEM. 

In no state in the Union has the col¬ 
ored man a better opportunity to be¬ 
come self-supporting and independent 
than he has in this state. No section 
of this state offers him such large, 
quick and sure returns for his labor 
as the occupation of truck gardener in 
Southern California does. For the pro¬ 
duction of all kinds of vegetables the 
land in the vicinity of Los Angeles is 
the garden spot of the world. The 
soil is rich and is found in every vari¬ 
ety. The climate is so mild that straw¬ 
berries, peas, cabbage, potatoes and 


other tender plants are grown in the 
open fields during winter without dan¬ 
ger of frost. The products of the truck 
gardener find always a ready market 
at paying prices in Los Angeles and 
other Southern California towns. We 
know of no field that offers the col¬ 
ored man greater reward than that of 
truck gardening. Fine land can be 
rented for $2 per acre; 2 to 2 y 2 acres 
planted in vegetables will furnish a 
man steady work to produce and mar¬ 
ket his products. After the first six 
months an industrious gardener will 
have vegetables to sell every day in 
the year, with an ever-ready market— 
a market that is always expanding. 
Almost the whole of the truck garden¬ 
ing business is done by Chinamen, who 
are making fortunes every year, which 
they send back to China, and this to 
the injury of the business interests of 
this section. Then, too, the bad man¬ 
ner in which vegetables are handled by 
the Chinamen makes the introduction 
of intelligent and cleaner methods very 
desirable. 

This is an opportunity for colored 
men to make themselves independent, 
influential citizens, that should not pass 
idly by.

A MISTAKE. 

By flocking into the cities the colored 
people who come to California make a 
serious mistake. While the cities are 
crowded and have more men than jobs, 
there is plenty of room in the country 
and men who want to work find ready 
employment at good wages. Colored 
farmers who come here and flock into 
the cities are simply inviting idleness, 
poverty and crime into their homes. 
Nothing breeds crime and vice like 
idleness and overcrowded homes. In 
the city a four-room house and a yard 
large enough for a grave rents for from 
$10 to $12 per month. The same house 
in the country, with two to three acres 
of land can be rented for $50 to $75 
per year. On such a place a family 
could take care of a horse and cow, 
raise his own pork, and chickens, 
and vegetables to sell, which always 
find a ready market at good prices. 
While the men could find work every 
day for the time they could spare 
from their own ranches, the wo¬ 
men could get plenty of work 
in house cleaning, washing and nurs¬ 
ing. The California farmer is undoubt¬ 
edly the happiest and enjoys more con¬ 
veniences than any other farmer in the 
world. Every community has its 
churches, school and library. His gro¬ 
ceries are delivered at his door, the 
baker delivers his cakes at the same 
place when requested. The daily paper 
is placed on his breakfast table every 
morning. 

Colored men, to live in a city, unless 
you have ample means, is to become a 
consumer and die a pauper, and leave 
your family to the same, if not a worse 
fate.

A NEW ENTERPRISE. 

Several of our prominent gentlemen 
and business men have organized a 
laundry company with a capital stock 
of $1000. Shares are on sale at one 
dollar each. Nearly 200 have been sold 
already. The company will put in a 
complete outfit of modern machinery 
and be prepared to do all kinds of 
work, and hope to give employment to 
a dozen or more people in a short time. 
This is certainly a move in the right 
direction, and will succeed if given a 
trial. The laundries of the city are all 
overworked, and the demand for col¬ 
ored help in this respect was never so 
great as now. 

The company should see that its of¬ 
ficers are thoroughly competent, relia¬ 
ble men, who are intelligent enough to 
know that their own success depends 
upon the success of the company. If 
there is any business capacity among 
us it is time it should make itself 
known in a substantial way. “God 
helps them who help themselves.”

SOUTH PASADENA NOTES. 

South Pasadena real estate has taken 
on quite a boom in the last few weeks. 
Mr. Graves, on Marengo avenue, and 
Mr. Westernfield and Dr. L. B. Lucas, 
on Bonita avenue, sold their places at 
good margins on investments. There 
are a great many prospective buyers in 
town, looking after property every few 
clays. As they are usually well pleased 
with the town and its.splendid future, 
the prospect for many transfers in real 
estate is certain. This is the direct 
result of The Liberator’s advertise¬ 
ment. After reading The Liberator’s 
description of this beautiful suburb and 
its advantages, investigation by those 
wanting homes or seeking safe invest¬ 
ments convinced them that South Pas¬ 
adena is really situated on good land, 
and not altogether off the map. 

The orchards were never in better 
condition at this season of the year 
than now. The recent rains, while 
they did some damage, increased the 
late crops in value 50 per cent. 


PERSONAL. 

The marriages of Messrs. Cawstonand 
R. B. Stevens were notable social 
events, as both gentlemen are import¬ 
ant and well respected citizens. 

* * * * 

Mr. William Westenfield and family 
have gone to Highland to reside with 
their daughter.

new buggies, carriages and surreys.

Mr. Young left a few days ago with 
the body of his wife for Massachusetts, 
where it will be interred.

Mr. R. B. Stevens, our postmaster, 
who was recently married, is one of 
the most popular young man in town. 
He enjoys the confidence and has the 
best wishes of all. We are all proud of 
him.

JOHN BROWN. 

Thou valiant knight of true renown, 
Thou dost wear a martyr’s crown. 

Thy name’s inscribed on history’s page, 
’Gainst bondage thou didst battle wage. 

Thou didst enter in the fight, 

For liberty and truth and right. 

Thy struggle was not all in vain, 

Tho for freedom thou wert slain. 

Thy name will live in song and story. 
Emblazoned in undying glory.— 

And on thy brow a diadem. 

A nation sings thy requiem. 

The conflict’s o’er, the victory’s won, 
But still, thy soul goes marching on. 
All haid! thou HERO, brave John 
Brown, 

Immortal is thy martyr’s crown.

MR. WILLIAM J. THOMPSON, THE 
PLUMBER. 

Mr. Thompson, the only colored busi¬ 
ness man who appeared in the Fiesta 
parade on Wednesday, made a very 
creditable showing. Indeed, if Mr. 
Thompson had not appeared, the race 
would not have been represented. His 
turnout was tastefully decorated and 
elicited much applause. He is an en¬ 
terprising business man, who never 
loses an opportunity to advertise his 
business after the true Western style. 
He possesses the elements that win. 


THE PHILADELPHIA SHOE STORE. 

Mr. N. M. Livingston, manager of the 
Philadelphia Shoe Co., is no stranger 
to the citizens of Pasadena and vi¬ 
cinity. He was in the shoe business 
there several years ago and by hand¬ 
ling only first-class shoes his shoe 
store became one of the best patronized 
in the San Gabriel valley. Owing to 
his large interest in the shoe business 
in the East, he sold out and went there 
several years ago. He has returned to 
Pasadena to reside permanently and 
has opened a shoe store at 34 North 
Fair Oaks avenue, with a large stock 
of ladies’, gents’ and children’s shoes. 
For fine footwear give him a call. He 
is an old shoe man, knows all about 
shoes and knows how to buy, that’s 
the real secret of hi$ success. The an¬ 
nouncement of his return guarantees 
the restoration of his old trade.
