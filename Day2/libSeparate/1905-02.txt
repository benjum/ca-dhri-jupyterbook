How About an Overcoat 

We want you to come in and see the Overcoat we have ready for you—a splendid, serviceable, stylish 
Overcoat that will wear for seasons, the right shape, right style, right quality, and not one penny higher 
in price than you'd pay for an ordinary, every-dav, common overcoat.

THE LIBERATOR. 


The President’s Great 
Speech at the Lincoln 
Dinner. 

The Door of Hope will 
not be Closed Against Us. 

THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. 

The President was introduced by 
Louis Stein, president of the Republican 
Chib, in a brief speech, and as he rose to 
reply, the banqueters in the adjoining 
rooms, crowded into the main hall and 
gallery, every inch of space in which was 
taken. The President said: 

In his second inaugural, in a speech 
which will b e read as long as the mem¬ 
ory of this nation endures, Abraham 
Lincoln closed by saying: 

'‘With malice toward none; with char¬ 
ity for all; with firmness in the right, as 
God gives us to see the right, let us 
strive on to finish the work we are in; 

. . . to do all which may achieve and 

cherish a just and lasting peace among 
ourselves and with all nations." 

Immediately after his re-election he 
had already spoken thus: 

“The strife of the election is but hu¬ 
man nature practically applied to the 
facts of the case. What has occurred in 
this case, must ever recur in similar 
cases. Human nature will not change. 
In any future great national trial, com¬ 
pared with the men of this, we shall have 
as weak and as strong, as silly and as 
wise, as bad and as good. Let us, there¬ 
fore, study the incidents of this as phi¬ 
losophy to learn wisdom from, and none 
of them as wrongs to be avenged. ..May 
not all having a common interest, re¬ 
unite in a common effort to (serve) our 
common country? For my own part, I 
have striven and shall strive to avoid 
placing any obstacle in the way. *So 
long as I have been here I have not will¬ 
ingly planted a thorn in any man’s 
bosom. While I am deeply sensible to 
the high compliment of a re-election, and 
duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty 
God for having directed my countrymen 
to a right conclusion, as I think, for 
their own good, it adds nothing to my 
satisfaction that any other man may be 
disappointed or pained by the result. 

“May I ask those who have not dif¬ 
fered with me to join with me in this 
same spirit toward those who have?" 

This is the spirit in which mighty 


Lincoln sought to bind up the nation's 
wounds when its soul was ^et seething 
with fierce hatreds, with wrath, with 
rancor, with all the evil and dreadful 
passions provoked by civil war. Surely 
this is the spirit which all Americans 
should show now, when there is so little 
excuse for malice or rancor or hatred, 
when there is so little of vital conse¬ 
quence to divide brother from brother. 

APPEAL TO THE SWORD. 

Lincoln, himself a man of southern 
birth, did not hesitate to appeal to. the 
sword when he became satisfied that in 
no other way could the Union be saved, 
for high though he put peace, he put 
righteousness still higher. He warred 
for the Union: he warred to free the 
slave; and when he warred, he warred in 
earnest, for it is a sign of weakness, to 
be half-hearted when blows must be 
struck. But he felt only love, a love as 
deep as the tenderness of his great and 
sad heart, for all his countrymen, alike in 
the North and in the South, and he 
longed above everything for the day 
when they should once more be knit to¬ 
gether in the unbreakable bonds of 
eternal friendship. 

We of today, in dealing with our 
fellow-citizens, white or colored, North 
or south, should strive to show just the 
qualities that Lincoln showed: His 
steadfastness in striving after the right, 
and his infinite patience and forbearance 
with those who saw that right less clear¬ 
ly than he did;his earnest endeavor to do 
what was best, and yet his readiness to 
accept the best that was practicable when 
the ideal best was unattainable ■ his un¬ 
ceasing effort to cure what was evil, 
coupled with his refusal to make a bad 
situation worse by any ill-judged or 
ill-timed effort to make it better. 

The great Civil War in which Lincoln 
towered as the loftiest figure, left us 
not only a re-united country, but a coun¬ 
try which has the proud right to claim 
as its own, the glory won alike by those 
who wore the blue and by those who 
wore the gray, by those wno followed 
Grant and by those who followed Lee; 
for both fought with equal bravery, and 
wtih equal sincerity of conviction, each 
striving for the light, as it was given 
him to see the light; though it is now 
clear to all, that the triumph of the cause 
of freedom and of the Union, was essen¬ 
tial to the welfare of mankind. We are 
now one people, a people with failings 


which we must not blink, but a people 
with great qualities in whih we have 
the right to feel just pride. 
FRIENDSHIP FOR THE SOUTH. 

All good Americans who dwell in the 
North, must, because they are good 
Americans, feel the most earnest friend¬ 
ship for their fellow-countrymen who 
dwell in the South, a friendship all the 
greater, because it is in the South, that 
we find in its most acute phase, one of 
the gravest problems before our peo¬ 
ple: the problem of so dealing with the 
man of one color as to secure him the 
rights that no one would grudge him 
if he were another color. To solve this 
problem it is of course, necessary to 
educate him to perform the duties 
a failure to oerform which will render 
him a curse to himself and to all around 
him. 

Most certainly all clear-sighted and 
generous men in the North appreciate 
the difficulty and nerplexity of this prob¬ 
lem, sympathize with the South in the 
embarrassment of conditions for which 
she is not alone responsible, feel an 
honest wish to help her, where help is 
practicable, and have the heartiest re¬ 
spect for those brave and earnest men 
of the South, who, in the face of fear¬ 
ful difficulties, are doing all that men 
can do for the betterment alike of white 
and black. The attitude of the North 
toward the negro is far from what it 
should be, and there is need that 
the North also, should act in good 
faith, upon the principle of giving to 
each man what is justly due to him, 
of treating him on his worth as a man, 
granting him no special favors, but de¬ 
nying him no proper opportunity for la¬ 
bor, and the reward of labor. But the pe¬ 
culiar circumstances of the South, ren¬ 
der the problem there far greater, and 
far more acute. 

Neither I, nor any other man, can say 
that any given way of approaching 
that problem will present in our time, 
even an approximately perfect solution, 
but we can safely say, that there can 
never be such solution at all unless 
we approach it with the effort to do fair 
and equal justice among all men; and to 
demand from them “ return, just and 
fair treatment for others. Our effort 
should be to secure to each man, what¬ 
ever his color, equality of opportunity, 
equality of treatment before the law. As 
a people striving to shape our actions 







3 


in accordance with the great law of 
righteousness, we cannot offord to take 
take part in or be indifferent to, the 
oppression or maltreatment of any man, 
who, ,against crushing disadvantages 
has by his own industry, ener^v, self- 
respect and perseverance, struggled up¬ 
ward to a position which would entitle 
him to the respect of his fellows, if only 
his skin were of a different hue. 

Every generous impulse in us revolts 
at the thought of thrusting down, in¬ 
stead of helping up such a man. To 
deny any man the fair treatment granted 
to others no better than he, is to com¬ 
mit a wrong upon him—a wrong sure to 
react in the long run upon those guilty 
of such denial. The only safe principle 
upon which Americans can act is that 
of “all men up,” not that of “some men 
down.” If in any community the level 
of intelligence , morality, and thrift 
among the colored men can be raised, 
it is, humanly speaking, sure that the 
same level among the whites will be 
raised to an even higher degree; and it 
is no less sure, that the debasement of 
the blacks will in the end carry with it 
an attendant abasement of the whites. 

The problem is to so adjust the re¬ 
lations between the two races of dif¬ 
ferent ethnic type, that the rights of 
neither be abridged nor jeoparded; 
that the backward race be trained so 
that it may enter into possession of 
true freedom, while the forward race 
is enabled to preserve unharmed the 
high civilization wrought out by its 
fore-fathers. The working out of this 
problem must necessarily be slow; it is 
not possible in of-hand fashion to ob¬ 
tain or to confer the priceless boons of 
freedom, industrial efficiency, political 
capacity, and domestic morality. 

Nor is it only necessary to train the 
colored man ; it is quite as necessary to 
train the white man, for on his shoulders 
rests a well-nigh unparalleled sociologi¬ 
cal responsibility. It is a problem de¬ 
manding the best thought, the utmost 
patience, the most earnest effort, the 
broadest charity, of the statesman, the 
student, the philanthropist, of the lead¬ 
ers of thought in every department of 
our national life. The church can be 
a most important factor in solving it 
aright. But above all else, we need for 
its successful solution the sober, kindly 
steadfast, unselfish performance of duty 
by the average plain citizen in his every¬ 
day dealings with his fellows. 


THE LIBERATOR. 

The ideal of elemental justice meted 
out to every man is the ideal we should 
keep ever before us. It will be many 
a long day before we attain to it, and un¬ 
less we show not only devotion to it, 
but also wisdom and self-restraint in the 
exhibition of that devotion-, we shall 
defer the time for its realization still 
further. In striving to attain so much 
of it as concerns dealing with men of 
different colors, we must remember two 
things. 

FATE OF THE NEGRO. 

In the first place it is true of the 
colored man, as it is true of the white 
man, that in the long run, his fate must 
depend far more unon his own efforts, 
than upon the efforts of any outside 
friend. Every vicious, venal, or ignorant 
colored man is an even greater foe to 
his own race than to the community as a 
whole. The colored man’s self respect 
entitles *.im to do tnat share in the po¬ 
litical work of the country which is war¬ 
ranted his individual ability and in¬ 
tegrity, and the position which he has 
won for himself. But the prime requisite 
of the race, is moral and industrial up¬ 
lifting. 

Laziness and shiftlessness, these, and 
above all, vice and criminality of every 
kind, are evils more potent for harm to 
the black race than all acts of oppression 
of the white man put together. The 
colored man who fails to condemn crime 
in another colored man, who fails to co¬ 
operate in all lawful ways in bringing 
colored criminals to justice, is the worst 
enemy of his own people, as well as an 
enemy to all the peonle. Law abiding 
black men should, for the sake of their 
race, be foremost in relentless and un¬ 
ceasing wargare against law-breaking 
black men. If the standards of private 
morality and industrial efficiency can be 
raised high enough among the black race, 
then its future on this continent is se¬ 
cure. The stability and minty of the 
home, is vital to the welfare of the black 
race, as it is to the welfare of every race. 

In the next place, the white man, 

who, if only he is willing, can help the 
colored man more than all other white 

men put together, is the white man 

who is his neighbor, North or South. 
Each of us must do his whole duty 
without flinching, and if that duty is 
national it must be done in accordance 
with the principles above laid down. 

But in endeavoring each to be his 


brother's keeper it is wise to remem¬ 
ber that each can normally do most 
for the brother who is his immediate 
neighbor. If we are sincere friends of 
the negro It us each in his own local¬ 
ity show it tw his action therein, and 
let us each show it also by upholding 
the hands of the white man, in what¬ 
ever locality, who is striving to do jus¬ 
tice to the poor and the helpless, to 
be a shield to those whose need for 
such a shield is great. 

CRUSADE AGAINST LYNCHING. 

The heartiest acknowledgments are 
due to the ministers, the judges and 
law officers* the grand juries, the pub¬ 
lic men, and the great daily newspa¬ 
pers in the South, who have recently 
done such effective work in leading 
the crusade against lynching in the 
South ; and I am glad to say that dur¬ 
ing the last three months the returns, 
as far as they can be gathered, show 
a smaller number of lynchings than 
for any other two months during the 
last twenty years. Let us uphold in 
every way the hands of the men who 
have led in this work who are striv¬ 
ing to do all their work in this spirit. 
I am about to quote from the address 
of the Rt. Rev. Bishop Strange, bishop 
coadjutor of North Carolina, as given 
in the Southern Churchman of October 
8, 1904. 

The bishop first enters an emphatic 
plea against any social intermingling 
of the races; a question which must, 
of course, be left to the people of each 
community to settle for themselves, as 
in such a matter no one community— 
and indeed no one individual—can dic¬ 
tate to any other; always provided 
that in each locality men keep in mind 
the fact that there must be no con¬ 
fusing of civil privileges with social 
intercourse. Civil law cannot regulate 
social practices. Society, as such, is 
a law unto itself, and will always reg¬ 
ulate its own practices and habits. Full 
recognition of the fundamental fact that 
all men should stand on an equal foot¬ 
ing, as regards civil privileges, in no 
way interferes with recognition of the 
further fact that all reflecting men of 
both rar^s 3re united in feeling that race 
puritv must be maintained. The bishop 
continues: 

“What should the white men of the 
South do for the ne^ro? They must 
give him a free hand, a fair field, and a

"A SQUARE DEAL.” 

Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish in full the President’s great speech 
at the Lincoln dinner given in New York 
on the 13th. To say it is a great speech 
does not describe it. It is a remarkable 
speech of the most remarkable man of 
the age. On the propositions of “a 
square deal,” of “all men up rather than 
some men down,” and of keeping the 
“door of hope open to all,” he stands as 
solid as a rock. Upon the bedrock prin¬ 
ciples on which he stands, this Republic 
must stand or it will fall. “Equal rights 
for all and social privileges for none” 
must be our living and practiced creed. 
The negro needs no special or class leg¬ 
islation. It is class legislation that he is 
trying to get rid of. All he asks is the 
enforcement of the federal constitution 
and amendments. This will inflict hard¬ 
ship upon no individual who is worthy 
of the boon of American citizenship. 

His advice to the colored citizens to 
prove themselves worthy of American 
citizenship by the development and exer¬ 
cise of those manly virtues that good 


THE LIBERATOR. 

citizenship requires, comes like the ad¬ 
vice of father to son. Colored men and 
women, read that speech carefully, 
thoughtfully, prayerfully, and then act 
accordingly. 

His charge that the free Christian peo¬ 
ple of the North are not wholly just in 
their treatment of the negro is all too 
true. The fact that in this and other 
Northern cities labor unions composed 
of Christian men and women close the 
door of opportunity to colored persons 
simply on account of their color, is a 
sad commentary on their religious pre¬ 
tentions. Take, for instance, the great 
department stores and other institutions 
which employ thousands of young men 
at d women. They close their doors to 
young colored persons, no matter how 
worthy, for no other reason than that 
their skins are dark. In politics there is 
a studied and persistent effort to cheat 
the negro out of the fruits of his polit¬ 
ical power. 

Long live Roosevelt, the friend and 
President of all the American people. 


GEN. LEW WALLACE PASSES TO 
HIS REWARD. 

Gen. Lew Wallace, warrior, author 
and statesman, has passed to his re¬ 
ward. His was a remarkable career, 
and what he has done to make the world 
better through the medium of his pen 
places him among the immortals. His 
books, ‘‘Ben Hur,” the “Fair God,” and 
other productions, are to nosterity price¬ 
less legacies. The men who rescue na¬ 
tions from oblivion are their liberators 
who unshackle the limbs, and authors 
who liberate the mind fr^m the thral¬ 
dom of ignorance and open to them the 
inexhaustible domain of usefulness and 
happiness—that is the privilege of only 
the enlightened minds. The statesman 
and warrior perish with the states, but 
the great writer whose -en is devoted 
to the elevation of the mind lives on 
forever. 


SENATOR PENDLETON. 

By the appointment of Editor T. A. 
Greene and Capt, F. H. Crumbly to 
clerkships in the Assembly, the colored 
voters of this city have been given 
the most fitting representation ever given 
in that department of the public service. 
It is the recognition of the negro’s intel¬ 
lectual qualifications. Heretofore the 


cleaning of cuspidors around the State 
Capitol was considered sufficient reward 
to the negro for keeping the Republican 
party in power. The gentlemen appoint¬ 
ed are both well fitted and in every way 
worthy of the positions they hold. Sen¬ 
ator Pendleton has honored every negro 
in this State and they will not forget 
him when election day comes around. 
He is a capable broad-gauge young man 
with great possibilities. 


THAT MOSCOW TRAGEDY. 

The assassination of Grand Duke Ser¬ 
gius of Russia, while it is deplorable 
in every respect, is the punishment that 
comes to nations that tolerate oppres¬ 
sion. Nations, like individuals, suffer 
for sins. “The soul that sinneth shall 
die.” The same is true of nations. Rev¬ 
olutions, murder of rulers, wars and na¬ 
tional death is the price they pay for 
permitting crimes against the weak. The 
laws of God are inexorable; none can es¬ 
cape. The policy of unfortunate Rus¬ 
sia is at variance with the age, and 
sooner or later will have to yield to the 
inevitable. The world is moving toward 
universal freedom and equality among 
men, and those who attempt to arrest 
its progress will be # wiped out. 

Despotism is doomed. The strong 
anywhere can trample upon the rights 
of the weak, but it cannot escape the 
penalty. The decrees of God are eternal. 


HILL AND WARNER. 

Messrs. E. G. Hill and G. M. Warner, 
both holders of valuable real estate in 
this city, have each purchased splendid 
ranches upon which they are raising 
crops, and have good prospects for a 
large yield. This is a move in the right 
direction and should be followed by ev¬ 
ery colored citizen who has a few dol¬ 
lars ahead. A thousand dollars in the 
bank will earn 3 or 4 P er cent and open 
for vou not a single job. The same 
invested in good country property will 
not only furnish employment for mem¬ 
bers of the race, but ill a short time will 
earn 25 to 50 oer cent.

cordial godspeed, the two races work¬ 
ing together for their mutual benefit 
and for the development of our com¬ 
mon country. He must have liberty, 
equal opportunity to make his living, 
to earn his bread, to build his home. 
He must have justice, equal rights, and 
protection before the law. He must 
have the same political nrivileges; the 
suffrage should be based on character 
and intelligence for white and black 
alike. He must have the same public 
advantages of education; the public 
schools are for all the people, what¬ 
ever their color or condition. The 
white men of the South should give 
hearty and respectful consideration to 
the exceptional men of the negro race, 
to those who have the character, the 
ability and the desire to be lawyers, 
physicians, teachers, preachers, lead¬ 
ers of thought and conduct among 
their own men and women. We should 
give them cheer and opportunity to 
gratify every laudable ambition, and to 
seek every innocent satisfaction among 
their own people. Finally, the best 
white men of the South should have 
frequent conferences with the best col¬ 
ored men, where, in frank earnest and 
symnathetic discussion they might un¬ 
derstand each other better, smooth dif¬ 
ficulties, and so guide and encourage 
the weaker race.” 

Surely we can all of us join in ex¬ 
pressing our substantial agreement with 
the principles thus laid down by this 
North Carolina bishop, this representa¬ 
tive of the Christian thought of the 
South. 

I am speaking on the occasion of the 
celebration of the birthday of Abraham 
Lincoln, and to men who count it their 
peculiar privilege that they have the right 
to hold Lincoln’s memory dear, and the 
duty to strive to work along the lines 
that he laid down. We can pay most 
fitting homage to his memory by doing 
the tasks allotted to us in the spirit in 
which he did the infinitely greater and 
more terrible tasks allotted to him. 

Let us be steadfast for the right; 
but let us err on the side of generosity 
rather than on the side of vindictive¬ 
ness toward those who differ from us 
as to the method of attaining the right 
Lt us never forget our duty to help in 
uplifting the lowly, to shield from wrong 
the humble; and let us likewise act in a 
spirit of the broadest and frankest gen¬ 
erosity toward all our brothers, all our 


l uiv. 

fellow-countrymen; in a spirit proceed¬ 
ing not from weakness, but from 
strength, a spirit which takes no more 
account of locality than it does of class 
or of creed; a spirit which is resolutely 
bent on seeing that the Union which 
Washington founded and which Lincoln 
saved from destruction shall grow no¬ 
bler and greater-throughout the ages. 

I believe in this country with all my 
heart and soul. I believe that our peo¬ 
ple will in the end rise level to every 
need, will in the end triumph over every 
difficulty that arises before them. I 
could not have such confident faith in 
the destiny of this mighty people if I 
had it merely as regards one portion of 
that people. Throughout our land things 
on the whole have grown better and not 
worse, and this is as true of one part 
of the country as it is of another. I 
believe in the southerner as I believe 
in the northerner. I claim the right to 
feel pride in his great qualities and in 
his great deeds exactly as I feel pride 
in the great qualities and deeds of every 
other American. For weal or for woe. 
we are knit together, and we shall go 
up or go down together; and I believe 
that we shall go up and not down, that 
we shall go forward instead of halting 
and falling back, because I have an abid¬ 
ing faith in the generosity, the couiagt-, 
the resolution and the common sense of 
all my countrymen. 

FACING PROBLEMS. 

The Southern States face difficult 
problems; and so do the Northern 
States. Some of the problems are the 
same for the entire country. Others 
exist in greater intensity in one sec¬ 
tion, and yet others exist in greater in¬ 
tensity in another section. But in the 
end they will all be solved; for funda¬ 
mentally our people are the same 
throughout this land; the same in the 
qualities of heart and brain and hand 
which have made this republic what 
it is in the great today; which will 
make it what it is to be in the infi¬ 
nitely greater tomorrow. I admire and 
respect and believe in and have faith 
in the men and women of the South 
as I admire and respect and believe in 
and have faith in the men and women 
of the North. All of us alike, north¬ 
erners and southerners, easterners and 
westerners, can best prove our fealty 
to the nation's past by the way in which 
we do the nation’s work in the present; 


for only thus can we be sure that our 
children's children shall inherit Abra¬ 
ham Lincoln’s single-hearted devotion to 
the great unchanging creed that “right¬ 
eousness exalteth a nation.” 

The President received an ovation 
at the end o f his speech, and many 
times during his address he was forced 
to pause until the diners had made man¬ 
ifest their approval of his utterances. 


Pasadena, Cal., Jan. 28, 1905. 
Editor Liberator, 

Los Angeles, Cal. 

Dear Sir:—Please accept my congrat¬ 
ulations on your splendid January num¬ 
ber. It is inspiring to read it. I have 
read The Liberator, never missing a 
number, since its first appearance and 
have found it always fighting for the up¬ 
building of the race. 

I have read all of the colored papers 
published in this State and find that The 
Liberator has given more space to adver¬ 
tise and encourage race enterprises than 
all of the others put together, and the 
thing that I do not understand is that 
your paper is so poorly suppored by the 
negro business men. 

I understand that there are four or 
fice colored grocery stores in your city 
and not one of them has a card in your 
paper, or, in fact, any negro paper. After 
studying over this matter I came to the 
conclusion that too many of the negro 
business men are just as slow about pat¬ 
ronizing race enterprises as the average 
negro. 

White business men who want busi¬ 
ness advertise, and I notice that many of 
them advertise in your paper because 
they want some of the colored trade. If 
the colored grocers and negroes engaged 
in business want their race to patronize 
them, why don't they advertise in race 
papers, especially in your paper that is 
spending money to advertise them. I 
tell you, Mr. Edmonds, I don’t under¬ 
stand it; your paper is well read, and is 
regarded by white and colored people 
capable of judging as one of the best 
papers of its kind published in the State. 
I tell you the negro business men ought 
to practice what they preach—patronize 
race enterprises. The man who lifts the 
collection has as much right to throw in

DO COLORED BUSINESS MEN 
PATRONIZE RACE EN¬ 
TERPRISES? 

Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish a letter from Mr. Alfred Summers, 
a prominent citizen of Pasadena, in 
which he discusses at some length the 
attitude of colored business men toward 
race enterprises. Its perusal will doubt¬ 
less be beneficial to those of the race 
who are interested in its advancement. 
We regret to admit that the charges 
made against our business men are too 
well founded, and hope that the appear¬ 
ance of their cards in some race jour¬ 
nal will place them in the attitude of 
consistency. Our business men are by 
force of circumstances leaders, and a dis¬ 
play of a little less selfishness on their 
part might greatly enhance their busi¬ 
ness. If we even had the aid of our 
business men by way of subscriptions 
for the paper it would increase our fa¬ 
cilities for eduacting our people to pat¬ 
ronize their stores. What we need, Bro. 
Summers, is a few more wide-awake, 
business men like Mr. T. B. Walker oc 
your city. His card is to be seen in 
several race papers. This has much to 
do with his popularity and business suc¬ 
cess. 

Because the services a man is trying 
to render needy people are not appre¬ 
ciated, is absolutely no reason for their 
discontinuance. The negro race has got 
to be lifted up. If the negro of the pres¬ 
ent does not appreciate the survices of 
those who are carrying the load, a gen¬ 
eration is coming that will. To labor 
and make sacrifices to broaden the op¬ 
portunities of the little boys and girls 
that are looking to us men of today; to 
put their little feet in the right paths, is 
the sweetest and most sacred duty that 
can fall to the lot of man. That's what we 
are tryoing to do, and the washerwomen, 
and men like Bro. Summers who carry 
the hod and' do other similar labor, are 
standing by us loyally. If our labors 
contribute in the least to the advance¬ 
ment of the race, they will not have been 
in vain. That of itself is an imperish¬ 
able reward. But for the present let us 
put away selfishness and concentrate our 
efforts to uplift the race. “Today is 
the day of salvation.”

We are pleased to put on our ex¬ 
change list the St. Josenh Radical of St.
