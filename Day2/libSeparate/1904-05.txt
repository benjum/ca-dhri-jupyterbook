Hr. Moseley’s Address. 

Another Valuable Contribution to 
American Literature. 

E. W. Moseley: Mr. Chairman, Fath- 
ers and Brethren in General Confer¬ 
ence assembled: I wish to preface my 
short message with thanks from all 
the members of the Colored Methodist 
Episcopal Church in America that I am 
privileged to carry back to them the 
news that you have given to Africa 
and to our people a negro bishop in the 
person of Dr. 1 . B. Scott. 

I esteem this hour as one of the 


liant line of colossal achievements and 
her record is on high. She has within 
her ranks men of all stations and posi¬ 
tions in life. She has sought always 
to alleviate the distresses of mankind 
and heal the broken hearted and lift 
the fallen, whether white or black, to 
higher planes. And the world is well 
acquainted with your doings and glor¬ 
ious achievements. Your bishops are 
great councilors in the Republic of Re¬ 
ligion and by their works have reared 
a mountain of greatness that no earthly 
power can destroy. 

The Rev. Dr. Brooks, in his greetings 
to our General Conference in May, 1902, 
brought your message in an eloquent 
address, in beautiful language and 


sands of dollars annually in our inter¬ 
est, thereby aiding us in maintain¬ 
ing our institutions of learning. Our; 
march has been steady and the results 
gratifying. Our early history was 
fraught with trouble from within and 
poverty within, but during the flight 
of years the church grew in power and 
influence, and after a lapse of over 
thirty years we look upon the early 
days of our history with pride and 
gratification as an epoch great in re¬ 
ligious activity and fruitfulness. From 
two bishops and fewer than a dozen 
conferences in 1870, we now have fivq 
bishops and twenty-six Annual Con¬ 
ferences. Our bishops are true and 
tried followers of the meek and lowly 
Christ. 

Our present financial system is 
operated without friction, and brought 
to the church last year the best re¬ 
sults in its history. 

We regret to inform you that our 
Senior Bishop, the Rev. J. A. Beebe, 
after an illness of several months, died 
June 6, 1903. His death caused a gen¬ 
eral mourning throughout the church. 
He died in peace at the age of eighty 
years. 

Our ministers preach always the gos¬ 
pel of Christ, '1 hev believe in the im¬ 
mortality of the soul and argue that 
man cannot see God unless he is born 
again. 


“For our death is but a sleep and a 
forgetting, 

The soul that rises with us, our Iifes 
star, 

Has had elsewhere its setting. 

Not in entire forgetfulness, nor yet in 
utter nakedness, 

But in trailing clouds of glory do we 
come 

From God, Who is our home/' 

Out of the labors of these God-called 
men thousands of souls are led into the 
fold of Christ. They preach the cross 
of Him because the hope of the world 
hangs theeron. 

“And if a word of theirs another’s 
gloom has brightened, 

Through their dumb lips the heaven 
sent message came; 

If hands of theirs another’s task has 
lightened, 

It felt the guidance that it dares not 
claim/* 


REV. E, W.. MOPETj'EV. n P. 


happiest in my ministerial life to de¬ 
liver to you the fraternal greetings of 
a sister church, a young but progres¬ 
sive daughter of Methodism. I fully 
realize the importance of the occasion, 
and beg pardon for any shortcomings 
whatever. I assure you, however, that 
the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church 
is in hearty sympathy with you, and I 
now take pleasure in bearing to you 
the greetings of this young daughter of 
Wesley. We are aware of the fact that 
the Methodist Episcopal Church is a 
great church. Her history is one bril¬ 


chaste diction. He made an able pre¬ 
sentiment of your church and its work. 
Sirs, we rejoice in all your triumphs 
and bid you Godspeed in all the in¬ 
terests committed to your care and 
the work that you are doing for God 
and humanity. 

The Colored Methodist Episcopal 
Church was organized in 1870, before 
which time we were a part of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, South. 
The separation did not divorce our 
mother in her sympathy and love for 
us. That church contributes thou¬ 


We are glad to say that our church 
emphasizes the necessity of high moral 
conduct on the part of her preachers. 
For this reason no immoral preachers 
are kept among us. Our ministers are 
reciuired to hold up the standard of 
morality, to marry no divorced woman, 
but to stay with those they marry, for 
“Like priest like people/* 

While we believe in policies and 
know them to be essential to a nati/n's 
welfare, as a church we are non- 
political. Whatever party will con 
tinue prosperity, whatever party will 
do more for the upbuilding of God’s 
Kingdom, that is the party that we 
wish in power. We are pledged to no 
political organization, we are tied to

no league. As individuals we vote for 
the men we believe are best qualified 
to administer the affairs of this great 
government of ours. 

Our church advocates temperance, 
and the result is a sane and sober- 
minded people. V/c hold that water 
should be the only beverage, for it is 
pure, abundant and needful. Whether 
it ripples and laughs over the rocks of 
many rills or thunders and pours over 
the falls of Niagara; whether it foams 
or bubbles on the waves of the deep or 
oozes from the spout of some lofty 
fountain, it is water that answers the 
immediate wants of mankind. It is the 
purest beverage in all the world, and we 
long for its supremacy. King Alcohol 
should be overthrown, for it is the 
greatest foe of man, an enemy of soci¬ 
ety and a destroyer of home. 

We believe in the education of the 
head, the hands and the heart. We 
have a number of institutions that are 
doing a grand and noble work. Lane 
College at Jackson, Tenn.; Texas Col¬ 
lege in Texas; Haygood in Arkansas; 
Paine College in Georgia, fostered by 
the Methodist Episcopal Church, 
South, and presided over by the Rev. 
C. William Walker, D. D., of the Meth¬ 
odist Episcopal Church, South. Every 
year a goodly number of young men 
and women go from their walls to per¬ 
form their part in the uplifting of the 
race. There are many other schools or 
lesser importance under our fostering 
care, and their work is commendable 
and noteworthy. Our ministers and 
people believe in the power of intellect, 
foi when it is developed ignorance can 
get no foothold. Where there fs no 
ignorance there is peace and where 
there is peace there is God, Who sits 
upon a throne and rules heaven and 
earth therefrom. Thus we conclude 
that Christianity and civilization only 
grow as the intellect of man is broad¬ 
ened and improved. Therefore, a man 
should not be judged by the texture of 
the hair nor the complexion ot the 
skin “For the mind is the standard of 
the man. 5 ' 

Again, I come to thank your great 
church for opening wide the doors of 
your colleges and universities to the 
young men and women of my church 
when we had no schools of our own. 
Some of the brightest minds in Colored 
Methodism are the products of Walden, 
Rush, Wiley and Gammon, Hooper, 
Braden, Thirkield, Hubbard, Crogman, 
Bowen, Scott, Byrd, Dogan and Miss 
Mamie Braden are household words, in 
Colored Methodism. Bishops Phillips, 
Williams, Cottrell and Editor Brown of 
the Christian Index are the products of 
Walden and Tiley Universities. 

We have been enabled to give to the 
church and face a wholesome literature. 
Bishops Holsey and Williams are 
authors of books .that are largely read. 
Their books of sermons and addresses 
arc worthy pieces of literature. Bishops 
Lane and Cottrell have done some lit¬ 
erary work, and besides the beautiful 


and interesting history of the Church 
by Bishop Phillips, we have a host ot 
other writers on every subject that con¬ 
fronts the people. We have a mission¬ 
ary department, church extension and 
woman’s missionary societies. They en¬ 
deavor to answer the question “Am I 
my brother's keeper.” We are broth¬ 
erly. Those loyal preachers of our 
church who have crossed the river left 
behind them mourning children and 
broken-hearted widows. For them we 
have a fraternal feeling and seek to help 
and cherish them. Every year thousands 
of dollars are raised for the support of 
these unfortunate people and by so 
doing we lighten the hearts of many 
and gladden the souls of thousands; and 
out of this fraternal feeling this great 
family of Wesleyan followers go on 
from conquest to conqueror and from 
earth to glory. 

Our churches are many and usetul. 
Never before in the history ot our 
church have we been blessed with 
greater prosperity^. On every hand new 
places of worship are being erected. 
Buildings that are a credit to any people 
or church are now owned by us. Our 
magnificent publishing house, located at 
Jackson, Tenn., issues our own litera¬ 
ture, both general and church. The 
Christian Index is published there and 
is self-supporting. Thus it is evident 
that we have a house for every emer¬ 
gency. Our laity is loyal and true to 
every interest of the church of their 
choice. Among us are lawyers, doctors, 
poets, scholars, orators, teachers and 
laborers; in fact, it is composed of men, 
women and children that do everything 
for a livelihood. There are 250,000 
members, and 2,000 traveling preachers. 
There are five bishops, 150,000 Sunday 
school teachers. Sirs, in behalf of this 
great phalanx of Christian soldiers, I 
again greet you. We greet you because 
ot your greatness—because of your 
power and influence, and, with you, we 
look back over your past history with 
ecstacy and gratification. Your many 
years of marching and song have bene¬ 
fited the entire world, and out of it there 
has come a religious empire on which 
the sun never sets. The time is coming 
when Methodism in general shall gain 
greater triumphs. 

When Scipio, the great Roman gen¬ 
eral, left his home in Italy and warred 
in Africa, he was ■ successful. He con¬ 
quered and put to flight the Carthagin¬ 
ian army. He burned and pillaged the 
city and frightened Hannibal into exile 
and returned home the victor. For fif¬ 
teen years Hannibal had been a terror to 
Rome, but his time had come, his course 
was ended and he succumbed to the in¬ 
evitable. Scipio returned to Rome the 
conqueror. So shall it be with the 
mighty army of the living God. They 
shall yet triumph over death, hell and 
the grave. Satan will finally be sub¬ 
dued, and the evil influences that now 
degrade mankind will yet fall at the feet 
of the “Man of Galilee.” The prince 
of darkness will yet be overthrown, and 


whether like Hannibal he goes off and 
dies at his own hands or not, the great 
host of God will finallly see his end. 
The Colored Methodist Episcopal 
Church is doing her part by this great 
Christian warfare. 

“That blame and satire fiercely hurled 
By shouting priest and ranting sage, 
Will not elevate a fallen world 
And usher in the golden age. 

Bui deeds of gentle\faith and love 
Will bring the kingdom from above, 
And give to man the greater worth.” 

With reference to the treatment of my 
race in this country, both North and 
South, I come to ask your sympathy 
and prayers. Unless a change is wrought 
wherein the supremacy of the law is 
upheld, the negro’s sense of manhood 
and love of liberty will force him to 
pick up his tent and seek shelter under 
some other flag. 

Gov. Vardanian of Mississippi would 
have the people of this country believe 
that the educated negro is unfit for in¬ 
telligent citizenship. His doctrine is not 
only dangerous but misleading, for if 
our friends North and South were to 
believe it and withdraw their sympathy 
and. aid, we would be friendless in 
Christian America. If this government 
would retain its place among the en¬ 
lightened governments of the world; if 
the superior race would maintain its 
superiority, the “brother in black” must 
b»" remembered kindly for his labors, 
and the place he has filled in the past. 
Let blind prejudice continue its unholy 
mission, let violence run unrestrained, 
and let the black man’s face serve as a 
bar to all that is noble, enjoyable and 
sufficient to make him desire happiness 
in common with his white brother, 
thereby taking from him. the very es¬ 
sence of life, then this government, with 
it., haughty rulers will take its place 
among the fallen governments and races 
of the past who, despising their broth¬ 
ers, despise themselves. God gave them 
over to their wicked devices and they 
destroyed each other. 

“But since right is right and God is 
right, 

Right at last will win.” 

Thus, in the opening yenrs of this glo¬ 
rious twentieth century, when science 
and philosophy are accomplishing so 
much, when literature and art are pleas¬ 
ing and starting the word, when Christi¬ 
anity and civilization are making such 
rapid strides, we are encouraged by the 
advice of the immortal Longfellow, who 
said: 

“Be still sad heart and cease repining, 
Behind the cloud is the sun still shin¬ 
ing; 

Thy fate is the common fate of all; 

Into each life some rain must fall, 

Some days must be dark and dreary.” 

And now in conclusion, may the be¬ 
nign influence of Him who came from

THE NEGRO EXODUS FROM 
MISSISSIPPI. 

The hostile attitude of the white peo¬ 
ple of Mississippi toward the negro and 
his rights is having a bad effect upon 
the white farmers of that state. The 
negroes are leaving in large numbers, 
depopulating rich agricultural sections. 
The attempt to lay the blame upon Gov¬ 
ernor Vardaman will not relieve the sit¬ 
uation. Governor Vardaman was elected 
governor of Mississippi upon an anti¬ 
negro platform. Upon that platform he 
defeated two high-toned Mississippi 
statesmen who refused to commit them¬ 
selves to the policy of nullification and 
anarchy. Vandaman’s position on the 
negro question was thoroughly under¬ 
stood by the white voters of Mississippi 
six months before the electfon. His 
proposition to close the negro schools 
and to cause the exactment of peonage 
laws that would reduce the negroes of 
that state to a condition worse than 
slavery gave him the election over his 
opponents, who deemed such a policy 
suicidal. To attempt to lay the blame 
for the present negro exodus upon Gov¬ 


ernor Vandaman is cowardly to say the 
least. The argument that these suicidal 
attempts to destroy the rights of the 
negro were merely aimed at the shift¬ 
less classes are not borne out by later 
developments. If the closing of the 
schools for the higher education of the 
negroes were not aimed at the better 
class what other class could they have 
hoped to reach. 

It is only the better class of negroes ' 
and whites that give their children 
higher education. The shiftless classes 
of neither race care not whether their 
children attend any school. The negro 
children who attend institutions for 
higher education are the sons and 
daughters of industrious, law-abiding 
parents, who pay taxes, own and con¬ 
duct farms, run stores and other busi¬ 
ness. The closing of these schools is a 
mortal blow aimed at this class. That 
they are selling their property at a sac¬ 
rifice and are leaving the state by the 
thousands is not to be wondered at. 
Their very acts are proof of their value 
as citizens. There is plenty of room in 
the great West for every honest, indus¬ 
trious man and woman. And those who 
come towards the setting sun will find 
freedom and plenty of schools of all 
grades for the free education of their 
children and boundless opportunities for 
the acquisition of wealth The condi¬ 
tions of the intelligent, industrious, tax- 
paying negroes of Mississippi is sad, but 
the condition of the great body of ne¬ 
groes of that state who earn their living 
by laboring on farms is deplorable in 
the extreme. The peonage law, known 
as “The Wells Vagrant Law,” creates a 
system of peonage the like of which the 
world has never seen. It restores the 
auction block, the bull whip and brings 
the bloodhound again into service. The 
effect of this law, together with the clos¬ 
ing of the schools will cause hundreds 
of thousands of acres of Mississippi 
farm lands to grow up with weeds and 
brushes. The attempt of the Missis- 
sippians to re-enslave the negroes by 
class legislation will only result in ruin 
for those they are intended to benefit. 
Their policy is not in keeping with this 
age; it is at variance with Christianity, 
morality and civilization; it is an at¬ 
tempt to turn back the dial of progress; 
it is a nullification of every tenet of 
civilized society. The right to leave 
that state is not yet denied all of the 
negroes, so while the sun shines they 
are fleeing into all of the border states, 
and those who are able are finding 
hemes all over the Pacific coast. 


THE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR. 

The pro-Russian napers ot this coun¬ 
try have endeavored to create sympathy 
for Russia in the present war between 
that country and Japan by appealing to 
race prejudice, arguing that the Japs 
should be denied fair play in the strug¬ 
gle on account of their color and nation¬ 
ality. The contention that the war in 
the Far East is a war between Chris¬ 
tian and pagan, the white race and the 


yellow, and arguing that as a reason 
why Russia should have the sympathy 
ot this or any other nation is dodging 
the real issue involved. Before taking 
sides with either of the combatants we 
should ascertain, if possible, which is 
right. If it is right for Russia to steal 
the territory of a sister nation because 
the nation so wronged is unable to de¬ 
fend itself—if it is Christianity to steal 
another’s property because you have the 
power to do so, then Russia should have 
the sympathy of all Christian peoople. 
On the the contrary, if the Japs’ conten¬ 
tion is right, which seems to be gen¬ 
erally admitted, then all lovers of justice 
and fair play are with Japan. To ap¬ 
peal to race prejudice is an admission 
that the one so appealing is conscious 
that he and his cause is wrong. The 
Japanese are fighting to preserve the in¬ 
tegrity of their nation. Russia is sacri¬ 
ficing her men and money to take terri¬ 
tory to which she has no right. The 
success of her efforts means her ulti¬ 
mate absorption of Japan. The fact that 
the Japs know this and are taking time 
by the forelock to prevent it entitles 
them to the sympathy and encourage¬ 
ment of enlightened humanity. If the 
religion of Jesus Christ is to conquer 
the world and the fatherhood of God 
and the brotherhood of man is to 
be universally acknowledged, it seems 
a little late to be contending that 
this or that race or color was 
ordained of God to rule the world. 
Or the contrary, the energies of the 
present generation should be exerted in 
spreading the gospel of the divine right 
of men to have and enjoy whatever they 
honestly acquire. If power to run the 
affairs of the world is the goal of any 
race or nation it can only be reached by 
the destruction of Christianity and an 
utter disregard for the rights of the 
weak. In the present war the Japs have 
won the admiration of the world, not 
only for their gallantry in battle, but 
foi their kindness and humane treat¬ 
ment of the unfortunate wounded Rus¬ 
sians that have fallen into their hands 
The kindness and fellow feeling for the 
Russian prisoners have frequently 
brought tears from the eyes of the lat¬ 
ter And when reports of violations of 
the rules of civilized warfare reached 
the world from the scene of the conflict 
they are deeds of the Russians, not the 
Japs; of the Christian, not the pagan; 
of the white race, not the yellow.

Edom, with dyed garments from Boz- 
rah, traveling ill the greatness of His 
strength, give to you greater victories 
on your onward march toward the 
pearly gates. The millennium is fast 
approaching when the mountains of sin 
shall be pawed into cinders and God’s 
Militant Church shall go sweeping 
thtough the gates and as we go, let the 
words of the poet give us cheer: 

“1: may not be on the mountain’s height 
or stormy sea, 

It may not be at the battle’s front my 
Lord will have need of me, 

But, if by a still small voice He calls to 
paths that I do not know, 

I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in 
thine, 

I will go where you want me to go, 

I will say what you want me to say, 
And I’ll be what you want me to be.” 

Brethren, I pray God’s blessing upon 
you, and all the agencies employed by 
you in furthering and developing your 
blessed Zion. May the stirring anthems 
of our own Charles Wesley which have 
soothed and cheeered the hearts of mill¬ 
ions, and the burning sermons of the 
immortal John Wesley roll on and ever 
anon in one mighty volume of praises, 
until love like a sweet nectar shall have 
sweetened every sinful ill of earth and 
joy of heaven kissed every hilltop, and 
peace like a flowing river, shall have 
belted the universe, and the earth be 
filled with the knowledge and love of 
God like the waters that cover the sea, 

“And when the war is over, 

With the saints forever more 
On the blissful heights of glory 
We’ll shout the battles o’er, 

And in the Golden City 
We will join the Conqueror, forever 
marching on. 


THE GENERAL SLOCUM DISAS¬ 
TER. 

The disaster in the New York harbor 
which resulted in the loss of 900 lives 
by the burning of the steamer Genera! 
Slocum is one of those catastrophes that 
seems impossible to avert. The matter 
is being rigidly investigated by tederal 
and city authorities. But how to pre¬ 
vent the recurrence of such catastrophes 
while great bodies of people are crazy 
about pleasure outings and are willing 
to pack themselves into theaters, rail¬ 
road trains and steamboats is a difficult 
problem. Although the loss of life by 
such accidents are becoming more fre¬ 
quent and more appalling the disposition' 
of the people to overcrowd theaters and 
excursions, thus making themselves pos¬ 
sible victims of horrors, continues un¬ 
abated. To sum the whole matter up it 
is the price the people are payrng for 
what they call pleasure. 


A Masterly Plea for Fair 
Play. 

By the Great Los Angeles Times. 

Gen. Otis Stands Fast. 

The Negro Must Prove Himself Worthy of 
Equal Rights and Privilege. 

WHAT THE NEGRO ASKS. 

Let the white man be just to the 
negro. The white man will not be just 
to himself unless he is just to the negro. 

In the midst of the loose' talk about 
“negro supremacy,” “negro domination,” 
“social equality” and all that sort of 
thing, it is well, perhaps, to stop and 
consider whether the negro is asking 
anything at the hands of the white man 
which is unreasonable. 

Looking at the matter calmly, reason¬ 
ably and without piiejudice—if those of 
us who have been long prejudiced can 
view the matter in so fair a light—it is 
difficult to perceive that anything un¬ 
reasonable has been asked on behalf of 
the negro. 

For himself, the negro is asking no 
special privileges not accorded to others; 
no special consideration of any kind. 
In fact, special consideration and special 
privileges are the very things which he 
does not desire. 

All that is asked by the negro, or by 
those who speak in his behalf v is the 
same treatment that is accorded . to 
other citizens. Only this and nothing 
more. 

Under the Constitution and the stat¬ 
utes, all men are equal before the law. 
This is the rock upon which our great 
and free government was founded. The 
utmost that the negro desires is that 
the conceded and obvious meaning of 
the Constitution and the statutes shall 
be upheld in practice. 

While the negro does not desire nor 
expect to be made the object of special 
privileges, he naturally objects—and he 
has both moral and a legal right to ob¬ 
ject—to the withholding from him of 
guaranteed rights on the soie ground 
that his skin happens to be some shades 
darker than that of his brothers of the 
Caucasian race. 

Is it unreasonble for the negro to ask 
that he shall be allowed to stand or fall 
solely on his merits? If he prove in¬ 
competent or untrustworthy as an indi¬ 
vidual, let him be judged by those 
shortcomings as other individuals are 
judged. But do not shut the door of 
opportunity in his face merely because 
the cuticle which incloses his flesh car¬ 
ries a pigment somewhat different from 
that found in the skins of other men. ^ 

Under the Constitution the negro is 
guaranteed the same civil rights as other 
citizens. He should be estimated by 
the same standards. If he is incom¬ 


petent to exercise the privileges of the 
franchise, let him be debarred there¬ 
from, so far as he is unworthy, by edu¬ 
cational and other restrictive qualifica¬ 
tions ; but let the laws be of general, not 
of special, application. Let them apply 
to white men as well as to black men. 

The vote of an ignorant negro is no 
worse than the vote of an ignorant 
white man. The vote of an intelligent 
negro is as valuable, and should be held 
as sacred, as the vote of an Intelligent 
white man. 

The negro is in this country to stay. 
He did not come here of his own accord. 
It is the consensus of intelligent opinion, 
even in the South, that he cannot be 
spared from that section if he were en¬ 
tirely willing to leave it, which he is not. 
The negro is as much a citizen of the 
United States as is any other man born 
under the flag we love. He is entitled 
to the same rights as other citizens. To 
deprive him of any of these rights is a 
gross injustice that cannot be success¬ 
fully defended nor permanently main¬ 
tained. It is unworthy of the race that 
claims for itself superiority. 

This injustice cannot forever endure 
in a nation where the people govern, be¬ 
cause the people are just in their ulti¬ 
mate conclusions, though they may seem¬ 
ingly consent to injustice and wrong for 
a time. 

As for the question of social equality, 
it could safely be left to adjust itself if 
the question of the negro’s citizenship 
rights were justly decided. No person 
is obliged to meet any other person in a 
social way against his will. The intelli¬ 
gent, refined negro is apt to be about as 
particular in his choice of association as 
the white man of similar attainment. 

To summarize the case in brief: The 
negro asks no more than simple justice. 
This he is clearly entitled to, and this 
he will eventually receive, if he has the 
patience to wait for it and the courage 
to win it. In the mean time it rests with 
the negro himself to prove that he is 
worthy of the equal rights and equal 
privileges that are demanded on his be¬ 
half.—Los Angeles Times.

ELOPED WITH A BURLY NEGRO. 

A Chicago white woman left her 
husband and child and took her coach¬ 
man, a burly negro, and left for parts 
unknown. The occurrence has been 
kept quiet by the press. The Southern 
press is suffering with quiet spasms.

THE LIBERATOR. 


AS LEADERS ARE THE NEGRO 
PREACHERS A FAILURE 

Some years ago Booker T. Washing¬ 
ton, the sage of Tttskegee, was credited 
with saying that the great body ot negro 
preachers were a detriment to their 
race. A study of the negro ministers 
of today reveais the same sad truth. We 
have contended all along that whatever 
the negro lacks of being what he ought 
to be is very largely if not wholly due 
to the bad leadership on the part of 
negro ministers. The race as a whole 
is absolutely in the hands of our minis¬ 
ters, the ministers very largely doing the 
thinking for it. From two to tour times 
each week they attend church and listen 
to the exhortation of the ministers, the 
ministers being the only men that can 
reach them from the platform, as they 
refuse to attend lectures other than 
those given by their preacher. What is 
true of the negro in this respect in the 
country at large is true of the negro In 
this city. He is absolutely in the hands 
of the preachers. The present chaotic 
condition of our people here shows that 
our local preachers either exercise no 
influence over their congregations or 
they do not lead them in the paths that 
lead to self-respect, unity and self-sup¬ 
port. Although we have four or five 
important churches in this city, all said 
to be churches of Jesus Christ and be¬ 
lievers in the teachings of the Great 
Teacher, there is absolutely no unity 
among them or fellowship looking to 
the common advancement of the race. 
Although seven-eighths of our popula¬ 
tion of six or seven thousand are mem¬ 
bers of the church, there is no organi¬ 
zation looking to. the care of our old 
folks, no hospitals for our sick and no 
asylum for our orphans. The trade of 
our race, amounting to many thousands 
annually, are distributed promiscuously 
with little or no thought of concentrat¬ 
ing it so as to benefit the race by open¬ 
ing to them opportunities for employ¬ 
ment. We have hundreds of thousands 
of dollars deposited in banks and build¬ 
ing and loan associations that not only 
do not give a single member of the race 
employment, but in many cases yield no 
income whatever. Every attempt to af¬ 
fect an organization to turn the negroe’s 
trade and the benefit accruing from his 
money into his own channels thereby 
enhancing his value as a citizen, sub¬ 
jects its originators to the slander, con¬ 
tumely, jealousy* and hatred of the non- 
progressive, unambitious negro who has 
absolutely no object in view, who lives 
only to eat and slander every decent, 
progressive member of the race who at¬ 
tempts to do something for the common 
good. Unfortunately for those who are 
willing to make sacrifices for the ad¬ 
vancement of the race, no matter how 
honest they may be, they never have the 
support of the ministers when attacked 
by the slanderers. The majority of the 
ministers are silent on such occasions. 
While we have some worthy ministers, 
the great majority of them are small, 


narrow and desperately selfish. They 
are interested only in making an easy 
job for themselves. With the bulk of 
them their individual church is the race, 
and such ministers are the church, and 
all energies expended in the advance¬ 
ment of the church is simply expended 
to keep the ministers in idleness. With 
the salaries our local ministers receive 
and the fact that they are the leaders 
ot the people they have plenty of time 
to read and think and devise ways for 
the unification and advancement of the 
race. But if the condition of our peo¬ 
ple is the index of their leadership they 
either have the poorest leaders on earth 
or no leaders at all. The wise leader 
who is dependent upon the people for 
his daily bread would readily see the im¬ 
portance of putting forth every effort 
that tended to increase the worth and 
material prosperity of his people, know¬ 
ing that the more, they possessed the 
better care they could take of him. But 
the average negro preacher seems to 
take the other view of it and encourages 
extravagance, picnics, concerts and every 
money-spending, time-killing thing that 
tends to keep the people from hand to 
mouth. If the members of the church 
who depend upon the preacher for ad¬ 
vice and information of all kinds were 
properly taught by them, instead of hav¬ 
ing a people that is united in nothing 
for their common good, who encourage 
no race enterprise as a body, who are 
unable to concentrate their energies for 
the advancement of any cause looking 
to the common good, whose religious 
influence serves only their individual 
churches, our entire church member¬ 
ship of all the churches would form one 
grand religious body whose influence for 
good would be felt everywhere. Such a 
body of people would concentrate their 
energies and means so as to furnish 
employment for their sons and daugh¬ 
ters, homes would be built for their 
aged, sick and orphans, race enterprises 
would be encouraged, homes and lands 
would be purchased and everything 
would be done to make the race self- 
supporting. The fact that our people 
stand for just the opposite is a reflec¬ 
tion upon their leaders, who are the 
preachers. In the language of the street, 
the negro preachers will have to get a 
move on themselves; they need more re¬ 
ligion and less selfishness. They want 
to be more manly and less truckling. To 
boil the matter down, the negro preacher 
ought to be a Christian; this would 
make him brave, honest, industrious, in¬ 
telligent, broad, progressive and un¬ 
selfish. It would make him strong 
enough to stand up and be counted hi 
every controversy between right and 
wrong; it would make him a positive 
man, a force in the affairs of his com¬ 
munity instead of a cipher. Such a 
leader, with a hundred followers, could 
make -any race enterprise in his com¬ 
munity a success. Such a leader could 
so concentrate the trade of his followers 
that opportunities for their development 
would everywhere be open. Until such 


a leader comes the negro and his re¬ 
ligion will be a byword. 


A DISGRACE TO THE NEGROES 
OF LOS ANGELES. 

There is no denying the fact that 
many of the colored delegates had the 
most difficult time to secure their meals 
during the General Conference just 
closed at Los Angeles that they have 
ever had. Very few of the restaurants 
or cafes kept by whites would enter¬ 
tain them, and the colored people them¬ 
selves hadn’t a single eating place that 
could be considered first class. Let us 
hope it may not always be so.— South- 
Western Christian Advocate . 

The fact that the above is true is a 
disgrace to the negroes of this city. 
Ii half of the money the negroes spend 
in building churches was spent in 
building first class hotels and places 
of business, the negroes would have 
more religion and would encounter less 
race prejudice. A race that has 
nothing but religion is generally greatly 
lacking in the genuine article, therefore 
cannot command the respect of people 
who have both religion and business. 
A people who spend all of their money 
foolishly, and depend upon someone 
else for employment, ought not to feel 
insulted when the people who employ 
them send them to the kitchen to eat. 
If the negroes here owned and oper¬ 
ated a first class hotel on the European 
plan, it would be patronized by re¬ 
spectable people of both races, and the 
hotels conducted by white people would 
deem it unnecessary to draw the color 
line. The man who has things of his 
own can always have the use of other 
people’s things. This thing of building 
fine churches to look at and shout in, 
and have no place to eat and sleep, 
seems to us to be attempting to climb 
the hill backwards. There is room and 
urgent need here for a first class hotel 
to be owned and conducted by colored 
men. The man or men who will seize 
the opportunity that is now going a 
begging will not only Hake a fortune 
foi themselves, but will raise the entire 
race in public estimation and confer 
upon it a lasting blessing. 


GOT $700,000. 

Hanna Elias, said to be a negro, got 
$7go,ooo from Millionaire John R. Platt 
for the privilege of basking in her 
smiles. The old man tried to get it 
back, but the negress, as she is called, 
threatened to squeal, and the matter 
was dropped. It was a little presump¬ 
tions on his part to ask the law to 
restore to him what he unlawfully 
squandered in licentiousness.
