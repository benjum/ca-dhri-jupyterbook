country, in the city the various mission¬ 
ary agencies will keep a school open for 
his children eight or nine months. Ill 
the country, as a rule, the school house 
is wretched ,the teacher poor, and the 
term lasts only three o five months. 

If for no other reason than these 
financial ones, it would pay those who 
Own the land in the South to see to it 
that a good school is kept open in every 
country district. A good school, in 
my opinion, would soon add fifty per 
cent to the price of farming lands, be¬ 
cause it would soon stop, in a large 
measure, the exodus of colored people 
to the cities. Another thing which 
sends a larger number of Negroes to 
the cities than many realize, is the 
surety of getting police protection in 
the city when one is charged with 
crime. I think I do not overstate the 
matter when I say that for every lynch¬ 
ing, or attempted lynching that takes 
place in the country, a score of colored 
people leave the vicinity for the city. 
This whole question is one that should 
receive very serious attention.

BOOKER T. WASHINGTON. 


Principal Washington’s report to the 
trustees of the Tuskegee Normal and 
Industrial Institute gives a fair, idea 
of the splendid work this institution 
is doing as well as its needs for the 
continuation of its great work in up¬ 
lifting the negroes. By reading his re¬ 
port it will be found that during the 
past twelve months the students manu¬ 
factured 2,990,00a brick, 1,367 garments 
were made, in the tailor shop, and 541,- 
837 pieces were laundered by the girls 
in the P undry division. 

The institution is still in need of 
morr*y to meet its current expenses, 
as the following statement shows: 
Income from Endowment Fund. .$40,000 

Students’ Entrance Fees . 4,500 

State Appropriation . 3,ooo

In concluding his report, Mr. Wash¬ 
ington makes some statements which 
we here append, that should have the 
serious consideration of all who are 
interested in the future wellbeing of 
the country. 

WHY NEGROES FLOCK TO THE 
CITIES. 

There are several influences, 'how¬ 
ever, that are constantly exerting them¬ 
selves against the Negro growing up 
on the soil at present. One of these 
is the lack of public school facilities 
in the country districts, and the frequent 
and unwise agitation oi the question 
of dividing the school fund in propor¬ 
tion to the taxes paid by each race. 
In the cities and larger towns, the Ne¬ 
gro parent finds a comfortable school 
house and a school in session eight or 
nine months, taught by a competent 
teacher. Moreover, the Negro knows 
tint if, perchance, he may be deprived 
of nearly all school facilities in the 


In an interview with a representa¬ 
tives of the Atlanta Constitution who 
was visiting Tuekegee Mr. Washington 
made same abversations concerning the 
aims and objects of Tuskegee, which 
we publish for the benefit of those who 
still need light on the subjects dis¬ 
cussed : 

THE SERVANT PROBLEM. 

“It is sometimes complained,” said 
I to Principal Washington, “that your 
students do not, as a rule, go into do¬ 
mestic service. I have heard it said 
that it is almost impossible to secure a 
good servant from your school.” 

“I think that is a fair statement, but 
not a fair criticism. This is not a ser¬ 
vant training school nor an employ¬ 
ment agency for the general public. That 
is a mistaken idea that the public has 
gratuitously taken up. The object of 
this school is to “train men and women 
who will go out to repeat -the work 
done here, to teach -what they have 
learned to others, and to leave the whole 
mass of the 

* * * * 

THE SCARCITY OF TRAINED 
SERVANTS. 

“How do you account for the unwil¬ 
lingness of these trained graduates to 
take the private service so generally de¬ 
sired by them?” 

“Well, they are never advised here 
not to take such service, especially not 
to refuse it in preference to idleness. 
But that involves only an ordinary 
economic principle. We find by expe¬ 
rience that capable industrial men and 
women of the colored race are like those 
of the white race—they seek the most 
profitable work. A blacksmith, brick- 
mason, harnessmaker or other artisan 
who can find work in shops or factories 
or independently, and make thirty to 
<eventy-five dollars per month, will not, 
because he is a negro, leave tnose

chances to accept service in private em¬ 
ployment, in any man's stable, or farm, 
or factor* for fifteen dollars per month 
and board himself. So, likewise, with 
our female graduates. If they can make 
twenty to fifty dollars per month in 
hotels ,millinery work, dressmaking, or 
other places wanting them at better fig¬ 
ures, they will not become house ser¬ 
vants at from ten to eighteen dollars 
per month. You see we cannot here 
coerce any of our 'Students to abandon 
the hope of becoming free workers, shop 
owners, or the wives and housekeepers 
of husbands able to sustain them out¬ 
side of household service for the gen¬ 
eral public. I doubt if any school can 
guarantee to train servants for lifetime 
tenure in menial employments.” 

ECONOMIC INCREMENT IN THE 
SOUTH. 

Asked as to his views of the efforts 
to limit the education of the negroes 
and cut down the chances of becoming 
a dangerous, because cheap, competitor 
with white labor, Principal Washing¬ 
ton replied: 

“Unless education is weakening to 
the principles of good citizenship it 
ought to be given freely and in practi¬ 
cal form to all who are expected to be 
efficient citizens. If it is a bad thing 
to be educated our school systems for 
all races should be abolished at once. 
Rut if education tames, trains and pro¬ 
fits the white citizen why will it ; not 
do the same for those colored citizens 
who are sensible enough to eagerly work 
for it? It seems to me that a vast econ¬ 
omic increment to the south is yet^ to 
be derived to properties and industries, 
by the right education of its negro 
population. Better workmen make bet¬ 
ter product and better profits. The ne¬ 
gro workman will not migrate from the 
south and all the results of his skill 
will remain here.” 

THE IMMENSE PLANT. 

The institution presents the^ appear¬ 
ance of a first-class modern village of 
some 1700 souls. It has been built al¬ 
most entirely by student labor and. that 
labor in the school today, given the raw 
material and time could build and equip 
a modern city without the aid of profes¬ 
sional labor from outside sources. 

Some of the buildings, as the Collis 
P. Hfuntington Memorial hall, now 
building, cost $50,000. The Carnegie 
library is one not surpassed anywhere 
for its cost, and was built an deqnipped 
by the students, except as to the chairs. 
The chapel is a magnificent edifice and 
seats 2400 persons. Rockefeller hall is 
a solendid building. The workshops are 
solidly housed and finely supplied with 
necessary practical machinery ,and ap¬ 
purtenances. 

The income from all sources this year 
is estimated at $7L933> and the exnenses 
at $155,000, leaving only $83,067 for 
which Phincipal Washington will have 
to get out among the philanthropists 
and touch them where they bulk the 


largest. The receipts last year were 
$192,049.21 and the current expenses 
were $152,135.20. The surplus .went into 
permanent improvements. Yet .all that 
Washington asks for this year, to cover 
the deficit between regular income and 
expenditures, is $83,067, plus $168,000 
for other urgently needed buildings and 
equipments. 

t The writer has seen the best, univer¬ 
sity plants of thirty-seven states in the 
union and can honestly declare that not 
half of them are so large and splendidly 
equipped for their work as is this mar¬ 
vellously Alladin-like educational set¬ 
tlement at Tuskegee. ’ 


NEGRO STUDENTS' WORK. 

Claremont, Nov. 18.—Winston M. C. 
Dickson, of the graduating class of Po¬ 
mona 'College, conducted last night's 
session ofthe Young Men’s Christian 
Association. In a forceful opening ad¬ 
dress he presented the subject, “Our 
Chief Faults.” With a graphic illus¬ 
tration from the Old Testament story 
he emphasized the fact that each college 
man has some “king to kill”—some no¬ 
table enemy of successful character build¬ 
ing. Dickson entered Pomona 'College 
in 1900; thus far he is the first negro 
student of the institution. Hie came from 
Texas, where he had taught sohool suc¬ 
cessfully for several years, and was at 
last given the directorship of the State 
Summer School. He determined to pre¬ 
pare himself for the legal profession, 
and came, upon recommendation, to Po¬ 
mona College to take his four years of 
collegiate work in preparation for his 
three-year law course. 

From the day he arrived he has earned 
every dollar of his way. As a scholar 
he has uniformly maintained one of the 
highest marks in his class of twenty- 
three members. In the annual Home 
Oratorical Contest in March, 1902, he 
first showed his forensic ability. In 
that contest he won a close second. He 
has served as president of the Pomona 
College Debating Club, and the Choral 
Union, and vice-president of the Inter¬ 
collegiate Oratorical Association. He is 
president of the Pomona College Lit¬ 
erary Society, and of the Temperance 
Oratorical League.—Los Angeles Times. 


NOTEWORTHY BANK OPENING. 

Richmond, Va., Nov. 2.—Maggie L. 
Walker, a representative colored woman, 
is president of the St. Luke's savings 
bank, which began business here today. 
As soon as the doors were thrown open 
depositors began to crowd in, bringing 
from $1 to many hundreds, and before 
the time came for closing the sum ag¬ 
gregated $75,000. The bank has a cap* 
ital of $50,000.

any kind. If you want to buy a home, 
I have j ust what you need and will make 
prices and terms to suit you. I can rent

Dr. T. J. Nelson, a recent graduate 
of the Cooper Medical College, of San 
Francisco, now occupies a suite of rooms 
in the Bryson block, corner Spring and 
Second streets. His rooms, 605-7, are 
things of beauty and are supplied with 
all modern medical and surgical appli¬ 
ances. The doctor is a bright young 
man and is well equipped for his chosen 
profession. He is well known and popu¬ 
lar in this citv, where he was reared. A 
bright future for him is certain. The 
doctor has a well selected library con¬ 
taining the works of the best medical 
authorities. 

Hiad No Regard for Her Word.—* 
Some days ago a white lady at her hus¬ 
band's request advertised for a colored 
girl for general housework. The adver¬ 
tisement was answered by a clean, bright 
looking colored girl who, after being 
shown over the house, expressed herself 
as satisfied with the work and wages to be 
received, she left and promised to return 
for work the next morning without fail. 
But she failed. The lady has not heard 
from her since. The failure of the girl 
to return as she promised to do caused 
the lady considerable needless worry and 
disappointment, as the girl knew wheth¬ 
er or not she was coming back and 
ought to have told the lady the truth. 
She would have been thought none the 
less of. If she did it intentionally she 
has started out on the wrong road and 
may do much injury to the honest young 
women of the race.

OUR TICKET FOR 1904. 

For President of the United States, 
Theodore Roosevelt, of New York. 
For Vice-President, 

Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, of California, 
or 

Governor Durbin, of Indiana, 


THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS 

show that the Amercan people are no 
more inclined to turn the country over 
to the democrats, than they were four 
years ago. The season of prosperity 
continues, the .power of the nation as a 
world power is increasing and the spirit 
of patriotism, the demand for equal 
rights, equal opportunity for all as, is 
advocated by the President, is being 
infused into our national life so that 
the trend of the nation is upward. 
Under such circumstances, the demo¬ 
cratic party, which persists in keepiing 
its brains, if it has any. in the rear, 
has no more )show than the traditional 
cat in hades without claws. If Mr. 
Roosevelt is the true exponent of his 
party, it has re-installed man in our 
national economy, to his place above 
the dollar. Under the captaincy of Till¬ 
man, Carmack, Gorman and Varda¬ 
nian of Mississippi, the democrats ship 
is doomed to continue drifting rudder- 


lessly about with no higher aim than 
that of attempting to unship the rudder 
of the republican ship or scuddling 
such of the weaker crafts as falls into 
its power. The great body of the 
American people are progressive, lib¬ 
erty loving, and inspite of their blund¬ 
ers by occassionally consorting with 
the Tillman element, they still lead the 
world in the march of human liberty. 
Because they stood silently by 
and allowed the mob under the lead¬ 
ership of Tillman, Vardanian and Car¬ 
mack to nullify the negro’s constitu¬ 
tional rights, they have not lost their 
sense of honor. The South asked for 
a chance to settle the race question in 
its own way, promising justice to all 
concerned. It was given a chance. 
After 28 years of absolute power in the 
matter the South admits its failure. It 
has disfranchised every negro within its 
borders in violation of the constitution 
and of its pledges and now brazenly 
comes forward with a request for the 
repeal of the fourteenth and fifteenth 
Amendments, so as to disfranchise the 
negroes of the north and west. This 
demand will be met as the attempt to 
spread human, slavery in the north was 
met. ^ The same fate awaits both. The 
President’s declaration that he will not 
close the door of hoped against the 
colored man on account of his color, will 
as Lincoln was sustained. The threat 
be sustained by the American people 
by Tillman, Gorman, and Carmack to 
make the “Race Problem” an issue in 
the next national campaign the Presi¬ 
dent met it in his characteristic way. 
He has thrown down the gage of bat¬ 
tle. He says ,in reply to their threat: 
“If I could be absolutely assured of my 
reelection ns President,” he declared, 
“by turning my back on human liberty 
as enunciated by Abraham Lincoln, I 
would be incapable of doing it, and un¬ 
fit to be President if I could be capable 
of it.” 

Replying to the criticisms which 
have been made relative to his attitude 
toward organized capital and organized 
labor, the President said, further: “I 
do not expect to be elected President 
by the trust promoters, who are fighting 
for special prvileges, nor by the radi¬ 
cal labor union men, who would shut 
out all other men from an opportunity 
to work, nor by those who would close 
the door of hope against the colored 
man as a citizen. They are all demand¬ 
ing special privileges which cannot be 
recognized by the President, whose 
oath of office binds him to execute the 
laws for all alike, and to recognize 
none as above the law.” 


MAJOR LOWE WENT LOW. 

The overwhelming defeat of Major 
Lowe for re-elecion as mayor of 
Greater New York, was not unexpected. 
With the support of every pulpit in 
the city and that of every influential pa¬ 
per, his defeat by such heavy odds was 


a source of much surprise. The result 
presents one stubborn fact: and that is 
that the church has practically lost its 
hold upon a very large body of Amer¬ 
ican voters. This is largely due to its 
inconsistency, its silent endorsement 
of many violations of the Golden Rule, 
because they had the backing of a 
vicious public sentiment. Tammany’'s 
great victory has caused wide spread 
lamentation for the woes that Greater 
New York, is to suffer as the result 
of Tammany’s success. The fact that a 
very large -majority of the voters of 
both New York and Brookln .preferred 
Tam any to Lowe seems to have been 
overlooked. The stampeed from Lowe 
was general and vigirously m earnest. 
The black troops left the Lowe camp 
in a body and their break served as a 
signal for the stampeed that followed. 
The “Lowe reform administration” 
cost nearly every colored office holder 
his job to make room for Mr. Lowe's 
white friends. When Tammany goes in. 
300 colored office holders will also go 
in. Since his association wth the whte 
people the negro is not adverse to 
office holding and frequently adopts 
the white man’s tactics to attain the 
object of his ambition. In local elec¬ 
tion the negro’s partisanship is rapid¬ 
ly disappearing. Upon this his politi¬ 
cal influence largely depends. 


THE OLD RAPE RACKET PLAY¬ 
ING OUT. 

The world “do move,” and Arkansas 
is in the van. Recently a negro was ac¬ 
quitted in that state for lack of evi¬ 
dence, on a charge of raping a white 
woman.—The Enterprise. 

Some weeks ago a white Kentucky 
belle, for some reason, charged the col¬ 
ored coachman with rape. The negro 
was promptly put in jail. But as the 
lynching habit had somewhat worn off 
and it began to look as if the negro was 
to have a jury trial, the belle in ques¬ 
tion called upon the negro's attorney 
and requested the return of some letters 
she had written the negro. This the 
lawyer refused to do, stating that they 
were to appear as evidence when the 
trial came off. She wept bitterly, and 
as her pleading proved of no avail, she 
ended it all by jumping into the river. 
This is one case in which a lynching 
bee would have hidden a multitude of 
sins. Truth will yet have a hearing. 


There is plenty of work and of iroom for 
honest, industrious colored men and wo¬ 
men who desire to better their condition 
here in Southern California. The de¬ 
mand for colored help cannot be sup¬ 
plied. Wages are good and the treat¬ 
ment given the negroes by the white 
people is kind and just. While the 
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe roads 
give low rates, bring your friends out.

NO COLOR LINE FOR THE UNI¬ 
VERSITY. 

The attempt of the Tillman, Varda- 
man, Carmack sentiment to draw the 
color at the University of Southern 
California, fry refusing Miss Watson 
add-mission into the Athena Literary 
Society, was turned down. The fact 
that such an attempt was made in a 
Christian institution like the Universi¬ 
ty, in this state and city, where the sen¬ 
timent for fair play is the prevailing 
one, shows how well the gospel of race 
hate is laying its foundation to supplant 
the gospel of Jesus Christ in this 
country. Whether this vicory is to be 
temporary. or lasting remains to- be 
seen. This color hate as it is seen in 
this country is slavery’s plan to im¬ 
pede the negro’s progress and is as 
relentless as hell, as arrogant as satan, 
has neither part nor lot in the Golden 
Rule, as blind' and dead to the sense 
of justice of honor as the corpse of 
Leon iCzoIgosz and as blasphemous 
as the Mormon church. To attempt to 
draw the color line at this late day in 
an institution supported by the great M. 
E. church, which has done, and is do¬ 
ing so much, for the spread of the gos¬ 
pel of peace and love, show that there 
are yet world's for this church to con¬ 
quer and slaves to liberate from the er¬ 
ror of their ways. The actions of the 
members of the Athena Literary Socie¬ 
ty, in turning down the color line agi¬ 
tators, reflects great credit upon -them, 
as well as upon the good progressive 
Christian people of the city. 

The action taken bv the society is right, 
and must finally prevail everywhere. The 
actions of the society puts the colored 
students upon their best behavior. They 
must by the exercise of those virtues 
which make ladies and gentlemen, prove 
themselves worthy of the struggle made 
for their admission. Those voting for 
the admission of Miss Watson, simply 
did their duty; it was all that they 
could consistently do. The society has 
done its duty and did it well. The col¬ 
ored boys and girls must ever bear in 
mind, that the mistakes of one is 
charged to them all, and that the wor¬ 
thy actions of members of the race are 
too often not placed to the credit side 
of its account. 


REMEMBER THEM. 

We feel it our. especial duty to again 
request our friends and readers, espe¬ 
cially the colored ones, to trade with 
those who arvertise in this journal. By 
so doing they not only confer' a favor 
upon us, but help themselves by helping 
thore who help race enterprises, By 
looking over the colored. papers pub¬ 
lished here, it will be readily seen that 
a very few of the business houses of 
the city patronize them. Those who ad¬ 
vertise in the colored papers do so to 
get our people’s trade, and it is the 
negro’s duty to see that they get it. 

Those who do not advertise in negro 


papers either don’t want the negro’s 
trade or think they can get it bv ignor¬ 
ing him and his enterprises. The col¬ 
ored population of the city will soon 
reach 10,000, the majority of whom 
are intelligent, progressive race loving 
people, whose attention we believe only 
needs to be called to this matter. THE 
NEGRO MUST MAKE IT A RULE 
TO TRADE ONLY WITH THOSE 
WHO ADVERTISE IN COLORED 
PAPERS, always giving the name of 
the paper in which he saw the adver¬ 
tisement The firm that discriminates 
AGAINST THE NEGRO WHEN 
LETTING OUT WORK, WILL 
BEAT HIM WHENEVER THE OP¬ 
PORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF. 
If our colored pulpits would take this 
matter up and enlighten the people upon 
it, they would not only prove an ele¬ 
ment of strength to the colored press, 
but would create hundreds of position 
for our church-going people. 


Under the title of “Remember Them,” 
some things are said that you ought 
to read. It contains some suggestions 
well worthy of your consideration. This 
is not the time to lose ground. It is 
either forward or backward, upward 
or downward.

favored locality.

Mr. J .H. Greer’s cottage, 1237 Ivy

tractive, containing all modern conven¬ 
iences. Gentlemen, you are on the right 
road. The ownership of a well-kept 
home is one of the safeguards of good 
citizenship. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

Remarkable Women.—While we have 
many young women in Los Angeles of 
whom we are justly proud, we have two 
whose success in their chosen fields 
reflect great credit upon the race as well 
as. upon themselves. These ladies are 
Misses Helen Warner and Lula J. Hol¬ 
den. When Miss Warner rented an 
office and hu-ng out her shingle as sten¬ 
ographer and typewriter, the future 
seemed to offer nothing but failure. It 
was at a time when there were more 
applicants than jobs, more typewriters’ 
type than copy to be typewritten. After 
she answered ads. for a typewriter, sev¬ 
eral times and was turned down on ac¬ 
count of 'her color, she thought fate 
was against her. and felt like giving 
up in despair. This was a mistake f it 
was one of fate’s wa^s of bringing out 
the best that was in her. Fortune de¬ 
cided that she must work for self, so 
she opened an office and advertised for 
work. Her profession was crowded, 
there were no members of her race who 
needed her services, her skin- was 
dark, that was the situation; with just 
money enough to pay her office rent, she 
secured a little work here and there, 
but the excellence of her work and the 
despatch with which it was done, 
brought more work and then plenty of 
work, and demonstrated to her satis¬ 
faction that the top was not crowded. 
She has an office in the Bullard block, 
and is placed among the heads of her 
profession. 

Miss Holden is a painter of excep¬ 
tional ability, being a graduate of the 
Los Angeles Art School. Her. studio 
contains many beautiful productions of 
her brush. Her talent is -being appre¬ 
ciated tin a substantial way by the sale 
of her excellent drawings. She is well 
endowed for her chosen field and will 
make a place for herself. These young 
ladies show what can be accomplished 
by those who dare and do, by those 
who have confidence in themselves. 


* * * . 

Rev. G. R. Bryant, pastor Wesley 
Chapel, M. E. Church, is meeting with 
abundant success. The services of the 
church are well attended, all seats being 
taken. He is putting on foot several 
reforms that will add to the strength 
of the church for good. The practice 
of. renting the church to the devil to 
raise money for God is to go. That 
old heathen custom of marching to the
