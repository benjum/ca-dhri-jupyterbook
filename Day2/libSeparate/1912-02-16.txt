PORTRAYED IN HISTORY AS ONE OF 
OUR GREATEST CITIZENS 


“The constitution knows no man 
by the color of his skin. The men 
who made it were too noble for 
any such limitations of humanity 
and human rights. The term 
^white‘ is a modern terra in the 
legislation of this country. It was 
never used in the better days of 
our republic, but has sprung up 
within the period of our national 
degeneracy.’’ 


REV. GORDON HEARD FROM 



\The Liberator's criticism of Rev. 
I Gordon’s Emancipation address was 
so extensively read and commented 
upon that he thinks a statement 
of his side of the case ought to be 
presented to our readers. The 
Liberator has no desire to harm 
anyone and its columns are always 
open to persons who believe 
themselves injured by statements 
published in them. 


's Emancipation address was 


open to persons who 


“I am, myself, not insensible 
to the many difficulties that beset 
us on every hand. They fling 
their broad and gloomy shadows 
across the pathway of every thought 
full colored man in this country. 
For one I see them clearly and 
feel them sadly. Standing, as it 
were, barefoot and treading upon 
the sharp and flinty rocks of the 
present and looking out upon the 
boundless sea of the future, I 
have sought in my humble way to

Did Pul! His Hat Oflf. 


Rev. Gordon says that while 
his stay in Liberia was not long 
enough to make a crop, he did 
pull off his hat and can produce 
a number of photos taken bare¬ 
headed with the natives of that 
country. These photos show Rev. 
Gordon standing surrounded by 
groups of admiring natives who 
looked upon his well grooiwed, 
manly form with enthusiastic 
delight. So this hat incident is 
closed.

Race Enterprises. 

As to race enterprises Rev. Gor¬ 
don exhibited a big bunch of receipt¬ 
ed bills showing that he patronized 
race enterprises of every kind. 
Having no regular place of business 
he purchased his supplies wherever 
the spirit moved him. One of 
these recipts shows that he gave 
a colored laundry man some work 
three years ago and his church 
members purchased him a suit 
from the colored Main street mer¬ 
chant tailor three years ago. 
This tailor is still in business at 
his old stand. In this connection 
Rev. Gordon says his money is 
his and that he proposes to do 
with it as he pleases. 


WESLEY CHAPEL NOTES 


The services were largely attend¬ 
ed last Sunday, Rev. Kenchin 
delivering a sermon of great spirit¬ 
ual power. 


A big audience turned out to 
hear the able address by Capt. 
Helm: “The Cross and Flag^’. 
Capt. Helm saw service in the 
naval battle in the Cuban waters 
which resulted in the destruction 
of the Spanish fleet. 


Master Kenchin the latest 
comer to Wesley is said to possess 
a strong voice. 


Mr, George and Theodore Bron¬ 
son are expected to visit their 
brother Lewis W. Bronson a pros¬ 
perous farmer of Kings County 
soon. 



REV. E. W. KENCHIN 


Rev. E. W. Kenchin who will 
address the Lyceum Sunday Feb. 
12th, 1912 4p. m. Subject: The 
Importance of Leadership, Wes¬ 
ley Chapel quoir will sing. Every¬ 
body cordially invited. 


THE LYCEUM 


The Lincoln-Douglass day at the 
Lyceum was attended by a repre¬ 
sentative audience owing to the 
numerous meetings held in various 
parts of the city the attendance 
was smaller than expected as the 
occasion was one that should have 
appealed to every colored citizen 
in the city. It has been truly 
said that the present century has 
produced but three great Negroes: 
Toussaint bOverture, the founder 
of a state, Bishop Allen the foun-der 
of a church and Frederick Douglass 
the founder of Negro citizenship. 
The linking together of the names 
of Lincoln and Douglass is a beau¬ 
tiful and appropriate combination, 
inseperably associating in the 
minds of men the names of two 
great orators, whose mutual 
friendship and personal contact 
redounded to the lasting good of 
the nation. Every young American 
regardless of race or color should 
read and study the lives of these two 


great orators and statesmen. No 
American citizen is educated who is 
ignorant of the life history of either 
Lincoln or Frederick Douglass. 

The addresses by Judge Dillon 
and Prof. Moore were both fine and 
consisted mainly of reminiscences. 
Prof. Moore entertainingly told 
of many thrilling incidents in the 
life of Douglass. Judge Dillon 
announced at the opening of his 
address that he would not make 
a speech but would talk to them 
as a teacher to his class. And in 
a soft conversational tone, delivered 
the most inspiring address ever 
heard at the Lyceum. He told 
the story of the lives of Lincoln 
and Douglass as they sympatheti¬ 
cally touched each or in a manner 
so intensely entertaining that the 
audience sat as. if transfixed. 

To colored audiences Judge Dil¬ 
lon is the most popular and best 
known public speakers in the city. 
Those who failed to hear him 
last Sunday sustained a great loss. 

Rev. E. F. Henderson the vice- 
president, recited Lincoln's favor¬ 
ite poem “Oh why should the 
spirits of mortals be proud?" 

America and the Battle Hymn 
of the Republic were sung by the 
audience led by Mrs. Prentice.

Clifton Phillips. Miss Phillips 
chose for her wedding gown a beau¬ 
tiful creation of white crepe de 
chene, over this fell a tulle veil 
caught up with orange blossoms 
and she carried a shower of brides 
roses. Miss Maggie Lewis aasist- 
ed as maid of honor and Miss 
Ophelia Jones was brides maid, 
both w aring dainty gowns of 
pink messaline with an iver drape 
of embroidered roses; each carrying 
a shower bouquet of pink carnations 
and ferns. Mr. Cleophus Bruce 
was best man, Mr. Ervin Lyde at¬ 
tendant. The bride stood under 
an arch of lilies and ferns from 
which hung a large white wedding 
bell. The decorations were in 
pink and white; !ittle baskets of 
pink sweet peas and asparagus 
plumossiis adorned the ceiling. 
The bride received many useful 
and very beautiful gifts from her 
many friends. Mr. and Mrs. 
Daniels will make their home with 
her aunt for the present, 1419 
Tennessee.

folks here, under the direction of 
Mrs. L. V. Stewart, are now re¬ 
hearsing the play in order to stage 
“Christophe” at one of the large 
theaters here, immediately after 
Easter Sunday. 


AFRO-AMERICAN COUNCIL 
FIGHTING OFFICERS OF THE 
LAW. 


The Afro-American Council is 
making a bitter fight upon officers 
Watson and White. These officers 
have been so vigorous in their 
pursuit of colored vags, that most 
of them have been forced to leave 
town or go to work. As a result 
crime among Negroes is less now 
than ever known. Somehow or 
other, the councils of late furnishes 
bonds and counsels for many of 
the vags arrested which is proving 
somewhat costly. If the council 
can get these officers off the force 
it could save this expense. 

To have its moneyless friends 
forced to go to work, leave town or 
board in jail, is a source of no small 
annoyance to the council. Several 
meetings have been held by the 
council of late to devise ways and 
means of disposing of these “blue 
coated hounds” as they are called. 
These colored officers have not 
only rendered great service to the 
city, but invaluable service to the 
Negroes by reducing opportunities 
to commit crimes

DOUGLASS ANNIVERSARY 


The 85th anniversary of the 
birth of Honorable Frederick 
Douglass will be celebrated at 
Wesley Chapel M. E. Church, 
Eighth and San Julian streets next 
Sunday evening 7:30 o’clock. 
This great event will be celebrated 
with appropriate exercises. Able 
speakers will address the audience 
and everything will be done to 
make the occasion a memorable 
one. 


THE BOARD OF SUPER¬ 
VISORS DRAW THE 
COLOR LINE 

And Use It as an Excuse to Keep 
Our Young Women from 
Getting Experience as 
Trained Nurses 

The weak statement b}^ certain 
members of the board of Super¬ 
visors that their refusal to admit 
Negro girls to the nurse training 
school at the county hospital was 
based upon the fear that the other 
nurses would desert their posts, 
is a base subterfuge. Why haven’t 
the white children left the public 
schools—^there are Negro children 
in them? The presence of young 
Negro men and women in the high 
schools and colleges of this city 
both public and private has caused 
no trouble—not a school has been 
broken up. The appointment of 
Negroes in the fire and police de¬ 
partments of the city has in no 
way impaired their efficiency. 

When Mayor Snyder several 
years ago recommended Negroes 
for the fire department he was in¬ 
formed that the other men in the 
department would not work with 
Negroes, the mayor simply stated 
that Negroes appointed to the fire 
department were fire men and that 
fire men who did not want to work 
Avith fire men could retire. That 
settled the matter. Mayor Synder 
took the same manly position in 
the appointment of policemen. 

Contrast these departments with 
the nurse training school at the 
county hospital and you get an 
idea of the size of the side steppers 
Avho constitute the majority of 
the supervisors. 

The pretended fear that certain 
nurses would resign if Negro girls 
were admitted, is the creation of 
the imagination of the members 
of the board used as an excuse 
to avoid giving the Negroes a 
square deal, when the pucilani- 
mous actions of the Board of 
Supervisors are contrasted with 
those of the County Recorder 
and the present city clerk who 
is a democrat, their cowardly, 
unmanly position is apparent. 

One of the regular clerks in the 


County Recorder’s office is a colored 
woman. The city clerk’s appoint¬ 
ees are limited to extras only, 
but among them were three Negroes. 
When it was hinted to him that the 
other extras would quit if the 
Negroes were put to work said: 
Allright, if they quit it would make 
places for others who were beseig- 
ing him on every hand. 

But why discuss the matter fur¬ 
ther. There will be a number of 
big, capable, broad minded men 
aspiring for the office, making it 
an easy matter to defeat at the 
primaries every guilty member who 
desires to succeed himself. C. J. 
Nellis was the only man that stood 
up for fair play; McCabe kept 
under cover; the other three voted 
against fair play. Don't forget 
them. 


A FEDERAL LAW AGAINST 
LYNCHING 


The agitation in the east to 
have Congress enact laws against 
lynching is very timely. This 
demand for the protection of Ameri¬ 
can citizens against mob violence 
at home as well as abroad is one 
that should have the support of 
puplit and press of the entire coun¬ 
try. Lynching is not a sectional 
but a national disease—a disgrace 
to the age. A nation like an in¬ 
dividual its duty to fulfill its 
pledges in order that it may main- 
rain its own self-respect as Avell as 
that of others. An individual who 
makes promises with no thought 
of keeping them or who knows that 
he cannot keep them will make for 
himself a low moral standing. A 
nation is a collection of individuals 
bound by the same moral laws.
