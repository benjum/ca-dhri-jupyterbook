EDITOR EDMONDS VISITS 
FRESNO. 


Spends Two Days Among the 
Farmers in That Vicinity. 
Prosperity’s Smile, Seen 
Everywhere. 


Leaving the Arcade station at 
9 :20 a. m. on Sept. 27, daylight of 
the 28th found us gliding down 
from the summit of the Tehachapi 
mountains. Following a serpen¬ 
tine trail hewn in the side of the 
mountain, on the edge of dizzy 
precipices and over yawning 
chasm, our heavy train rolling 
down at a lively clip from cliff to 
cliff, let us down in the San Joa¬ 
quin valley just as the morning 
sun lit up the mountain gorges 
with a flood of golden light. Pass¬ 
ing the prosperous cities of Bak¬ 
ersfield, Tulare, Kingsbury, Sel¬ 
ma, Fowler and Malaga, we ar¬ 
rived at Fresno about 11 o’clock 
and by a streak of good fortune we 
secured board and lodging with 
Mrs. L. A. Jones, who conduct- 
a first class boarding holtse at 1503 
Tuolumne street. 

After luncheon we attended the 
afternoon session of the annual 
conference, where we had the 
honor to meet Bishop Hughes and 
a number of leading ministers of 
the California Conference. In the 
meantime we met Rev. J. W. Price 
of the A. M. E. church, who spared 
no pains to make our stay pleas¬ 
ant. It was due to his kindness 
that we met so many of the wide 
awake business men and farmers 
in that bustling locality. We were 
certainly glad to find so many col¬ 
ored men engaged in business. 

Mr. M. E. Brooks is successful¬ 
ly conducting an up-to-date gro¬ 
cery business at 1118 B street. Fie 
enjoys a liberal race patronage 
which is largely due to his busi¬ 
ness-like methods. Besides being 
well read, Mr. Brooks has enjoyed 
extensive travel and possesses a 
knowledge of men and affairs that 

can be gained in no other way. 

# * * 

Mr. T. H. Southern a Los An¬ 
geles boy contractor and build¬ 


er, has all the work he can do. 
Having just completed an $1800 
cottage for a colored lady, he was 
drawing the plans for a $1350 cot¬ 
tage when we visited his office. 
He had contracts for the erection 
of five cottages at the time of our 
call. He says the valley is full of 
opportunities for young men who 
are willing to come up and take 

advantage of them. 

* * * 

Mr. Harry C. Weeks, proprietor 
of 4 ‘City Shoeing Shop,” is doing 
a prosperous business. He owns 
his building and ground. 

t ♦ • 

Mr. John Cannon conducts a 
dressed chicken market and is do¬ 
ing a paying business. 

Mrs. Jones, who conducts the 
boarding house of which we have 
spoken, buys her groceries from 
Mr. Brooks, her dressed chickens 
from Mr. Cannon, and has her 
laundry done at the colored laun¬ 
dry. 

♦ ♦ 

Rev. J. Mills conducts a steam 
laundry. He enjoys a large pat¬ 
ronage and gives employment to a 

large number of colored girls. 

* ♦ * 

As in this city the great majori¬ 
ty of our people own their homes, 
so it is in Fresno. Among the 
property owners that we had the 
good fortune to ir*:et, were 
Messrs. G. W atkins, Sam Schav- 
ers. E. T. Meacham, Rev. Morgan. 
L. B. Guess, Wm. Johnson, C. 
Chance aiuf Mrs. Bonaparte. Be¬ 
sides their homes the parties men 
tioned own many buildings, lots, 
improved and unimproved. \Ve 
had the pleasure of a short call at 
the residence of Mrs. Sam Schav 
ers. They have a neat six-room 
cottage with neat well kept 
grounds. Mrs. Schaver has an in¬ 
telligent interesting family of six 
girls, all of whom are in school ex¬ 
cept the older who is a high 
school graduate and a young wo¬ 
man of promise. 

Being a farmer by choice and 
a newspaper man by v/ay of fill¬ 
ing a vacancy, we were really a 


little out of place, till we got out 
among the farmers. At Fowler 
and Bowles we found them in all 
their glory, living easy, making 
money and educating their chil¬ 
dren. Tickling their own soil, it 
laughs with a golden harvest, sup¬ 
plying all their needs with some to 
spare. So plenty like early morn¬ 
ing hours of a flower crowned 
June day, spreads its mantle of joy 
over everything, giving strength 
to the aged and buoyancy to 
youth. Such are the happy condi¬ 
tions obtaining among the colored 
and other farmers around Fowler 
Bowles, Monmouth and Cane jo. 
Farmers at H. C. Smith Canejo: 
a stock farm of 2150 acres. At 
Monmouth, C. E. Orr, 100 acres; 
J. E. Abernathy, 60; C. M. Sut¬ 
ton, 20 ; Green Saphe, 20 ; Dr. 
Lowe, 40. At Fowler, 1. M. 
Young, 30 acres; J. Young, 20 ; R. 
Wysinger, 15; Mrs. Reeves, 5. At 
Bowles, Wm. Askew 20 acres, W. 
W. Eason. 20; P. A. Fotson, 20; 
C. W. Pilkinton & Son. 22: W. 
S. Pilkinton; 20; Wm. Defoor. 40; 
Mr. Campbell, 20; C. D. Defoor. 
20; Wm. Boatman, 20; Wm. Phil¬ 
lips, 20; A. G. McClenden, 20; 
Mr. Smith, 20; Emmet King, 20; 
G. W at kins, 10, and C. H. Nelson 
20 . 

The above mentioned farms are 
improved and self-supporting. 
When the fact that land here pro¬ 
duces crops worth $75 to $200 per 
acre and even more, one can get 
some idea of the income of the. 
fanners in that valley. Most of 
these farmers commenced by buy¬ 
ing town, lots on which cottages 
were erected. After these were 
paid for, they invested the money 
earned by working for white farm¬ 
ers, in farm lands and in this way 
laid the foundation for permanent 
prosperity. 

In order to increase their.profits 
the colored farmers have organ¬ 
ized a warehouse association. The 
object being to build a warehouse 
and pack their own raisins and 
fruit. This will, furnish employ¬ 
ment for the young people they 
are educating.

Allensworth we learned by dili¬ 
gent inquiry that the farmers there 
are doing well and the success of 
the colony is assured. An $8000 
warehouse has been built there re¬ 
cently which furnishes considera¬ 
ble employment to the settlers. 

Colored men and women who 
desire to buy homes and become 
independent can find opportuni¬ 
ties in abundance in the San Joa¬ 
quin valley. 


NO “BACK TO AFRICA” FOR 
THESE. 

Milton W. Lewis of the firm 
of Mitchell & Lewis (colored), 
who have offices in room 401, San 
Fernando building, reports that 
the month of September has been 
one of the banner months for this 
firm, which has been established 
over five years. 

“We have sold,” said Mr. 
Lewis, “fourteen houses and eight 
vacant lots to our people in the 
past month, ranging in prices 
from $800 to $5000, several of 
whom have paid half cash and 
others satisfactory payments, in 
various locations in our city. 
While in most cases our clients 
are among our own race, we have 
no difficulty in placing good buys 
and bargains with others. Our 
motto is NO MISREPRESEN¬ 
TATION, dealing rightly by all, 
regardless of nationality. Con¬ 
sequently we are succeeding. 

“The ‘back-to-Africa' cry has 
been started by some narrow¬ 
minded, religious enthusiasts, as 
well as urged on. by some would- 
be political leaders who have 
sought honors for which they 
were not entitled to. Many of 
my race's clergy are not good 
leaders or directors in the com¬ 
mercial and industrial world. 
Their conception is clouded. The 
politician of the old school is be¬ 
hind these times. The young ne¬ 
gro today who cannot brush away 
the few obstacles in the pathway 
of advancement and attain the 
place for which he is fitted, who 
has not purpose, preparation and 
patience, deserves to fall. Today 
more than at any time in the 


world's history will reward follow 
honesty, perseverance and use¬ 
fulness. These virtues will pry 
open all doors in this country, to 
all men, regardless of race or 
creed. 

“Among the bankers that this 
city and all of Southern California 
will entertain in the next few days 
will be a negro, Mr. John J. 
Mitchell, Jr., of Richmond, Va. 
He has risen by his own exertion 
as a business associate with the 
leading and best men of America. 
He is a living example of what a 
worthy, useful member of our 
race can do. Our people in Los 
Angeles and in all California, here 
in this land of opportunity, are 
gradually getting what they de¬ 
serve, and because of the better 
being taught through the press 
and the pulpit. The worthy of my 
race will be recognized more and 
more, not only here hut all 
throughout this land of ours, 
which doubtless is the land of the 
free and the home of the brave. 

“No back to Africa to the awak¬ 
ened, thoughtful, industrious, eco- 
interpretation of the right as is 
nomical men and women of our 
race.”—Los Angeles Herald.

While we do not agree with all 
Mr. Lewis says about the preach¬ 
ers, his article contains many true 
statements. We have the honor to 
know the ministers interested in 
this African missionary project 
and believe them to be imbued 
with the loftiest motives. 

If, however, there was a small 
exodus of preachers from sonne of 
the colored pulpits to positions of 
ox-driving, the race would be 
greatly benefited. Ed. 

Mr. Eugene Walker Takes Bank¬ 
er Mitchell on an Automobile 

Sight Seeing Tour. 

On Saturday evening after 
Banker Mitchell returned from 
Long Beach where he with the 
bankers' association had spent 
the day as the guest of that city. 
Mr. Eugene Walker, our mer¬ 
chant tailor, took him for an auto¬ 
mobile tour of this city. Rev. J 


T. Hill, Dr. T. J. Nelson and the 
editor of this journal had the 
honor and pleasure of accom¬ 
panying them. The West Lake 
district with its palatial homes 
was traversed. After visiting the 
magnificent residences of Gen. 
Otis of the Times, Editor E. T. 
Earl of the Express and Mrs. 
Judge Ross, the party wa« 
whisked to the home and match¬ 
less terrace gardens of R. A. 
Marsh. Only $50,000 homes can 
be built in that tract. The mil¬ 
lionaire colony of West Adams 
was next visited. The kingly 
mansions of the Child's, the Gug¬ 
genheim and Hook's were passed. 
After passing through St. 
James Park, that beauty spot, 
that only a master can describe, 
a trip through Chinatown 
was made after Mr. Mitchell and 
Rev. Hill were driven to the pa¬ 
latial home of Mr. and Mrs. R. C. 
Owens, where a dinner was serv¬ 
ed that eclipsed any the banker 
had received this side of the Rock¬ 
ies. Messrs. Walker and Owens 
have the thanks of the entire com¬ 
munity for the hospitality shown 
Mr. Mitchell. 


Firing Across the Color Line. 

Southern Colonel—“Say Rastus, 
where does Colonel Tram well 
live?” 

Colored Man—“Boss, how did 
you know my name was Rastus?” 

Southern Colonel—“I just 
guessed it.” 

Colored Man—“Then you guess 
where Colonel Tramwell lives, 
sir.” 

• * * 

Just after the close of the Civil 
War, a wealthy white farmer 
while walking around his farm 
met one of his former slaves driv¬ 
ing a nice horse and buggy which 
he, the colored man, owned. 

“Good morning, John,” said the 
farmer, “good morning old mar- 
ster,” replied the ex-slave. “I see 
you are riding in a buggy now. 
Why, that's more than [ can do,” 
said the planter. “Yes, you see ! 
works, and you don’t” replied the 
black man.

A DASTARDLY OUTRAGE. 

The blowing* up of the Times 
plant and slaughtering more than 
twenty employees was a dastardly 
outrage; Like the every day 
lynching of which it was a cow¬ 
ardly type, it ought to bring a 
blush of shame to the cheeks of 
every American. • Aside from the 
destruction of property in the 
Times horror, the cold blooded 
murder of twenty or more Ameri¬ 
can citizens is of so common oc¬ 
currence that it attracts no atten¬ 
tion unless, as in the present out¬ 
rage the victims happen to be 
white! That the cowardly, blood¬ 
curdling holocaust, is the direct 
result of tolerating cowardly bru¬ 
tal lynching of negroes in this 
country, no honest sane man will 
deny. The publication of the bru¬ 
tal southern lynchings by the 
daily papers under complimentary 
headlines, in all their ghastly de¬ 


tail have diseased the public mind 
to such extent, that respect for hu¬ 
man life has been lost. A senti¬ 
ment that allows lawless white 
men to kill all negroes that fail 
into their disfavor, is only prepar¬ 
ing the way for the murder of 
white men, who are so unfortunate 
as to secure the dislike of the same 
class. This sentiment is respon¬ 
sible for the roasting alive of the 
Times employees, and the destruc¬ 
tion of a million dollars worth of 
property and the world-wide ad¬ 
vertising of this city as an unsafe 
place to .live. Think of it. Gen. 
Otis, one of the first citizens of 
this state, a heavy taxpayer and 
one of the states greatest captains 
of industry, owing his life to the 
fact that he was not in his own 
building at 1 o’clock on the night 
of Oct. 1. Imagine the horror of 
roasting that honorable grand old 
man alive! And that, too, in his 
own building. Owing to his age, 
had he been in his editorial room 
on that ill fated night he could 
never have escaped. How thank¬ 
ful is this community that his life 
has been preserved. 

The blood of those innocent vic¬ 
tims of the Times horror is re¬ 
quired at the hands of every news¬ 
paper man whose paper has in¬ 
dorsed mob violence by either 
complimentary headlines, or fail¬ 
ure to denounce mobs as murder¬ 
ers. God will require it at the 
hands of every white minuter of 
the gospel who has failed to de¬ 
nounce mob violence from his pul¬ 
pit. Every failure to denounce 
mob murderers and burnings at 
the stake was an endorsement. 
Only a few weeks ago, a mol) at 
Palestine, Texas, murdered 25 to 
30 negroes and left their bodies 
to rot on the highways and in 
their cabins. Men charged with 
no crime, using the statement of 
the sheriff of the county, “were 
mercilessly shot to death as they 
fled through field and forest.” Men 
were ruthlessly shot to death in 
their cabins in the presence of 
their horror-stricken wives and 
children. Old gray haired men 
with only a few days to live were 


murdered when found trying to 
care for their dead—victims of the 
mob of the previous day. 

Without aid, without sympathy, 
without redress, the widows and 
orphans made so by that Texas 
mob are left to make their way in 
this cold world as best they may. 
And yet, that outrage has not 
been denounced by a single big 
daily paper or by a single white 
minister. And the pity of it is, 
that such crimes can be committed 
in a country that boasts of its 
Christianity under civil laws. 


NOT GOING TO AFRICA 

The colored people of Los An¬ 
geles have started an agitation on 
the subject of going back to Afri¬ 
ca. Sunday afternoon in the col¬ 
ored Baptist church there was a 
large and enthusiastic meeting in 
which the speakers, the Rev. J. D. 
Gordon and the Rev. J. T. Hill ad¬ 
vocated the return to their father- 
land of the colored people now in 
the United States. We hope that 
Bro. J. L. Edmonds, the gifted 
journalist and scholar who makes 
his residence in our midst, with his 
talented and meritorious family, 
won’t get the fever.—Saw telle 
Sentinel. 

No danger Brother. While we 
are in synijpath}' with the mission¬ 
ary spirit that is behind these gen¬ 
tlemen’s movement, we will spend 
our energies in doing missionary 
work in this mob-ridden country 
of ours. 

We, however, highly appreciate 
the kindly sentiments expressed 
by the Sentinel. From the best 
data in our possession it has been 
fully 200 years since our ancestors 
left Africa, so have lost tract of 
whatever right or title to any 
property they may have held. No, 
we are an American of Americans, 
and feel a patriotic pride in our 
country. There are millions of ne¬ 
groes in this country that are go¬ 
ing to stay here and the work of 
their uplift is so urgent that we 
can not desert them now.

BANKER MITCHELL 
ADDRESSES 


A Great Mass Meeting. 

The big audience that greeted 
the Hon. John Mitchell, Jr., pres¬ 
ident of the Mechanics Savings 
bank of Richmond, Va. } would 
have clone credit to any man. The 
large auditorium and gallery were 
packed and aisles along the walls 
and rear, being lined with eager 
men, women and boys who could 
not find seats. It was a great 
audience made up of the men and 
women who move the world 
qlong. The men avIio follow the 
plow, the merchant, doctors, law¬ 
yers, ministers of the gospel, 
newspaper men, washer women, 
hodcarriers, porters, janitors, 
street cleaners; sewer diggers, 
bootblacks and working men and 
women of every department of 
labor were represented 1 in full 
force. It was an inspiring audi¬ 
ence, representing as if did the 
great hive of human workers that 
gives the world whatever comfort 
it has. It was essentially the 
working people’s tribute to one 
of their members, a working 
mjan, who by incessant toil for 
the uplift of his fellows, has lifted 
himself to a place in their confi¬ 
dence where he is a cause of in¬ 
spiration to the men and women 
for whom, and with whom he is 
laboring. 

Mr. Mitchells speech lasting 
more than two hours was the 
most inspiring, the most practical 
we ever listened to. We have 
heard Booker T. Washington 
and many other noted colored or¬ 
ators, but none have so impressed 
us. The great audience was ab¬ 
solutely his from the opening to 
the close. 

He dominated everybody and 
every thing; the audience being 
swept along like a gale from wild 
enthusiasm to a death like clam. 
Pessimism and despair gave way 
to hope and a determination to 
“labor and to wait.” Every word 
uttered by the speaker was worth 
a golden dollar to the men and 


women who heard them and will 
make for the good of those who 
were absent. That Mitchell han¬ 
dled his audience like clay in the 
hands of a potter, was due to the 
fact that, that audience had be¬ 
fore it, a man that had done some¬ 
thing worth whilea man who 
had demonstrated what the race 
can do, and where the race can 
lift itself by persistent honorable 
effort. A man who by his own 
efforts had made himself a mem¬ 
ber of the greatest financial body, 
under the sun and by his manly 
deportment has won the respect 
and confidence of his exalted fel¬ 
low members. Sucn a man can 
get the attention of any audience; 
such a man can inspire to nobler 
endeavor any people. John Mitch¬ 
ell, Great Virginian, stay with 
them. 


Mitchell Banqueted 

The ovation tendered Hon. 
John Mitchell, Jr., by the citizens 
of this city and vicinity would 
have done honor to any man. The 
banquet tendered him by the 
Business Men’s League eclipsed 
anything ever given in the city. 
The large gymnasium of the col¬ 
ored Y. M. C. A. was converted 
into a banqueting hall; the white 
walls were so completely hidden 
by American Hags, inat no part 
of them could he seen. The folds 
of old glory dominated every¬ 
thing. Fhe long tables were dec¬ 
orated by rows of potted palms, 
running through the centers. 
Leaning against the palms were 
photographs of the interior of the 
different departments of the Me¬ 
chanics’ Savings Bank of Rich¬ 
mond. of which Mr. Mitchell is 
president. Photographs of the 
bank building and its hoard of 
directors were a part of the wall 
decorations. At 8 o’clock the 
committee in charge found that 
the number of persons wishing 
scats were greater than had been 
provided for. The efficient cater- 
ess. Airs. Clithal was equal 
to the occasion. Tables were set 


in the lobby and the whole ground 
floor was occupied by the ban¬ 
queters. 

Air. Fred Roberts, president of 
the Los Angeles Business Alen’s 
League, acted as master of cere¬ 
monies. Divine blessing was in¬ 
voked by Lieut. Col. Allensworth. 
After the address by the master 
of ceremonies Col. Allensworth 
was introduced and delivered a 
short, spicy address. The editor 
of this paper responded for the L. 
A. Press. Air. Milton W. Lewis 
of the real estate firm of Alitchell 
& Lewis, responded for the Busi¬ 
ness men in a splendid address. 
Air. Eugene Walker, the mer¬ 
chant tailor, and Rev. J. T. Hill 
gave their time to the guest of 
honor, so did not respond. 

Mr. Mitchell’s address consist¬ 
ed mainly of reminiscence of his 
newspaper career. His detailing 
of many dangers, toil and snares 
through which had already come, 
held his audience spell-bound for 
more than an hour. Mr. Alitchell 
said that at the time of his con¬ 
version which took place many 
years ago, he lost all fear of death 
which he accounts for some of 
the "foolhardy” things, as lie puts 
it, that he lias done in defense of 
the race. He especially urged the 
male members of his audience to 
cultivate moral and physical cour¬ 
age. During the delivery of his 
speech, Mr, Alitchell attempted 
several times to conclude but 
yielded to cries of “go on, go on” 
from a hundred throats. 

Among the business and pro¬ 
fessional men seated around the 
banquet tables were J. Edwin 
Hill, editor of the New Age, 
Lieut. Col. Allensworth, Rev. J. 
T. Hill, Eugene Walker, Harry 
Mitchell, W. S. Lacy, Milton W,

pend on for its moral material and 
intellectual advancement. It was 
a magnificent tribute to a king of 
men, by that class of our people 
that has made possible the race's 
splendid achievements. The whole 
affair was fittingly graced by the 
presence of many ladies becoming¬ 
ly gowned. 


WHITE SAVAGES 


Burn a Negro at the Stake 

These brutal white savages of 
the South have broken loose again 
by burning a negro convict at the 
stake on the “old rape charge.” It 
is impossible to read the press 
dispatches concerning the brutal 
affair, without discovering that 
there is something rotten about 
it. In the South a thousand white 
savages will trump up a charge 
against a poor defenseless negro, 
chain him to a stake and sit 
around and laugh and jeer while 
he slowly burns to death. In the 
North the same class actuated by 
the same motives, blew up a 
white newspaper plant and roast¬ 
ed the white employes alive. 
White men who practice brutality 
upon negroes soon became brutal 
by nature and then gratify their 
brutal instincts upon white men. 
The negroes are not discouraged 
and are not going to be. They 
know that every burning of a ne¬ 
gro at the stake is simply another 
proof that white men are losing 
out in the game of civilization. 
What has become of the white 
man's boasted superiority? Our 
advice to the negroes, is: Send 
your children to school, make 
God-fearing law-abiding men and 
women of them. Have them cul¬ 
tivate habits of industry, so¬ 
briety and frugality. Teach them 
how to use fire arms and be loyal 
to our country. Teach them that 
a dead brave man is worth a thou¬ 
sand living cowards; that a man 
who is afraid to die, lives only a 
dog's life. 

While the white men are mak¬ 
ing criminals, let ns make men; 


while thev are developing the 
baser sentiments of the heart, let 
us develop the nobler; while they 
are mobbing and burning negroes, 
and blowing up newspaper plants, 
let us buy homes, build churches 
and schools. The white men of 
this country are sowing to the 
wind. It seems as if they have 
forgotten God. We are not un¬ 
mindful of the fact that there are, 
in this country, vastly more good 
white men than bad ones; but the 
thing that is everlastingly dis¬ 
gracing the American people in 
the eyes of the civilized world, is 
(he fact that the good white men 
allow the criminal classes to com¬ 
mit anyr crimes again si negroes 
unrestrained. 

That white men are now becom¬ 
ing victims should surprise no 
one. 

GUEST OF THE LEAGUE 

Hon. John Mitchell, Jr., editor 
of the Richmond Planet and 
president of the Mechanic? Sav¬ 
ings bank and only colored mem¬ 
ber of the National Bankers' as 
sociation, is the guest of the Col¬ 
ored Business Men’s League of 
this city. He comes to attend the 
national convention of that body. 
A committee from the Business 
Men’s League composed of the 
following gentlemen, G. W. 
Snell, W. S. Lacy, Eugene Walk¬ 
er, Editor Hill and J. L. Ed¬ 
monds, Editor of Liberator, met 
Mr. Mitchell with an automobile 
at the Arcade station where he 
arrived on the Golden State Lim¬ 
ited at 3:30 o’clock the 2nd inst. 
He was driven directly to the Y. 
M. C. A. building where he was 
billed to deliver a.i address. He 
was greeted by a large audience 
that had been waiting for two 
hours. In spite of his long jour¬ 
ney he delivered a miasterly ad¬ 
dress after which an impromptu 
reception was held giving the peo¬ 
ple opportunity to meet Mr. 
Mitchell personally. The occa¬ 
sion had the appearance of a 
Booker Washington visit. 

The League domiciled Mr. 
Mitchell at the Y. M. C. A. so that 


all members of the race could feel 
free to call upon him. 

Mr. Mitchell expressed himself 
as highly pleased with his loca¬ 
tion and surroundings.

Dear Sir: 

Received the two copies of The 
Liberator, contents noted. 

Being interested in the welfare 
of my people and willing to help 
whereever I can, I send $1 for the 
good cause your paper represents. 

I enjoyed the papers very 
much and feel it will help to pass 
away the lonesomeness of the 
cold winter days. 

We arrived home safely, and 
found work awaiting us. Sister 
is filling a vacancy as matron ; 
she has 73 little Indian boys to 
care for. 

We are short five employes, 
three teachers, one matron and a 
baker. So tell the young people 
of California there is work if the}' 
will put forth an effort to find it. 

Wishing you much success with 
your paper. 

I am sincerely, 

MISS ALLIE BARNETT, 
Nurse.

Attorney C. S. Dardin and Mr. 
W. S. Lacey can not be too high¬ 
ly comlmended for me efficient 
manner with which they handled 
the banquet. Mrs. Clitherall, the 
efficient cateress, did herself 
proud. Mrs. Clitherall’s banquets 
are always first-class. We com¬ 
mend her to the public generally. 


Mobs have been petted and ca¬ 
joled to such an extent that a 
white millionaire’s rife is as un¬ 
safe in Los Angeles as a negroe’s 
is, in Mississippi or Texas.

A BANQUET TENDERED 
REV. J. T. HILL. 

The banquet tendered Rev. Hill 
by the Mount Zion Baptist church 
of which he is pastor, was a swell 
affair. It was tendered him in 
honor of the close of the second 
year of his pastorate. The large 
church which has been remodeled 
and beautified since Kev. Hill be¬ 
came its pastor was filled with 
members and friends. Nearly all 
of the city pastors and many busi¬ 
ness and professional men were 
present and a number of appro¬ 
priate addresses were delivered. 

The membership presented him 
with a fine broadcloth suit and 
five dollars to purchase a hat. Dr. 
Hill is a Virginian of whom Los 
Angeles is proud. The banquet 
tendered him was a tribute to a 
high-toned, broad-minded public 

spirited Christian gentleman.
