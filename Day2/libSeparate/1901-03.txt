A NECESSARY EVIL. 


In the far-away sunny south (it was 
many years ago) I was standing in 
front of a saloon listening to some 
gentlemen who were discussing the 
advisability of driving all unchaste 
women out of the village. The village 
blacksmith, after listening to all the 
arguments, pro and econ, closed the 
debate with a strong little speech op- 
posing the proposition, coneluding his 
remarks with the statement that the 
presence of such women was a “neces- 


sary evil.” 
I was surprised at the position 
taken by the blacksmith: _ first, 


because he was the proud possessor of 
an interesting family of boys and girls, 
and second, because he had not only 
served the village in the useful capacity 
of blacksmith, but had served it as 
law maker, having been a member of 
the legislature. 

{i was a young man then, and 
J was as unacquainted with 
the ways of the world as I was with 
the wickedness of the saloon. The vil- 
lage was one of those whose inhabi- 
tants were born, got married, lived and 
died surrounded by those who Knew 
and loved them best. To its older in- 
habitants society as it came in later 
days was an enigma. 

But society came with its fads 
and vices with its endless 
rounds of socials, late suppers and 
inevitable sccial evil that always fol- 
lows in its wake; hence, the presence 
of unfortunate, though undesirable 
woman in this hitherto model village. 
With a strong desire to make a place 
for myself among men, I left the little 
community that had been all the world 
to me and found a home among strang- 
ers. I soon discovered that the world 
was much bigger than I thought if 
was and learned many things that I 
didn’t know there were to learn. 

At home Iwas a boy, but among 
strangers I was a man. Here my early 
training on the farm served me a good 
turn. The enforeed habits of industry 
and economy required on the farm in

my boyhood days were now nuggets of 
gold. 

The sweetest memories of my child- 
hood are those which clustered around 
my weekly visits to the village Sunday 
school and church. “The sound of 
the church-going bell that summoned 
me along with other villagers to Sun- 
day school, when life knew not care, 
now called me away from cares to that 
place where one may find absolute 
rest—the church. 

To be able during one’s life 
to lay down the burdens _inci- 
dental to the struggle for a success- 
ful existence is a boon worthy to be 
sought for, and yet it may be found 
every week by visiting the church and 
taking part in divine services. Indeed, 
if there is such a thing in all the 
world as absolute rest the church is 
the only place where it can be found. 
The habit of attending 
Sunday school acquired in the days 
of my youth did not forsake me now, 
when far away from home facing the 
stern things of life, but brought me 
in contact with the best people and 
soon opened to me the homes of the 
refined, giving me the benefits one .de- 
rives from pure association. But time 
rolled noiselessly on, bearing us all 
onward towards eternity like an irre- 
sistable wave. Many of my friends, 
both old and young, it wafted to the 
farther shore; others it scattered far 
and wide, leaving no trace behind 
them. 

After an absence of many years 
I visited the dear old town, “the o'd 
homestead,” and “found no one there 
to greet me at the door.” Those of my 
old school mates who met me were 
few and were strangers now, for I 
could only remember them as they were 
when J left them years before. And 
they knew me not, for, although time 
had been kind to me, with his hoary 
hand he had touched my head and 
filled my hair with silver threads. 
Many of the boys with whom I had 
played in the village, joined by the 
dear girls they first loved, were win- 
ning laurels in wider fields.

Of the old villagers thaf re: 
mained, some fortune had favored; 
upon others it had not smiled. 
Some had arisen, others had fallen; 
some had gone forward, others had 
gone backward; none had stood still. 
But the village blacksmith, whose 
giant frame, loving face and gentle 
speech that had made him my ideal of 
noble manhood, was decrepit and alone. 
He was hobbling toward the grave 
beneath a weight of cares much heavier 
than his many years. His wife, dear 
old lady, she was dead years ago, and 
his life seemed now a long, long star- 
less night, never to be brightened by a 
morning. His sons, the staff upon 
which he had hoped to lean in his de- 
clining years, following his footsteps 
by visiting saloons, had chosen down- 
ward careers and their histories were 
found in the records of the criminal 
courts. But his girls, those beautiful 
girls, ence the pride of the village; one 
of them had been fortunate—she was 
in her grave. The other two, where 
were they? They were living in that 


village as ‘necessary evils.”

THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE. 





From whence those notes of music that 
my senses greet 

Like strains of an aeolian harp, so ten- 

der and so sweet; 

summer winds are sighing 

through wildwoods green, 

When the day is dying and stara above 
are seen, 

What are those sounds so thrilling, for 
which my soul doth tong, 

So full of joy and harmony? It’s the 
nightingale’s sweet song. 


When 


\ 

Like softly murmuring waters of a 
moonlit sea, 

Breaking on a tropic shore—so full of 
melody, 

Like play of crystal fountains, or 
song of mountain streams, 

It fills my days with joy and nights 
with sweetest dreams. 

Oh, sing thy witching notes to me; oh, 
sing them o’er and o’er; 

Until my pulses fail me; oh, sing for- 

evermore.

NOW WEDS A NEGRO GIRL. 





Marriage of John Forbes, Whose 
Brother Lighted Fred Alexan- 
der’s Funeral Pile. 


Leavenworth, Kas., Feb. 26.—John 
W. Forbes, brothe: of William 4G. 
Forbes, who applied the match to the 
pile that burned to death the negro, 
Fred Alexander, a short time ago, 
married Tennessee Holt, a negro girl, 
here Thursday. The license was is- 
sued Monday. 

It was the niece of the groom, Pearl 
Forbes, who was found murdered one 
morning. For this crime, as well as 
several others, Alexander was burned 
atthe stake. John W. Forbes did not 
aid in the burning. He arrived in 
Leavenworth on a visit to his brother 
a few days after Alexander was cap- 
tured. 

Forbes, the groom, lives at Asher- 
ville, Tenn., where he owns a farm of 
160 acres of land and other property. 
He is 65 years old, while his negro wife 
is 24. She is said to own a farm, in- 
herited from her parents, not far from 
the one owned by her husband. At 
present Mrs. Forbes is here with negro 
elatives. Her husbund left town yes- 
terday for a few days to visit rela- 
tives in another part of the state. It 
is said they will make their home in 
Tennessee.—Kansas City Star. 

Well, this takes the cake. One 
brother burns a poor negro and the 
other eyens up by marrying one. The 
white people are making war on the 
negro from every quarter. Those they 
don’t kill they threaten to absorb. The 
negro is doomed.

LYNCHERS MAY SUFFER. 


Militia Ordered Out to Protect Wit- 
nesses and Officials in the Trial of 
Accused, Misgigsippi Men. 

MOBILE, Ala., March 4.—The facts 
of the lynching of Daniel Knox at 
Scranton, Miss., last week came out 
last I'riday at the trials of two men 
who have been arrested for accomplish- 
ing his death, and a sensational turn 
is expected. Three companies of the 
state militia have been ordered to the 
scene to protect witnesses and offi- 
cials. 

The widow of Knox, who is in this 
city, claims that her husband was in-

nocent of any intention to kill his step- 
son, and that he was hanged by the 
mob without a shadow of justice. She 
has appealed to the British consul 
here, A. S. Benn, for an inquiry into 
the death of her husband, who was a 
Canadian, and it is understood that 
representations have been made to 
Washington concerning the _ case. 
Wholesale arrests are expected when 
the militia arrives, to support the 
authorities.

VIRTUAL NEGRO SLAVERY. 





Horrible Condition of Affairs in Ander- 
son County, S. C.—The Grand Jury’s 
Report Expected Thursday. 
COLUMBIA, 8. C.,Mareh 4.—Unusual 

revelations are expected Thursday 

when the grand jury of Anderson 
county reports to a special sitting of 
the court upon the jnvestigation or- 
dered February 15 by Judge Bennett. 

The following alleged facts will be 

brought to the attention of the court: 

- That in the convict penitentiaries in 

Anderson county were found negroes 

guiltless of any greater crime than re- 

fusing to comply with labor contracts 
which demanded absolute slavery. 

These contracts should not have been 

lawful, and the negroes, though never 

taken before a magistrate, were by. 
physical force kept in bondage and 
made to work as felons. The contracts 
signed by these ignorant negroes were 
negotiable paper. A land owner having 

a negro bound to him fora year’s work 

eould sell his contract to a third party. 
The attention of the court was di- 

rected to this matter by evidence in 
the trial of Charles Newell, a planter 
whose farms are worked by convicts. 
Newel was charged with murder, hav- 
ing shot. Will Hull, a negro, trying to 
escape from his stockade when it was 
shown that the negro had never been 
convicted of a crime before a magis- 
trate or judge.

A WHITE MAN TORTURED. 


—_- —- 


At Matawan, N. J., February 25th, 
a white man suspected of arson was 
taken out by a mob of his white fellow 
citizens and twice hanged to force him 
to confess. His torture, cruel as if, 
was, was much more humane than that 
adopted in case of negroes suspected 
of crime. Several cases came under our 
own observation; in one case red hot 
irons were applied to the victim's 
feet and kept there until he confessed, 
but not until his feet were nearly 
burned off. The scenes of torture that 


followed his confession must 
have made all hell wild with 
horror. Another poor fellow, who 


was not suspected of crime, but was 
asked to implicate one of his friends 
in a murder case, as the mob was in 
need of evidence,and although he knew 
nothing of the matter, nameless por- 
tions of his body were screwed up in a 
vice and the pressure Was increased 
till death relieved the innocent sufferer. 
In the first case the coroner's jury was 
selected from the mob; in the latter 
investigation was ‘considered an unnec- 
essary expense on the county. We 
personally knew several other similar 
cases, but it is unnecessary to give 
them here; it will do no good; they 
are dead and their troubles are over. 
But the white man’s troubles are just 
commencing. The end is not yet. 





o 


SHE FULLY IDENTIFIED HIM. 





The ease with which white women 
ean identify negroes arrested on sSuS- 
picion of raping them was strikingly 
demonstrated in the case of Dock Reed, 
who was charged with assaulting Miss 
Dorothy Darter at Irvington, Ind., a 
few days ago. Reed was “fully iden- 
teified” by the girl and would have 
been burned with a slow fire had it 
not been for the presence of the militia 
with orders to shoot if necessary to pro- 
teet the prisoner. Where else on earth 


does such a condition of lawiessness 
exist? The only thing that saved Reed 


from a horrible death at the stake was 
his nearness to the state capital. Surely 
the outlook for the negro is dark; his 
condition is pitiable in the extreme. 
Unless there is a change, and there is 
no likelihood of one, trial by jury in 
the case of the negro will be unknown.

Of the numecus oil companies oper- 
ating in Southern California few, if 
any, are making better progress than 
the Juanita. Many of the directors 
are personally known to us, and are 
reliable, successful business men. We 
have known Mr. B. A. Stephens, the 
president, for a long time. He is a 
man of wide experience in matters of 
oil and oil lands and the company owes 
much to his judgment for many of 
their valuable holdings. The company 
now owns some of the best oil and 
asphalt lands in the state. These lands 
are being developed under Mr. Ste- 
phen’s personal management and 
promises large returns to the fortunate 
stockholders. The company owns in 
fee simple valuable real estate in San 
Diego and Riverside counties, besides 
leaseholds in Santa Barbara and 
San Luis Obispo counties. This 
makes Juanita stock valuable be- 
eause it represents something. The 
company is pledged to put the net 
profits of its wells into dividends up- 
on subscribed stock, thus giving inves- 
tors early returns on their money. Its 
seventeen lots in Summerland are right 
in the midst of oil producing lands. 
The company invites the closest inves- 
tigation. What we have said in this 
connection is without the knowledge of 
the company and is said simply in the 
interest of our readers who are inter- 
ested in oil companies. 





If every negro lynched will take a 
lyncher with him, the white women 
would soon put a stop to lynch law. 
That’s about the negro’s only. hope.

THE PRESIDENT’S INAUGURAL 


ADDRESS. 


Is an able document from the stand- 
point of concise, clear English. In the 


use of good English it is in keeping 
with his former state papers. On the 
question of lynching he ,is more con- 
sistent than he was four years ago. 
Then he said: ‘“‘Lynching must be 
stopped.”’ Now he suits his words to 
his actions—says nothing. Six months 
ago he and his campaign managers 
were very solicitous about the _ dis- 
franchisement of the negroes in North 
Carolina and other southern states; 
now they, through the Republican con- 
gress, have put themselves on record 
for non-interference. This is certainly 
consistent with his efforts to disfran- 
chise the negroes in Cuba, the dark 
skinned Hawaiians and Filipinos. He 
is laboring night and day and spend- 
ing millions of dollars and sacrificing 


THE LIBERATOR. 





thousands of lives to protect life and 
property in Cuba and the Philippines, 
but has nothing to say about the 
wholesale slaughter of American citi- 
zens by mobs in this country. During 
his last administration five American 
citizens were burned at the stake with 
slow fires and twice as many have 
been otherwise put to death by mobs 
than during any previous administra- 
tion; yet he makes no plea to the 
American people to protect life and 
property at home. There will be an 
end to all of this injustice and hypoc- 
racy.

accept a position with the Mullen & 
Bluett Clothing company. Mr. Brown 
has been in the employ of the railroad 
conipany ever since they commenced 
running cars between this city and 
Pasadena, and by his politeness and 
kind treatment of all, especially ladies 
and children, has made himself not 
only the best known, but the most 
popular conductor on the road. The 
patrons of the road will certainly re- 
gret to lose him. He was a_ special 
favorite with the children, who would 
cften wait half an hour to ride on his 
car. The Mullen & Bluett company 
is fortunate in securing the services of 
so popular a young man. We extend 
our best wishes to Mr. Brown and the 
firm.

THE MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGN IN 
PASADENA—THE COLORED VOT- 
ERS DIVIDED—THEY HOLD THE 
BALANCE OF POWER. 








The municipal contest now on in 
Pasadena promises to be the most 
spirited ever held in that clean, enter- 
prising city. There are to be two full 
tickets in the field, one headed«by Mar- 
shall Lacey, and the other by Mr. M. 
H. Weight, both are men of ability aud 
popularity. It goes without saying that 
that city will have good government, 
it matters not which ticket wins. The 
only question to be settled in the 
minds of the voters is which of the 
ecndidates is best fitted to give the city 
the most progressive administration? 
This will decide the contest. In the 
present, as in former contests, the 
white voters are almvust evenly di- 
vided, the colored voters holding the 
balance of power. The colored voters 
have also learned how to divide, but 
ihe division amcng them was never so 
great as in the present contest. The 
colored voters, while lining up for this 
or that candidate, should keep in mind 
their own interest and since the candi- 
dates are all clean men, should vote 
only for such of them as they believe 
will give the colored citizens the best 
show to earn some of the city’s money. 
If any of the candidates now running 
have made them promises in the past 
and failed to fulfill them after being 
elected, vote against them. A man 
who deceives you ought not to be 
trusted a second time, it makes no dif- 
ference what his position is. Have an 
understanding that the colored voters 
arc to be represented in the division 
of the spoils. The “purity of election” 
racket is worked only on the negro. 
“The T.mes,” which ought to be good 
authority, says in case of Republicans 
“that the jobs are all farmcd out evon 
before nominating conventions are 
held.’”?’ While voting for the best man, 
vote only for your friends. Self-inter- 


est first, is the white man’s motto.

NEARING THE END IN MISSISSIPPI 
WHITE MAN LYNCHED. 


SCRANTON, Miss., Feb. 28,—John 
Knox, a white man, was lynched here 
tonight for the murder of Don Davis. 

The fact that the white men of Mis- 
sissippi have commenced lynching 
each other shows the deadly effect of 
the lynching evil. Of course, it was 
only a poor white man and the story 
of his unlawful taking off could hardly 
find a place in the daily papers. But 
that doesn’t lessen the crime of his 
murderers. He was entitled to a trial 
by a jury of his peers; the United 
States constitution guaranteed him 
that. But a constitution that does not 
follow its flag is powerless to enforce 
its guaranties. 

Now that white men have com- 
menced to lynch each other, the be- 
ginning of the end has set in. Hither 
the Jaws will have to be enforced, irre- 
spective of race, color or conditions, 
or anarchy must ensue. 





CAPT. G. W. HAWKINS. 





Mr. Hawkins, the pioneer furniture 
dealer, is the best known and most pro- 


gressive colored business man in the 
city. He came here a few years ago 
from Texas, and instead of waiting for 
something to turn up he set to work 
and turned up something. He has 
had fitted up a large store at 233 East 
Second street, his old stand being too 
small. The captain owns a fine resi- 
dence on the corner of Sixteenth street 
and Central avenue, and is one of the

LOOKING BACK IN CHURCH. 





The following valuable papers were 
read at the Epworth League social 
given at“the Wesley M. E. Church on 
February 27th. Miss Kittie E. Bradley 
is head of the social department and is 
doing much good. Rev. Donohoo, the 
pastor, and his cultured wife are also 
doing a great work among the young 
people. 

Ts it the fault of the person entering? 

Yes; their attention is attracted by 
the noise people make coming up the 
steps, and their attention is also at- 
tracted by people peeping around the 
screen, especially the people that sit 
in the choir. We, as Epworth Leaguers, 
should set an example for these people 
that make a noise coming in church. 
When we come in church let us not 
peep around the sereen and make a 
noise coming up the steps, but let us 
go in and sit down, and respect the 
place of worship. 

Civility and good breeding are neccs- 
sary to success in life and if we wish 
to always be welcome in societies and 
religious meetings we should have 
these virtues, and also we should re- 
spect the house of worship too much 
to make a noise coming in. And 
just as a beautiful form and face at- 
tracts and conveys pleasure to the 
home, so elegant manners adorn and 
make agreeable the whole round of 
human life, whether it is in busincss, 
and especially in religious life.

Dear Freinds: My subject, “The 
Great Harm Done by Looking Back in 
Church,” is one that I feel can never be 
fully told. I know if there is any one 
that feels the great harm done by per- 
sons looking back in church it is the 
pastor. Imagine, if you can, how a 
preacher feels when he has studied 
prayed and worried over a sermon to 
deliver before the people, to have to 
hesitate every few moments to catch 
their attention. For during the whole 
service some one is coming in and go- 
ing out, and every time a person 
moves the least bit there are a great 
number of people that crane their 
necks to look back, and forget every- 
thing the preacher has said in their 
endeavor to look over their high ca!- 
lars to see who is coming in and going

out. There are many beautiful thoughts 
which are never uttered because, just 
as the preacher is about to say some- 
thing the door opens and everybody 
looks back. The preacher cannot help 
but see how disgusting it looks and 
thus loses his thought. -Looking back 
in church also has a bad 
effect on.the choir. When the door 
opens and everybody looks back then 
the attention of the choir is attracted. 
This continually repeated often does 
great harm to the singing. Then, to 
you, dear leaguer, think of the harm 
done yourself. Think of the times you 
have looked back and Jost all idea of 
what was being said. Perhaps you 
have lost several poiuts, and you from 
the one looking back, have grown dis- 
interested and will remain so through 
out the service. I know that all of us 
agree that it is a bad, a very bad and 
barmful habit. Then, if so, think of 
the terrible example you set every 
time you look back. Think of the num- 
ber of years there will be nothing but 
lookers-back in church if all follow 
your example. You are no privileged 
character. What you do, others may 
do. Think of the number of children 
that see you when you look back, and 
think of the terrible habit you are 
helping them to form. And you mothers 
know how much harder it is to get a 
child out of a bad habit than to get 
him into a good one. And to think cf 
the disgrace brought on in churches 
by looking back. Let us all take up 
ihe cross, and do all we can 
to make our church a model church;

Is it the fault of the audience look- 
ing back in church? 

Where did looking back in church 
come from? 

It came right out of the church. It 
was originated in the church; it is 
merely a habit of the people and is 
something that ought to be stopped. 
The behavior of all other audiences is 
taken from the audience of the church 
and we as followers of Christ trying 
to do what is right ought to be ex- 
amples for others, and have this rude 
behavior stopped. What weuld you 
think if you were to walk into a church 
being a stranger and every one turned 
and locked at you? I know you would 








feel like going out, for you would think 
you were not welcome. Let us use good 
behavior in the house of God; what- 
ever we do let us have these simple 
habits stopped, and then it will not be 
hard to stop the larger ones. 

It must be stopped, and we as Ep- 
worth Leaguers ought to and must 
have the house of God respecteu.
