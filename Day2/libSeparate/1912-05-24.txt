The Soil Draws no Color Line, and Neither 
Does the Rain, nor the Sun. 


Booker T. Washington Speaks to 
an Audience of 8,000 


Agriculture Offers Equal Chances 
to Black Men and White, and 
There is the Black’s Quick¬ 
est Way to Industrial 
Freedom 


A plea to Negroes to prefer 
country life to that of crowded 
cities was made by Booker T. 
Washington, head of the Tuske- 
gee Institute, before eight thousand 
persons—largely Negroes—in Con¬ 
vention Hall last night. The Ne¬ 
gro educator was speaking chiefly 
to the delegates of the African 
Methodist Episcopal conference, 
and he urged the church to lead 
its people “back to the soil/ 7 for, 
he said, “the soil draws no color 
line, and neither does the rain, 
nor the sun, but they grow suste¬ 
nance for the black man the same 
as for the white man and make 
him master of his little acres. 77 

Pointing to the big audience of 
intelligent looking Negroes, to the 
Methodist bishops seated behind 
him on the platform, to the choir 
of two hundred in the rear, and to 
the throng of ministers at his 
right, the speaker said: 

“I never was so proud of being 
a Negro as I am tonight. I would 
not trade places with a white man. 
I have searched the pages of his¬ 
tory and they do not tell of a race 
that has made such strides in civili¬ 
zation as the Negroes of the United 
States of America, now only forty- 
eight years out of slavery. 77 


“NEED THE WHITE MEN 77 

Doctor Washington saw a settle¬ 
ment of the so-called race problem 
in the new attitude of white men 
toward Negroes and of Negroes 
toward white men. “White men 
are beginning to talk more to us 
rather than about us. We are 
dependent upon the white man. 
He should be our teacher. As 
ministers of the Negro Church, 
you should invite white men into 
your pulpits. We need them. We 
must meet them face to face to 
solve the problem. 77 

Doctor Washington continued: 
OPPORTUNITY OF THE MINIS¬ 
TERS. 

“No class of individuals may 
exert more influence over the masses 
of Negroes throughout the United 
States than the Negro ministers. 
Each minister here has resting 
upon him a tremendous responsi¬ 
bility. 

“What can this body do to 
strengthen the millions of our 
people in this country, 82 per cent 
of whom live in the country dis¬ 
tricts or in small villages? All 
things considered, the Negro is 
at his best, body and soul, in the 
rural districts. He is usually at 
his worst in the city. Plainly 
one of the duties of your church is 
to help keep the Negro where he 
has the best chance. 77 

A feature of last night's meet¬ 
ing which brought priase, especially 
from the white part of the audience, 
was the singing of the excellent 
chorus choir of two hundred. An 
hour’s program of religious, classi¬ 
cal and Negro songs was given.

SOUTH CAROLINA LEADING IN 
CHURCH WORK FOR THE 
NEGROES 


A leader in many things, South 
Carolina announces its purpose to 
lead in still another thing. The 
Episcopal church of the whole 
country has debated for 20 years 
the question of supervision of 
church work by and for Negroes. 
In 1907 and again in 1910, in the 
church’s general conventions, the 
bishop Suffragan plan was discussed 
and adopted legally. This plan 
has been taken advantage of by 
New York, Philadelphia and Chic¬ 
ago. for larger supervision of work 
among all classes, white, black 
and foreign, but it was the Negro 
work that first suggested the idea 
of it. 

Now the Episcopal church in 
South Carolina, through its regu¬ 
lar white organization, determines 
to elect-a Negro bishop, the first 
in America. Bishop Guerry has 
secured funds, in part in the north, 
to maintain the new official for 
a term of years, but he has found, 
so he reports, that Episcopalians 
of South Carolina, the whites as 
well as the blacks are eager to 
contribute to this fund as far as 
able, and they were the first to 
do so. Indeed, so he states, South 
Carolina, and not the north, leads 
in making the innovation possible. 

The bishop Suffragan will be 
constructively under the white 
bishop, in order that there be not 
two Episcopalian churches in one 
diocese, but the Negroes will have 
their own annual council, and their 
bishop, when chosen, will be their 
own leader in practically all things.

THE LIBERATOR 


EDWARD SILVER THE MARTYR 


The news of Edward Silver's 
death was received by the colored 
people of Southern California with 
profound sorrow. Like martyrs 
before his time, he died in prison 
and found a grave in a prison 
cemetery, but the eternal principles 
for which they gave up their lives, 
have gone right on gathering added 
force for each sacrifice made in its 
defense. He died not in vain, for 
the struggle to save him from the 
gallows brought to the surface 
a number of strong but unknown 
young men and women and taught 
all, the- valuable lesson of how to 
labor unitedly in a common cause. 
Believing that Silver had acted 
in self-defense, a right guaranteed 
every citizen, they had prepared 
to keep up the fight for his life 
indefinitely. The destruction of 
the right of self-defense would spell 
the down fall of this nation. 

While it fell to our lot to take a 
prominent part in the fight for 
the maintenance of the American 
principle, no one rendered greater 
service than did Mr. J. Thomas 
Norris, who was, then, fortunately, 
president of the Forum. With a 
weaker or less intelligent man at 
the head of that organization, the 
case might have been lost for lack 
of funds, as there was at the start 
considerable opposition to taking 
any hand in the man's interest. 

There are some people, so con¬ 
structed, that they would let a 
man drown before they would assist a 
man to rescue him with whom they 
entertained a difference of opinion. 
There were the fainthearted, who 
lose hope if the fight is not won in 
the first round: those who believe 
that the weak are always wrong; 
and that big bunch who are always 
on the look out for the popular 
side. 

It was this aggregation that Mr. 
Norris had to care for and keep 
out of the way of the lion hearted. 
With a cool head and firm hand, 
he was equal to every emergency. 

In a fight like this, those who 
persist in saying: “there is no use," 
are always in evidence. Their 
banner is the signal of distress; 


placing their names high among the 
contributors but never give any¬ 
thing. 

But the people, who make good 
their promises, came forward with 
the cash whenever needed. A good 
woman, 70 years old, living in a 
rented house and working by the 
day, gave $2.50 and promised 
more, if needed. One man, whose 
name is with held for reasons, gave 
$5. The firm of Alexander & 
Bowman, $5. Mr. Nat Love, a 
laborer, $5 and the number con¬ 
tributing 25 cents to $1.00 
ran into hundreds. Mr. J. J. 
Jones, while contributing liberally, 
loaned $25 to assist in defraying 
Attorney Dardin’s expenses for 
his last visit to Sacramento, where 
he made the final plea, to the 
Supreme Court Judges which re¬ 
sulted in their letter to the Gover¬ 
nor which secured the commuta¬ 
tion of the death sentence. 

In their successful fight to save 
Silver from the gallows, the Negroes 
made no mistake. They maintain¬ 
ed the right of the Negro to defend 
himself against any one. The race 
is closer together by the struggle. 

Sheriff Ralphs, for protecting 
Silver against mob violence, has 
earned the lasting gratitude of 
the colored voters and citizens. 
Of course he did his duty, but how 
many men in his capacity do their 
duty when the news papers stir 
up the mob against a defenseless 
Negro? 

Although every intelligent per¬ 
son in San Bernardino County knew 
that Silver killed Smithson in self 
defense, Judge B. F. Bledsoe sen¬ 
tenced him to hang. Judges should 
not permit themselves to be used as 
an echo to the clamor of the law¬ 
less element that resorts to “lynch 
law" against the defenseless.

DEATH CLEARS THE 
CALENDAR 


San Bernardino Negro Released 
from Penalty 


Case Aroused Colored People 
Throughout the State 


SAN BERNARDINO, May 21. 

—Death has freed Ed. Silver, 
Negro slayer of Deputy Sheriff 
Will Smithson at Daggett, Silver 
was sentenced to hang by Judge 
B. F. Bledsoe, after pleading guilty 
to murder. The Negroes of the 
State were aroused over the court’s 
judgement, and employed a Negro 
attorney of Los Angeles, who car¬ 
ried the case to the Supreme Court, 
and secured a commutation of 
the sentence to life imprisonment. 

Silver offense was the act of a 
man driven to bay during the night 
by a man with whom he had been 
having trouble. The man called 
an officer, Smithson, and with him 
went searching for Silver. The 
latter thought it was a case of 
lynching. Smithson and other 
white men had revolvers drawn 
and Silver was the first to fire. 

Smithson was shot and died some 
hours afterward. Mob violence 
was worked up here, and under 
the fear of- being lynched, Silver 
pleaded guilty. Prior to the shoot¬ 
ing, he bore an unimpeachable 
reputation for honesty of peace 
and quiet.—L. A. Times. 


QUILT TACKING 


Thursday, May 16, the Booker 
T. Washington Art Club was en¬ 
tertained by Mrs. N. W. Cobb 
and Mrs. J. W. Payne at the latter’s 
residence on West 36th street. 

Old-fashioned quilt tacking was 
the chief resort of the evening. 

Light refreshments of salad, 
bread and butter sandwiches and 
ice tea were served. 

The club will be entertained at 
the residence of Mrs. Oliver of 
East Hollywood, Thursday, May 
23rd. 


FOOL’S PARADISE DEALING 
IN REAL ESTATE 


Last Sunday the Fool’s Paradise 
(Forum), went into the real estate 
business A bargain in the shape 
of 40 acres of land for sale at $30,- 
000 was handed in. Without a 
cent in sight or even a suggestion 
as to how to get one, a red hot 
discussion was engaged in, regard¬ 
ing the best manner of its subdi¬ 
vision, so that each would get 
his full share. Pleasure parks and 
eating houses sprang into being 
as quick and as noislessly as mush¬ 
rooms grow. The park trees were 
literally strung with sleeping ham¬ 
mocks, beneath which were hun¬ 
dreds of easy chairs. 

While these child-men were en- 
dulging in that mid-summer dream, 
the two promotors, who have the 
agency for the land, took part in 
the hot-air pumping process and 
seemed to think that they had 
actually sold the land. Yet, not 
a suggestion had been made or a 
plan'offered, by which to get the 
money to pay for the land upon 
which they were already building 
eating houses and swinging sleep¬ 
ing hammocks. 

To say that these men spent two 
full hours subdividing and parcel¬ 
ling out other people’s land with¬ 
out offering a single suggestion as 
to the means of raising the $30,000 
the price, is hard to believe, but 
it is true. 

People who are attracted to 
the place, out of curiosity, often, 
on leaving, ask: 

“What do those men meet there 
for?” 

The one answer is: the one man 
who runs it, has but one object 
and that is: that the people* who 
visit the place, shall leave behind 
them all hope of learning any¬ 
thing. 

The concern is run for the pro¬ 
motion of ignorance. The young 
people who visit the place are told 
that they are smarter than Du Bois 
or Booker T. Washington and the 
young things believe it. Of course, 
as long as they entertain such a 
dream, it will be impossible to 
learn anything farther. 


Such young people will not attend 
lectures, and will listen to nobody 
but themselves. 


BIG PICNIC 


The Elks will open their park, 
Seal Garden, with a big picnic on 
May 30th. Arrangements have 
been made to care for a big crowd 
and those desiring a pleasant out¬ 
ing should go to Seal Garden 
Park on that occasion. In leasing 
that park and opening it to mem¬ 
bers of the race the Elks have ren¬ 
dered them a valued service. Good 
order will be maintained. Ten 
minute car service. 

Presiding Elder King of Macon, 
Ga., delivered a splendid address 
at the Lyceum last Sunday. He 
urged our people to devote more 
time to business and less to having 
a good time. 

“Too much time is devoted to 
pleasure and not enough to things 
that are worth while,” he said. 

He especially urged the Negroes 
to buy farms in the country and 
become self-supporting instead of 
flocking to the cities where they 
find it much harder to succeed. 
His address was practical and whole¬ 
some.

A BROWNSVILLE APOLOGIST 


The attempt of a Negro, here 
and there, to apologize for Browns¬ 
ville, is exceedingly pathetic. 

One of these Brownsville apolo¬ 
gists, after trying in vain to get 
an audience of Negro voters to 
listen to a Roosevelt speech, finally 
succeeded in delivering it to a 
literary society composed of high 
school students. This speech was as 
humiliating to the race as it was 
printed in a sheet called the V—* 
W —, but known around town as 
the echo of dying hope. This 
was carried to the Roosevelt head¬ 
quarters where, perhaps, the money 


for its publication was obtained. 
It was there it had its biggest cir¬ 
culation, and its most numerous 
readers; for its promotors are so 
well known that there is hardly a 
sane person in town who would 
take the thing home or unwrap 
it if the post man brought it. 

The prevailing supposition is, 
that the publishers of these fake 
pre-convention and pre-election 
sheets, expect no one but their 
financial backers to read them— 
nobody else does. With the suck¬ 
er’s money, these fellows put on 
a bold front by running a number 
of free ads, knowing that the firms, 
whose ads they carry, will reap 
no benefit as the thing has no cir¬ 
culation. 

The candidate for office, who puts 
his card in such sheets, loses the 
vote of every voter who by chance 
sees it. People vote against such 
candidates on the ground that they 
either haven’t sense enough to 
fill the office, or, are trying to dodge 
their obligation, to certain citi¬ 
zens. 

The Negro, who wants to sup¬ 
port Col. Roosevelt or anyone else, 
has the right to do it. But—when 
it comes to apologizing for the 
Brownsville lynching, that crime 
of the century, if there is a spark 
of manhood left in the Negro he 
will draw the line there. The 
Negro who is around apologizing 
for Brownsville, is fooling no one 
but himself. Everybody knows 
what he is out for. 

Unworthy, tricky, office seekers 
and politicians will make use of 
such Negroes that they may close 
the door of hope to other Negroes 
after the election. 


K. P. CASE BEFORE SUPREME 
COURT 


Alton B. Parker, former presi¬ 
dential candidate, argued before 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States in the famous Georgia case 
of the Colored Order of Knights 
of Pythias. S. A. T. Watkins, 
assistant corporation counsel of 
Chicago, an Afro-American, is as¬ 
sociate attorney. 


Col. Roosevelt and the Negro 
Voters. 

Thus far in the present campaign, 
we have taken no part. While 
we have not agreed with all of 
the president’s official acts, we have 
never accorded with Col. Roose¬ 
velt’s attitude toward mob violence 
and his Brownsville outrage. After 
the national conventions have been 
held and the candidates named, 
we will then decide which can¬ 
didate we will support. 

Oh, no, the Col. did not give 
the Negro “a square deal” at 
Brownsville, and that act is with¬ 
out a parallel in the military annals 
of the civilized world. The Negro 
who apologizes for Brownsville, 
is unworthy to live in the same 
house with a Negro woman. 

Both the president and Col. 
Roosevelt are unpopular with the 
Negro voters and it is exceedingly 
doubtful whether or not those 
Negroes in the East who are sup¬ 
porting Col. Roosevelt now, will 
do so if he is nominated. The new 
slogan “beat Roosevelt at the 
primaries and Taft at the polls” 
may be reversed. 

The Negroes of the North and 
west are doing some thinking. 
Col. Roosevelt’s Brownsville, his 
position on lynching and his “re¬ 
call of judicial decisions” are full 
of danger to the Negro. 

We will support the candidate 
that we believe will do the most for 
the best interests of the country, 
and who shows that he has that 
quality of manhood that no race or 
part of our citizenship will be sacri¬ 
ficed.
