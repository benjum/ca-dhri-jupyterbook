THE AFRICAN METHODISTS 


The most compact and powerful 
of the Negro churches is the Afri¬ 
can Methodist Episcopal Church. 
Its membership has grown from 
42 members in 1787 to 200,000 
members in 1876 and 494,777 mem¬ 
bers in 1906. It is governed by 
a board of bishops, fifteen to eight¬ 
een in number, over whom the senior 
bishop, at present the Rt. Rev. 
Henry M. Turner presides. 

The church has 7,000 local or¬ 
ganizations, with property worth 
over $11,000,000. It raises about 
$2,000,000 a year; of this about 
$800,000 goes to pastors, $200,000 
to bishops and presiding elders, 
and the other million to schools, 
missions and general expenses. 

There are two publication houses, 
weekly papers and a quarterly 
magazine and some publication 
of books. The church supports 
over forty schools, of which the 
largest and oldest is Wilberforce 
University, in Ohio. 

The church, however, is chiefly 
noteworthy on account of its board 
of bishops. These bishops are 
elected for life by a general con¬ 
ference meeting every four years. 
The membership of the general 
conference consists of ministerial 
and lay delegates; the clerical 
delegates are elected from the 
annual conferences, one for every 
thirty ministers. Two lay dele¬ 
gates for each annual conference 
are selected by the representatives 
of the official church boards in 
the conference. Thus we have a 
peculiar case of Negro government, 
with elaborate machinery and the 
experience of a hundred years. 
How has it succeeded? Its finan¬ 
cial and numerical success has 


MAKE GREAT PROGRESS 

been remarkable, as has been shown. 
Moreover, the bishops elected form 
a remarkable series of personali¬ 
ties. Together the assembled bis¬ 
hops are perhaps the most strik¬ 
ing body of Negroes in the world 
in personal appearance: men of 
massive physique, clear-cut features 
and undoubted intelligence. 

The General Conference, which 
meets in Kansas City, Mo., May 
6-27, is a quadrennial meeting 
having the highest legislative and 
judicial authority. Meeting as 
seldom , as it does, it is necessarily 
a body of great importance. Its 
membership will be 522, consist¬ 
ing of the bishops, heads of general 
departments, presidents of colleges 
and ministerial and lay delegates 
representing American and Afri¬ 
can conferences. The revision of 
the discipline and the election of 
bishops and heads of departments 
will be the chief business of the 
session. 


ECONOMICS 


The colored Masons of Ala¬ 
bama report that $75,949, have 
been received during the year. 
The Odd Fellows of Luoisiana 
have paid $3,000 for a new building 
in New Orleans. The United 
Brothers of Friendship have erected 
a $20,000 building at Luoisville, 
Ky. This order collected in Texas 
during the year $67,459. The Ma¬ 
sons of Mississippi are reported 
to have spent $1,300,000 for endow¬ 
ment benefits, and have a balance 
of $19,000 on hanch The Odd 
Fellows of that State spent $507,000 
in two years, and have a balance 
of $78,000 on hand. 


In West Virginia the Republicans 
of Fayette County have since 1902 
given the colored people one re¬ 
presentative in the legislature. Two 
years ago the “Lily White” move¬ 
ment got rid of the colored member,, 
and the result was the Negroes 
threw their votes to the Indepen¬ 
dents and defeated the Republi¬ 
cans. This year a colored man 
seems likely to be nominated. 


WESLEY CHAPEL TELEGRAPHS 
THE GENERAL CONFERENCE 


To the General Conference of the 
M. E. Church. 

In care of the Bishop presiding. 
Greetings:— 

The matter as to whether we get 
a Negro Bishop or not is of very 
little concern to us, compared to 
the importance of article two hun¬ 
dred and sixty (260). There is 
no more reason for putting it under 
advices, because some folks do 
not observe it than that the ten 
commandments or the golden rule 
should be discarded for similar 
reason. 

The six hundred and fifty mem¬ 
bers of Wesley Chapel, emphati¬ 
cally protest against any move on 
the part of the church to back¬ 
slide on this thing. We most 
earnestly entreat you to save us 
from the great embarrassment 
which will follow any slackness 
with reference to these rules. 

In behalf of Wesley Chapel, 

E. W. Kenchin, 

Pastor.

THE LIBERATOR 


A BRAVE EX-UNION SOLDIER 
DIES IN PRISON FOR KILL¬ 
ING AN OFFICER IN 
SELF-DEFENSE 


STATE PRISON, SAN QUENTIN 
California 

May 6, 1912. 
Mr. J. L. Edmonds, 

Sawtelle, Cal. 

Dear Sir: 

Upon referring to our corres¬ 
pondence records, I find that you 
were, some time ago, in corres¬ 
pondence with convict No. 22500, 
Edward Silver, and I am, there¬ 
fore, led to believe that you will 
be interested in knowing that his 
death occurred here this morning 
from acute peritonitis. His remains 
will be buried in the prison cem¬ 
etery. 

Should you know of the address 
of any of his other friends or rela¬ 
tives, I would suggest that they 
will probably appreciate the favor 
if you will advise them of his death. 
Yours very truly, 

John E. Hoyle 
Warden. 


The above brief letter tells of 
the passing of as brave a man as 
ever breathed heaven’s pure air. 
That such a man is designated as 
“convict” is an indictment against 
the boasted spirit of fair play of 
which we hear so much and see 
so little. 

Edward Silver, an ex-union sol¬ 
dier was quietly working as a 
laborer at the borax works at 
Daggett, San Bernardinao Co., this 
state, on Oct. 19th, 1907. 

The foreman, a man of over¬ 
bearing disposition and who, per¬ 
haps, from unfortunate previous 
environment, looked upon colored 
men as having no rights that he 
was bound to respect, ordered 
Silver to change from “the night 
to the day shift.” 

“I don’t want to work on that 
shift, so you can give me my time,” 
said Silver. 

This offended the boss and he 
attempted to chastise Silver and 
“teach him his place.” 

The athletic training that Silver 
had received in the army came to 


his rescue and though refusing 
to strike his antagonist, he protected 
himself with such ease that his 
would-be chastiser grew frantic. 
Seizing a spade, he attempted to 
brain Silver; with ease Silver took 
the deadly tool and threw it 
away. The now desperate man 
made a dash for a magazine shot 
gun that he kept in the factory. 
Silver won the race to the gun and 
although not touching it himself, 
he did not allow the boss to touch 
it. 

Thoroughly beaten at his own 
game without being struck a blow, 
he did as his kind always do in 
such emergencies—went down¬ 
town and summoned help to “kill 
a bad nigger.” 

When [the would-be Negro baiter 
left the factory, Silver hurried to 
his cabin, put his automatic colts 
in his pocket and went two miles 
into the country. 

In the meantime, securing the 
aid of a friend and a deputy sheriff, 
with no warrant, but armed with 
four six shooters, the would-be 
Negro killer, made a desperate 
search of two hours after dark 
for Silver, visiting the home of 
every Negro in the town. 

Got What They Were Looking For 

Having searched the town in 
vain for trouble, they decided to 
way-lay and kill Silver when he 
returned to his cabin. 

Taking their places in a bend 
of the road, near Silver’s cabin, 
the bend in the road making it 
possible for Silver to walk into 
their misdt without seeing them. 
That was just what happened. 

Surrounding him, without say¬ 
ing a word, the deputy sheriff 
with partly drawn revolver stealth¬ 
ily approached him. When within 
a few feet of Silver the officer, 
who had the reputation of being a 
gun man, opened fire, only to find 
himself in deadly combat with a 
gunner from one of Uncle Sam’s 
black regimants. 

In less time than it takes to tell 
it, twenty shots had been fired, 
all four men taking part in the 
duel; one Negro against three 


white men. Before the officer had 
time to fall, four bullets had pierced 
his body above the heart all planted 
in a space like the palm of your 
hand. When the officer fell, his 
companions broke away with all 
speed leaving the wounded man 
to fate. The white men fired 
sixteen shots; Silver fired four. 

The other two men are living 
because Silver did not want to 
kill them; for with the two remain¬ 
ing cartridges in his revolver he 
could have easily killed both as 
they ran. 

Appeal to the Mob. 

With a bullet in his leg that he 
received in the fight Silver limped 
off toward San Bernardino to sur¬ 
render to the sheriff. 

In the meantime, morning papers 
of this city came out in flaming 
headlines and by willfully dis¬ 
torting the facts did everything 
possible to turn that county into 
a howling mob. They painted Silver 
such a vicious, blood-thirsty ani¬ 
mal that the mob kept out of his 
way. This enabled him to sur¬ 
render to the officers. 

Once in his hands, to his lasting 
credit, Sheriff Ralps coolly an¬ 
nounced that there would be no 
lynching and he meant just what 
he said. 

The jail in which Silver was 
confined was in charge of relatives 
of the officer that he killed and the 
treatment he received there ac¬ 
cording to his oath would have 
killed any but seasoned veteran. 

Being daily threatened with 
death at the stake, he pleaded 
guilty to killing the officer which, 
of course, was true. In spite of 
the circumstances attending the 
killing, which were in reach of 
the court, he was sentenced to 
hang. 

His Life Saved. 

The Editor of this journal, who 
had watched the case and noted 
the efforts of certain daily papers 
to excite mob violence, employed 
Attorney C. S. Dardin, a young 
colored lawyer, to defend Silver. 


















THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


Attorney Dardin volunteered .his 
services, the editor agreeing to 
raise the expense fund. Taking 
the case up with the Forum, 
the editor was appointed by that 
organization as its representative 
to solicit funds for the defense. 

A committee consisting of Att’y. 
Darden, A. C. Garrott and J. L. 
were appointed to visit Silver. 

Att’y Darden laid the founda¬ 
tion. 

Appeals for funds were promptly 
responded to by the colored people 
and, after a battle lasting thirteen 
months, the State Supreme Court 
requested Governor Gillette to 
commute the sentence to life im¬ 
prisonment, which was done after 
Silver had been twice sentenced 
to hang. 

Judge John D. Pitts Enters the 
Fight. 

While the excitement in the Sil¬ 
ver case was at fever heat, Judge 
Pitts, a Texan, whose sense of 
justice is his ruling passion volunteer¬ 
ed his services to assist in securing 
justice and fair play to the friendless 
man. He knew all of the circum¬ 
stances attending the killing and 
decided that what threatened to 
become a judicial lynching should 
not take place, if he could prevent 
it. 

Once into the case, although it 
had been closed and the innocent 
man’s doom sealed, the case was 
reopened and he immediately wrote 
Silver a letter telling him that he 
would never be hanged. The case 
was carried twice to the State Su¬ 
preme Court. When the attor¬ 
neys received a telegram that Sil¬ 
ver’s sentence had been commuted, 
they had everything ready to take the 
case to the U. S. Supreme Court. 

The news of Silver’s death comes 
to find his attorneys la 3 dng plans 
to secure his pardon. 

Edward Silver was reared in an 
orphan asylum in the state of New 
York. He was well liked wherever 
he lived. His army discipline 
served him well wherever fortune 
cast his lot. He was a model 
prisoner and numbered among his 
friends all of the prison officials. 


A man of good habits, always 
cool, a total stranger to fear, he 
displayed the white flag to none 
but death. 

The fact that this man went to 
prison at all,'shows the extent to 
which American manhood is being 
enslaved to degrading, insane, de¬ 
basing color prejudice. 

After receiving his sentence to 
hang, Silver wrote a letter to the 
editor of this journal, whom he 
never saw, asking him to do what 
he could to have his sentence 
commuted to life imprisonment. 
This request was granted. Though 
attached as affectionately as father 
and son the two men never met.

Miss Martha Drummer, a re¬ 
turned missionary from Angola, 
Africa, spoke at Wesley Chapel, 
last Sunday, on her work in Africa. 
It was one of the most interesting 
addresses ever delivered there. She 
gave much information that is 
new. Her description of the natives 
their physical development and 
power, their keen sense of honor 
and their moral purity was a reve¬ 
lation. Her plea for means to 
carry the gospel to those hungering 
people made a deep impression. 
Quite a sum of money was pldged. 


The Odd Fellows’s annual ser¬ 
mon was preached at Wesley Chap¬ 
el, last Sunday. It was attended 
by the largest crowd in its history. 

The several lodges made a splen¬

ON DANGEROUS GROUND 

On the question of amusements, 
the great M. E. church is on dan¬ 
gerous ground. The entertain¬ 
ment for even a moment of the 
suggestion of pulling down the 
bars, relative to worldly amuse¬ 
ments, shows whither the M. E. 
church is drifting. 

It was the small difference be¬ 
tween the church and the world 
in Wesley’s day that gave birth 
to our great church. To abolish 
the church rules prohibiting theater 
going, betting on horse races and 
such sinful pleasures, means the 
abandonment of everything that 


has made the great M. E. church 
a blessing to all mankind. To 
argue that these rules should be 
abolished because they are not 
enforced, is no argument whatever. 
Follow out this argument, and the 
ten commandments and with them 
all laws governing society would 
go. In Wesley’s day, the differ¬ 
ence between the church and the 
world was so small, that it was 
difficult to tell where the church 
ended and the world began. What 
were the conditions of society 
at that time? Was the world 
as big in charity for all mankind 
as it is now? 

If men and women are free to 
gamble, bet on horse races, go 
to theaters and dance, what will 
they have to do to forfeit their 
church membership? 

The 300,000 colored members 
of the M. E. Church are very anx¬ 
ious to have colored bishops elected 
at this session of the general con¬ 
ference; but this pales into insig¬ 
nificance besides the question of 
the church, relative to amusements. 

Let the church enforce its rules 
and let such as cannot obey them 
go. Make no surrender to the 
worldly minded. 

COTTON PICKERS NEEDED 

Negroes interested in Movement 

to Send Members of Their Race 

to Valley to Assist Farmers. 

A movement that has been in¬ 
stituted in Los Angeles for the 
betterment of the condition of 
Negroes who come here from the 
South, and which is commended 
by some of the leading Negroes of 
this city, is likely to be the means 
of sending to Imperial Valley a 
number of the best Negro cotton 
farmers who come from the south¬ 
ern cotton belt to California. 

For some time past leaders of 
the Negro citizenship here have 
felt that members of their race who 
come from farming districts of the 
South should be urged to get 
out into the agricultural districts 
of Southern California, rather than 
to seek locations in the city. 

To this end a company of colored 


men have been making an inspec¬ 
tion of conditions and lands in 
Imperial Valley. In the party were 
J. L. Edmonds, editor of the Lib¬ 
erator, a local Negro newspaper; 
G. Woodson Wickliffe, a local at¬ 
torney, and T. N. Alexander. These 
men made a thorough inspection 
of Imperial Valley from Brawley 
to Calexico, and were amazed 
at what is being done in cotton 
growing there, especially in the 
volunteering of cotton. 

These men, who have just re¬ 
turned from the valley, believe 
they will be doing the best class 
of Southern Negroes a good ser¬ 
vice by inducing them to go to 
Imperial Valley and engage in 
cotton growing, and that this will 
also be of service to the valley 
residents, as it will furnish an 
abundance of experienced labor for 
the cotton fields.— L. A. Times. 


SENATE REFUSES TO DIS¬ 
FRANCHISE 


The Senate, which is Republi¬ 
can, has refused to recede from 
its amendment to the joint reso¬ 
lution providing for the direct 
election of Senators. The amend¬ 
ment as proposed by the Senate 
retains the right of Congress to 
exercise a supervisory power over 
the time, manner and place of 
holding elections of Senators, 
whereas the original resolution 
gives this power to the States, 
which would spell absolute dis¬ 
franchisement of Afro-Americans 
in the South. 


COLORED SCHOLAR GETS 
DEGREE 


Harvard University has conferred 
the degree of doctor of philosophy 
on Mr. C. G. Woodson, a teacher 
in the M Street High School. 
Mr. Woodson is the second Afro- 
American to be thus honored: 
William E. Burghardt Du Bois, 
being the first.
