JAMES LOGAN MURDERED BV A 
MOB. 

That the murder of Mr. James Lo¬ 
gan near Raymond Hill, Pasadena, on 
the night of the 18th, was the work of 
a small mob, there is not the slightest 
doubt. It was the most fiendish, cold¬ 
blooded murder ever committed in 
this state. The shockingly mutilated 
corpse of the unfortunate young man 
showed that his murder had been at¬ 
tended by all the low, unspeakable. 
fiendish brutality characteristic of 
Southern mobs. That his murderers 
have had many previous experiences 
in slaughtering negroes there can be 
no doubt. Although unarmed, he put 
up a desperate fight for his life. His 
hands were literally hacked to pieces 
by grasping the stiletto that was being 
plunged into his breast, while a mem¬ 
ber of the mob from the rear was 
hammering out his brains with a 
heav} r piece of iron. He finally went 
down in the unequal contest, after 
which his throat was cut from ear to 
ear with a razor, one finger was cut 
off for a souvenir and—you can im¬ 
agine the rest- After throwing his 
body into a wash and covering it with 
new mown hay, some member of the 
mob committed a nuisance in his hat 
and with seared conscience and hearts 
out of which hope and love had for¬ 
ever fled, the mob dispersed. 

Among the Afro-Americans Logan 
had not an enemy. He was an octo¬ 
roon and was salesman and chief man 
in a store owned by a white man, and 
patronized only by wealthy people. 
Some person or persons for reasons 
known to them only wanted him 
out of the way. In Pasadena, 
owing to his business connections, his 
chums were mainly young white men 
with whom he seemed to be popular. 
Ir is now generally believed among 
Afro-Americans that he fell a victim 
to the blandishments of some woman 
whom he clandestinely met near Ray¬ 
mond hotel. Either he took some 
chum into his confidence or the wo¬ 
man was employed by his murderers. 
A trap was set into which he fell and 
was fiendishly murdered. If the offi¬ 
cers act upon the theory that Logan 
was murdered by Afro-Americans, the 
real murderers will escape. Afro- 
Americans never commit deeds of that 
kind. In the heat of passion they fre¬ 
quently take human life, but the sym¬ 


pathetic side of the Afro-American's 
nature is so well developed that he 
could not plan and execute such an in¬ 
human deed. If the Afro-Americans 
were to suddenly sink to such a low 
state of savagery, either mobs would 
be immediately suppressed or this 
country would become a roaring hell. 
God forbid that such a dreadful calam¬ 
ity ever come. 

“Jimmie Logan,” who so often sang 
so sweetly for charity, has gone the 
way of all the earth. If he made mis¬ 
takes let them be entered with his 
bones. He needs no sympathy now. 
Upon his bier as we drop the parting 
tear, let us look away to God and em* 
plore his mercy upon the miserable, 
hopeless wretches who murdered him. 


Broadway Department 
Store Endorsed by the 
Afro=Americans. 

Favors Appreciated. 

TRIBUTE PAID TO MR. ECCLESON. 

The great Broadway Department 
Store now gives twenty-one Afro- 
Americans employment, which is not 
only the largest number employed by 
any firm in the city but is a larger 
number than is employed by the coun¬ 
ty. We feel safe in saying that this 
great store employs five times as 
many Afro-Americans as any other 
store in the city, and gets perhaps five 
times as much patronage from the 
race. 

From time to time we have called 
the attention of our people to the con¬ 
sideration the proprieior and managers 
of this store were giving them and 
’lrged the necessity of reciprocation. 

The following shows how well they 
appreciate the opportunities given the 
race by this store: 

At a meeting of colored citizens of 
Los Angeles held April 0, 190G, the fol¬ 
lowing resolutions were unanimously 
adopted: 

Whereas, The opportunities for 
young colored men and women to se¬ 
cure positions of trust in mercantile 
establishments are very limited; and, 

Whereas, It requires men of moral 
courage and broad-mindedness to give 
equal opportunities to all, regardless 
of race, color or creed; and. 

Whereas, Mr. Arthur Letts, proprie¬ 
tor of the Broadway Department Store, 
and Mr. J. W. Eccleston, advertising 
manager for the Broadway Department 
Store, have recognized merit and abil¬ 
ity in the colored people of Los An¬ 
geles by giving to a number of them 
employment in the above-named store; 
and, 

Whereas, Mr. J. W. Eccleston is 
about to sever his connection with the 
Broadway Department store of Los 
Angeles, be it 

Resolved, That the colored people 


of Los Angeles hereby express their 
high appreciation for the manly and 
generous spirit of Messrs. Letts and 
Eccleston toward the colored people 
and press of Los Angeles, and be it 
further 

Resolved, That we profoundly re¬ 
gret the departure of Mr. Eccleston 
from Los Angeles, and we hereby re¬ 
cord and testify our admiration of him 
for the noble deeds of which we have 
been the beneficiaries. 

Resolved, That copies of these pre¬ 
ambles and resolutions be transmitted 
to Messrs. Letts and Eccleston.

Committee. 

Too much can not be said in com¬ 
mendation of the exemplary manner 
in which the Afro-American employes 
of that, store conduct themselves. Per¬ 
haps no employe of the store hold a 
higher place in the confidence of the 
managers than does Mr. W. C. Frank¬ 
lin. He is one of the oldest Afro- 
American employes. Mr. Homer L. 
Garrott, brother of Dr. A. C. Garrott, 
the popular dentist, is superintendent 
of the elevators. Commencing as an 
elevator man he has worked up until 
he is head of that department. 


One Afro-American Lynched for Kill¬ 
ing a Cow, Another Lynched for 
Killing a Horse. 

An Afro-American was lynched for 
killing a cow near Jackson, Mississ¬ 
ippi. In Louisiana another lynched 
for killing an officer’s horse while re¬ 
sisting arrest. That we are nearing 
a crisis in this lynching business does 
not admit of a doubt. That a conflict 
is upon us cannot be doubted. That 
all Afro-Americans must arm for self¬ 
protection is the decre of fate. Every 
Afro-American must buy a Winchester 
rifle and when mobs threaten to raise 
hell, they must tender their services 
to the officers of the law to aid them 
in keeping the peace. If your services 
are refused, act independently, up¬ 
holding the majesty of the law at all 
hazznrds. The white cut-throats that 
lynch and burn Afro-Americans, are 
the same class that wreck trains, go 
on strikes, burning and destroying the 
property of the rich, assassins, bomb 
throwers, dynamiters, and high-way 
robbers. Every Afro-American who 
kills a lyncher renders to the country 
a greater service than Dewey did at 
Manilla Bay. Citizens who disregard 
the Jaws of the country are its most 
deadly foes. 

“They who would be free 

Themselves must strike the blow.”

TWO AFRO-AMERICANS LYNCH A 
MOB. 

By direct wire to the Times. 

Yonkers, N. Y., May 13.—(Exclusive 
dispatch.) One man is dead, one is 
dying and a third is in a dangerous 
condition, as a result of a race riot 
last night. Np negro was injured. 

Mary Wilson and Edward White, 
mother and son, both negroes, are un¬ 
der arrest. 

No one seems to know how the riot 
started. Several men were fighting in 
an alley. Others, Caucasians and 
negroes, joined them, until the riot 
was in full swing. 

White’s mother ran out of her home 
with a razor, and White became pos¬ 
sessed of a very sharp case knife. 
With these weapons, the two soon 
cleared the field. 

Michael Fitzgerald was found with 
his jugular vein s-evered and his head 
and body badly cut. 

Thomas Eagan had cuts in the head 
and was disemboweled. 

John Dowd had bad cuts in head and 
body. 

Fitzgerald died in St. Joseph’s Hos¬ 
pital at 5 o’clock this morning. Little 
hopes are entertained of Eagan’s re¬ 
covery. Dowd is in a dangerous con¬ 
dition. 

Several other men received slight 
cuts, but were able to get away. 

To the Afro-Americans, the above is 
not only inspiring, but furnishes a 
valuable object lesson. If two Afro- 
Americans, one man, and one woman, 
armed only with a razor and a case 
knife, and a determination to sell their 
lives at a high price, can put a whole 
mob of white ruffians out of business 
and lynch two of its members, what 
could a dozen Afro-Americans armed 
with Winchester rifles do? If White 
and his brave mother had not shown 
fight both would have been killed and 
their cowardly murderers would have 
gone un-whipped of justice. The best 
and surest way to punish mobs is to 
punish them while they are engaged 
in violating the law. There can be no 
better way of getting evidence against 
members of mobs than that of killing 
and wounding a goodly number of 
them. 

The killing of a few members of 
every mob by intended victims will 
bring these low mangy scoundrels to 
their senses quicker than any other 
argument that can be made. Juries 
will not convict members of mobs for 
killing Afro-Americans unless the 
killing of the Afro-Americans 
makes labor too scarce as it does oc- 
cassionallv in Mississippi. The best 
and onlv wav to reason with a mob is 
with cold steel. 

Every Afro-American’s cabin must 
contain one rifle and shot gun and each 
member of the family taught how to 
handle them. No Afro-American was 
ever lynched who faced mobs with 
cold steel. 

You have but one time to die and 


to die defending one’s life, liberty and 
home, is to receive God’s eternal favor. 
The man who is ready to die for his 
rights, will live and enjoy them. 


WHITE MEN AND WOMEN VICTIMS 
OF MOBS. 

A few days ago a white man in Ten¬ 
nessee received an anonymous letter 
warning him to leave his home and 
community or take the consequences. 
He got his field-piece ready and await¬ 
ed developments. A night or two af¬ 
ter receiving the notice a mob fired 
upon his house wounding him and his 
daughter. He returned the fire and 
killed Melvin Winters a member of 
the mob who was found stiff and stark 
near the house the next morning. The 
state had first-class evidence against 
one cowardly lyncher at least. 

The wholesale lynching and burning 
of Negro men, women and children has 
so blunted respect for human life that 
white cut-throats have commenced kill¬ 
ing their own women. 

On the 15th, a white man in Geor¬ 
gia, named Clark, because his sweet¬ 
heart’s father didn’t care for him to 
call, set their home on fire and when 
the father and son came out to fight 
the fire he shot both. He then cut a 
wide swath, driving everything white 
before him. When his ammunition 
was about out he called at a store to 
replenish his stock, the merchants, 
who had been notified, refused to sup¬ 
ply him. For that offense he killed 
one of the merchants. Finding him¬ 
self pursued by blood hounds and sur¬ 
rounded by the officers, he put a bul¬ 
let through his own heart. Commenc¬ 
ing by killing and burning negroes he 
ended by killing whites and burning 
their homes. The whole bunch reaped 
only what they sowed. 


BLACK KNOCKERS AND WHITE 
SUPPORTERS. 

The disposition of Afro-Americans 
to pull each other down is so general 
that no class or condition is exempt. 
If this feeling of envy and jealousy 
was confined to the ignorant, worthless 
class it could in a measure be over¬ 
looked. It is a relic of barbarism 
handed down from slavery that is very 
frequently found In negroes that never 
saw slavery. This low contemptible 
feeling is to be found among the big 
negroes and little negroes, among the 
so-called intelligent negroes and ig¬ 
norant negroes. 

By the eternal devil it is wherever 
you find negroes. Trying to pull down 
attorney Blair. 

Some time ago the friends of an 
Afro-American charged with murder, 
believing that he acted in self-defense, 
secured the services of attorney Blair 
to defend him. As a criminal lawyer, 
Mx. Blair has a fine record and stands 
high at the bar, a thing of which 
every member of the race should be 
proud. As should have been done, an 


ample fee was being quietly raised by 
the Afro-Americans. As soon as the 
black knockers heard of it, the big and 
little ones got together, called a coun¬ 
cil of war to take the case from Blair 
and give it to a white lawyer, this, 
after Mr. Blair had made all necessary 
preparation for the defense. One big 
knocker said he would give $25 if the 
case was given to a white attorney, 
but would not give a cent if Blair was 
retained. The case was taken from 
Blair, the big knocker gave $10 instead 
of the $25 promised. A number of 
Afro-Americans engaged in raising 
money, quit when Blair was relieved. 

On another occasion, some Afro- 
Americans called upon a white attor¬ 
ney to take a case for them. The at¬ 
torney after inquiring into the case 
called Mr. Blair up over the phone, 
requesting him to take it. Then turn¬ 
ing to the black people said: “I have 
got Mr. Blair to take your case, he is 
a member of your race and is one of 
the ablest lawyers at the bar.” Mr. 
Blair won the case and the black 
knocker was knocked out by the white 
supporter. Mr. Blair has no trouble 
in securing the aid of the white people 
when he needs it as surety on the 
bonds of clients. We have refrained 
from mentioning the names of the big 
knockers because their children will 
blush in years to come when they read 
the records of our present struggle, 
should the part their parents are tak¬ 
ing be recorded. 

There never was a time when the 
race needed able, strong, race-loving 
professional men and women, profes¬ 
sional men and women who are not 
ashamed to be identified with us as a 
people. To succeed in this country 
the race will have to build up a busi¬ 
ness and professional class of its own. 
The Afro-American who is engaged in 
pulling down his race is digging a pit 
for his own children. 

Whether your children are white 
negroes or black negroes, rich negroes 
or poor negroes, they are going to 
meet the same discrimination meted 
out to black negroes, until we stand 
together as men and break them down. 


THE SPRINGFIELD, OHIO, MOB 
ENDORSED. 

The members of the Springfield, 
Ohio, mob that were convicted for the 
part they took in the recent mob out¬ 
rages in that city were fined one dollar 
each. The judge promptly remitted 
the fines, thus endorsing the mob. 
Comment is unnecessary. The state¬ 
ment that the frequency of mob reign 
in that city is due to the non-enforce¬ 
ment of the laws have been fully veri¬ 
fied.

THE PRESIDENT’S ODIOUS ALLI¬ 
ANCE. 

The President’s alliance with Sena¬ 
tor Tillman and his gang must, ere 
this, have brought forcibly to his mind 
the truthfulness of that rustic old 
saying: “If you lie down with dogs you 
get up with fleas.” We are neither 
surprised nor sorry about the ridicu¬ 
lous predicament in which the^ 
President finds himself.. A tour of the' 
South has put on the wane the glory 
of every republican president that 
made it, save Gen. Grant. To secure 
the passage of his pet measure, the 
Rate Bill, the President needed a few 
democratic votes as the platform upon 
which he was elected did not commit 
him or his party to it. He went' South 
to get them, how he succeeded is yet to 
be seen. His Southern trip was a 
howling success from the view point of 
the negro haters. So far as the Afro- 
American and his rights are concerned, 
the President came back a changed 
man—his mouth and the “$oor of hope 
had been closed;” that inspiring dec¬ 
laration, “All men up and not some 
men down,” that threatened to im¬ 
mortalize him had become obsolete. 'In 
his strenuousness he stepped off the 
platform upon which he wias elected 
and fell among thieves as the sequel 


shows. Senator Tillman who, till re¬ 
cently was the President’s spokesman 
for the Rate Bill, stood up in the 
United States Senate and declared that 
he and his associates had “murdered 
negroes” for voting and had stuffed 
ballot boxes and would do so again, in 
violation of the laws of the land. 

In spite of this and since he made 
the above statement the President is 
quoted as saying that Senator Tillman 
is an honest man. In view of Sena¬ 
tor Tillman’s own confessions of being 
a murderer and a thief, the President’s 
declaration that he, Tillman, is an hon¬ 
est man, caused some people to won¬ 
der what constitutes honesty. Now 
the man who murdered Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans and stuffed ballot boxes, and 
whom the President says is honest, 
charges 'the President with making 
statements about certain republican 
senators that the President felt called 
upon to deny. Denials and counter de¬ 
nials by the President and Tillman re¬ 
semble'a. lot of boys playing marbles 
“for keeps.” The President made a 
mistake when he said Tillman was 
honest. 

The President made a mistake when 
he decided to sacrifice the Afro-Ameri¬ 
can and his rights to secure the pas¬ 
sage of the now famous Rate Bill. 

By that act he placed a higher value 
upon the dollar than upon manhood 
rights, and consequently human life. 
Committed to such an erroneous pol¬ 
icy, a man is sure of making nothing, 
but blunders. It is an error of i the 
President’s head, not of his heart. 
That, it is a mistake to believe that a 
murderer and theif is a respector or 
persons, is amply proven by the Roose- 
velt-Tillman alliance., The President 
will either have to get back upon the 
republican platform or go into obliv¬ 
ion with Grover Cleveland, the only 
man in all the world that has no party. 


THE EARTHQUAKE WIPED OUT 
THE COLOR LINE. 

For the time being the Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans in San Francisco are not hind¬ 
ered by the hell-born color line, the 
earthquake having destroyed it.,The 
loss of life among them was practical¬ 
ly nothing owing to the fact that color 
discriminations had driven them out 
of the danger zone. The awfulness of 
the calamity reduced all to a common 
level. Labor unions that had almost 
crunshed out the Afro-American’s 
manhood, immediately announced that 
no discrimination would be practiced 
while rebuilding the city. 

If earthquake will shake down color 
prejudice, there ought to he real heavy 
ones all over this sin-cursed country. 
In the name of God give us anything 
that will blot out, even for a while, 
color prejudice, race hate and race dis¬ 
criminations and give the religion of 
Jesus Christ a cliance to get a little 


foot-hold. The concentration of wealth, 
hypocrisy, sin and crime are about,the 
only things that are on the increase 
In this Christian land. Lord, regard¬ 
less of the means employed, give us 
a change.

GOOD-BYE, GOOD-BYE, ACROSS 
THE SEA. 

'■ (Written for the Liberator.) 

It was in the long ago— 

In the fading twilight glow, 

As I stood by the murmuring sea— 

A voice of tender melody. 

Sang in accents sweet to me 
Good-bye, good-bye, across the sea. 

I gazed upon the waters wide, 

I watched the flow and ebb of tide,. 

I heard the night winds softly sigh, 
I heard the swift-winged sea-bird’s cry, 
Whilst a sad voice sang to me. 
Good-bye, good-bye, across the sea. 

The years have come, the years have 
gone ' i 

Into night's oblivion; 

I still stand by the restless waves 
Thinking of the grass-grown graves, 
But that voice still sings to me 
Good-bye, good-bye across the sea.

that the seating capacity of our 
churches is being continually in¬ 
creased, all seats are taken at 1 the 
Shnday services. Compared to the

must be at least fifty per cent greater 
than the former. 


ITMES OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

Lieut. Colonel Allensworth is deliv¬

the direction of right living. He is 
anxious to organize a boys’ brigade,,an 
organization, the value of which can 
hardly be over estimated. He is en¬ 
gaged in a laudable undertaking and 
deserves encouragement.

NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE. 

It was only recently, according to a 
correspondent, that in St. Paul’s Ca¬ 
thedral a London guide held forth to 
an American gentleman: “That, sir, 
is the tomb of the greatest naval ’ero 
Europe or the ’ole world never knew.” 
“Yes? M “It is, sir, the toifcb of Lord 
Nelson. This marble sarcophiggus 
weighs 42 tons. Hinside that is a 
steel receptacle weighing 12 tons, 
and hinside that is a leaden casket 
ermetically sealed weighing two tons, 
hinside that is a ma-ogany coffin ’old- 
ing the hashes of the great ’ero.” 
“Well,” said the American, after re-, 
fleeting a moment, “I reckon you’ve 
got him. If he ever gets out of that, 
telegraph me at my expense:”—The

A certain Pittsburg millionaire visit¬ 
ed Philadelphia not long ago, and his 
business leading him to the splendid 
Academy of the Natural Sciences, he 
found himself walking in and out 
among the cases of stuffed birds. 
There are thousand? of lifelike feath¬ 
ered creatures gathered there, and the 
finest in America. ^he custodian 
could not help praising it with ex¬ 
cusable warmth. 

'“I’ve never figured it out,” said he, 
at last, “but it is safe to say, at a 
guess, that these stuffed birds are 
worth not less than $200,000.” 

“Heavens!” exclaimed the man of 
money, “is it possible? What are they 
stuffed with?”—Harper’s Weekly.

GAS NEARLY KILLED TOURIST. 

W. H. Bomgarcl-ener, of Scranton, 
Iowa, was awakened at G o’clock 
Thursday morning in his room, 225 
North Olive street, almost overcome 
by escaping gas. With great difficulty 
he arose, and then fell on the floor, 
which Immediately aroused the occu¬ 
pants, who came to his rescue by 
breaking down the- door. His friend* 
W. L. Myers, of the Conservative 
Realty Company, was notified at once 
at the Severance building, as they dis¬ 
covered his card in the old gentleman’s 
pocket. Mr. Myers promptly attended 
to his wants, and the patient is re¬ 
ported doing nicely-
