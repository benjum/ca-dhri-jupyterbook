THB LIBERATOR, 



MR. G. B. LEWIS. 

Mr. G. B. Lewis, of the firm of Smith 
& Lewis, is another example of push 
and well-directed energy. Six years 
ago he was in the employ of the Cass 
& Smurr Stove Company. While in 
the employ of this company lie opened 
a repair shop in the rear of his home; 
where he did odd jobs during evenings. 
I he volume of this work increased so 
rapidly that he found it necessary to 
resign and open business for himself. 
Forming a co-partnership with Mr. 
Smith, they opened a general stove and 
repair business. Their place of business, 
6n South Broadway, is one of the neat¬ 
est to be found in the city. In order to 
make room for their increasing busi¬ 
ness, they have just added 400 square 
feet to the store, They carry a $5000 
stock. 

* * * 

Blacksmiths. Of the men who follow 
the useful trade of blacksmith, we have 
a large number, the more prominent of 
whom are Messrs. Samuel Simms and 
L. J. Shores. Mr. Simms, whose place 
of business is 227 San Pedro street, is 
a well equipped establishment, with 
plenty of work, and enjoys the confi¬ 
dence of his neighbors and patrons. He 
owns an elegant home, and is well 
fixed. 


Mr. I hos. Wilkins. Eight years ago 
Mr. Wilkins came to this city. After 
seeking employment in white tinning 
establishments for several days in vain, 
he rented a small place, and set lip for 
himself. I he color line which operated 
against him when seeking employment 
of others cut no figure when he 09111- 
menced employing himself. He now 
has one of the most complete estab¬ 
lishments in the city, and has a stand¬ 
ing contract' with the Salt Lake Rail¬ 
road to furnish lamps and oilers for 
the road. He also has contracts with 
the National Ice Company and other 
firms of equal standing. His place of 
business is 925 East First street. If 
you have what people want, the color 
of your skin is no obstacle. This can¬ 
not be too strongly emphasized. 

* * * 

Mr. W. H. Smith, dealer in gents’ 
furnishing goods, 215 E. Second street, 
is doing a good business. He is the 
first colored man to embark in this 
business in this city. He is polite, hon¬ 
est and energetic, and will succeed. 

* * * 

Grocers. We have two grocery es¬ 
tablishments, both of which enjoy an 
increasing trade. Mr. C. C. Flint, 2^ 

E. Second street, carries a neat stock 
that is complete in every particular. 
The tasteful manner in which his stock 
is displayed shows that he understands 
his business. 


DR. GEO. D. TAYLOR. 

Doctor Taylor, who will preside at 
Simpson's Auditorium and will intro¬ 
duce Prof. Booker T. Washington, Tan. 
3rd, 1903. At that time Prof. Washing¬ 
ton will address the colored citizens aiVl 
others. Dr. Taylor was delegate to the 
last National Colored Business Men’s 
League, held at Richmond, Va., last 
summer. Prof. Washington is president. 
Dr. Taylor is a successful physician, a 
broad-gauge young man and popular in 
business and social circles. 


Mr. Eugene Walker is one of the 
best-known colored business men in the 
city. Embarking in the tailoring busi¬ 
ness single-handed and alone, a few 
years ago, he has in spite of the keen 
competition in his. line, he now employs 
nine persons, and has all the work he 
can do. As Mr. Walker makes only 
high-priced ^ clothing, his patrons are 
mainly white. He not only greatly 
benefits the race by furnishing employ¬ 
ment to its members, but gives every 
young colored ..man or woman who de¬ 
sires it, an opportunity to learn the 
trade. Those who have served under 
him are doing well. Every colored man 
who succeeds in any laudable undertak¬ 
ing not only makes it easier for others 
to succeed, but furnishes employment 
for other members of his race. This 
is what Eugene Walker is doing. His 
place is 632 S. Main.

SOME NOTED HOMES. 

Nothing so forcibly illustrates the 
wonderful progress made by the colored 
people since • the emancipation as their 
many beautiful homes scattered every¬ 
where throughout the city. We refer 
to the emancipation because most of 
the colored people are from the South, 
and were slaves or descendants of 
slaves. One remarkable thing in this 
connection is that so little is known of 
the possessions owned by the colored 
people of this city by their white fellow 
citizens. These splendid modern homes 
that are found everywhere in the city 
are credited to the white people, for 
these homes and grounds are as well if 
not better kept than those of their white 
neighbors. On this account the white 
people do not know where the colored 
live or what they possess. The hun¬ 
dreds of colored janitors and laborers 
tliat are seen about the business portion 
of the city are supposed to live in tene¬ 
ment houses in the cheap sections, but 
they don't. The street cars that take 
their thousands homeward at the close 
of the day take them to the refined sec¬ 
tions of the city, where they spend their 
evenings amidst scenes of culture and 
refinement in houses provided with all 
modern improvements. 

* * * 

To give even a short description 
of the scores of elegant homes 
owned by the colored people of 
this city would require many com¬ 
plete editions of this journal. Owing to 
our limited space we can mention only 
a few of them at this time. What our 
people are doing and what they own 
will be made a special feature of The 
Liberator for the next year, for nothing 
better proves the honesty, industry, fru¬ 
gality and intelligence of a man or 
woman than the ownership of a well- 
kept home. Whatever tends to encour¬ 
age home building, tends to encourage¬ 
ment of good citizenship. 

The $ro,ooo home of Mr. R. C. Owens, 
corner Tenth and Albany streets, is the 
landmark of that vicinity, it having no 
equal there. It is a handsome two- 
story building surrounded by well-kept 
grounds, beautified by ornamental plants 
and shrubbery. Its interior furnishings 
are costly and beautiful. The landscape 
and other paintings that decorate the 
walls of the spacious rooms are pro¬ 
ductions from the brush of Mrs. Owens 
and are splendid works of art. Mrs. 
Owens is a former student of the Ober- 
]in, Ohio, college. 

* * * 

With a clean, closely mowed lawn as 
a foreground, with a wilderness of pot- 
led plants swinging from the eaves of 
veranda, the home of Mr. G. B. Lewis, 
No. 1322 Girard street, is a model of 
neatness. It stands among the neigh¬ 
boring buildings almost without a peer. 
To fully appreciate it one must see its 
tastefully arranged interior. A well se¬ 
lected library of standard works is one 
of the pleasing features of this model 
home. But this is true of all the re¬ 


spectable colored homes and none are 
belter provided with good books, all 
things considered. Pardon this digres¬ 
sion, but where there are no books there 
is no home. 

* * * 

Mrs. W. E. Reid's six-room cottage, 
1336 Winfield street, is a credit to its 
locality as well as to its owner. Mrs. 
Reid is leading colored dressmaker in 
the city. She has an up-to-date dress¬ 
making establishment in the rear of her 
home where ten ladies, white and col¬ 
ored, are kept busy. Her work is of 
the- exclusive kind, her patrons being 
confined to the wealthy classes. 

Mrs. Chandler. Our visit to the 
home of Mrs. Reid was made unusually 
pleasant by meeting her mother, Mrs. 
Chandler, whom we knew in Mississippi 
more than twenty years ago. We were 
teachers in the same district. To per¬ 
petuate her memory and the work she 
did for the elevation of the people, a 
memorial church was built and is known 
as Chandler’s Chapel to this day. She 
is the mother of Rev. A. D. Chandler, a 
distinguished minister and educator. 
She is well preserved—the indication 
of a well-spent life. 

* * * 

The home of Mrs. L. V. Brown, 1522 
Winfield street, speaks volumes for its 
keepers, Mrs. Brown and her handsome 
daughter. Mrs. Brown is a widow and 
too much can not be said in commenda¬ 
tion of the creditable manner in which 
her home and grounds are kept. Miss 
Brown would have a number of suit¬ 
ors but the looks of her home acts as a 
warning for them to keep away unless 
they possess a thorough knowledge of 
lanscape gardening. 

* * * 

The Scott H/all, 561 Central avenue, 
is a combination of a home and public 
hall. It is a neat two-story building 
containing six rooms below with a hall 
above. The double floors between the 
hall and the lower story are so ar¬ 
ranged that the noise made by the goat- 
riders above is not heard by the dwell¬ 
ers below. It is a splendid home, every¬ 
thing being so arranged as to combine 
comfort and beauty. It is an elegant 
home with not a charm wanting. The 
hall above is a monument to Mr. Scott’s 
far-seeing business sagacity and in tnis 
he is the benefactor of every colored 
secret society in the city, for he fur¬ 
nished them a permanent home. Other¬ 
wise they might now have nowhere to 
meet, as most of the public halls are 
closed to them. They acted wisely in 
taking his hall as soon as it was com¬ 
pleted. It is an up-to-date hall and its 
walls are literally covered with the char¬ 
ters of the different secret orders. Mr. 
Scott says: “The best way to break 
down the color line is to have your own 
things.” Mr. Scott came here nine 
years ago from Georgia, He can get 
$5000 for his property, but he does not 
want it. 



DEPUTY SHERIFF J. B. LOVING. 

Mr. Loving, who has served four 

years as depirfy^sheriff, has made a good 
officer and reflected credit upon all con¬ 
cerned. He is the first colored man to 
serve in this capacity and the colored 
citizens are proud of his record. If his 
successor is to be a colored man, be will 
do well to copy Mr. Loving’s example. 
Among the secret societies, Mr. Loving 
is a leader. 

* * * 

I. Enclosed by a well-trimmed ever¬ 

green hedge, 724 Clanton St., is the neat 
five-room cottage of Mr. Henry Busby. 
This is another of our creditable homes 
that not only reflects credit upon its 

owner but adds to the beauty of the 
street and swells the taxable valuation 
of its locality. Mr. Busby is night 
watchman at the city hall and is one of 
the city’s trusted employees. 

* * * 

The neat five-room cottage, 1427 New¬ 
ton street, is the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
R. A. Washington. It is an elegant, at¬ 
tractive home and is often the scene of 
social gatherings as Mrs. Washington 
is a member of the Woman's Club and 
other societies for the advance/ncnt /of 
the race. Mr. Washington is a pa¬ 
triotic, spirited citizen 3ml can always 
be relied upon where the cause of the 
race needs his assistance. Of the nice 
home be is justly proud. 

* * * 

Mr. L. J. Shores is one of the few 
young colored men who have adopted 
blacksmitbing as a trade.. £Tc is making 
a success. The desire for the rc'*' 
dollar to blow in, on picnics and excur¬ 
sions is working great injury to our 
young men. It destroys their willing¬ 
ness to work out an apprenticeship in 
order to master a trade. The opportu¬ 
nity to .be master instead of servant is 
sold for a mess of pottage. In every 
colored blacksmith shop there ought to 
be one or more colored apprentices.

A SUCCESSFUL YEAR—The year 
ending with this edition of “The Lib¬ 
erator” has been the most suc¬ 
cessful in its history. As a molder of 
healthy public sentiment it has done 
its part, without fear or favor. With 
the Liberator men and principles are 
held above parties and policies. To be 
right is our highest ambition. When 
we decide that a certain course is right, 
we pursue it with all the vigor at our 
command. Men are our ideals. In a 
republic like curs men are worth more 
than armies and navies. To perpetuate 
freedom men must be free—free to 
think and act for themselves. To stim¬ 
ulate freedom of thought and independ¬ 
ent action among its colored readers 
has been the main object of this jour¬ 
nal. Its success has been extremely 
gratifying not only to us, hut to the 
friends of the race as well. The pro¬ 
motion of good government and the ad¬ 
vancement of the Afro-Americans has 
and will ever occupy the main attention 
of this journal. The friends of the ne¬ 
gro will have the support of the Lib¬ 
erator regardless of party or section in 
which they may reside. With the ene¬ 
mies of law and order we make no com¬ 
promise. A thing is either right or 
wrong. Right should be upheld and 
wrong condemned. The man who will 
not stand for what he believes to be 
right cannot trust himself. 


We have devoted considerable space 
to encouraging business enterprises 
among our people and much has been 
acco,mp]ished along this line. Many 
homes have been purchased and much 
valuable real estate has been acquired 
and the movement has been steady and 
onward. 

The paper has been generously sup¬ 
ported, its circulation has increased 
and it continues to occupy a warm 
place in the hearts of the people. As a 
molder of opinion and action its suc¬ 
cess has been phenomenal; so much so 
that it is rated everywhere as a journal 
with an object in view with the 
backbone to stand ever on the firing 
line. 

Hon. T. Thomas Fortune, editor of 
the New York Age, whom President 
Roosevelt appointed as special commis¬ 
sioner to investigate conditions in the 
Hawaiian and Philippine Islands, was 
entertained in San Francisco as becomes 
a gentleman of his abilit} r and worth. 
As a journalist he is perhaps without a 
peer. J 


The President’s Message is a strong 
document and is in keeping with his 
former state papers. The President 
touched upon all questions that he 
deemed of interest to the country. The 
coal strike, which is a local question, 
was not overlooked. But the nullifi¬ 
cation of the Negro’s constitutional 
rights which is a national question, was 
not mentioned. This is a matter of 
vastly more importance to the Negroes 
than appointment of a few federal of¬ 
ficers. The right of trial by jury, when 
charged with offenses, and the right to 
vote and have it counted, are matters 
not only vital to the Negro but to the 
whole country. 


Mayor Snyder's Great Victory. The 
re-election of Mayor Snyder with a 
magnificent plurality of 3000 is not only 
a great victory for him blit for the in¬ 
dependent voter and liberal Republicans. 
It is a victory for honesty in public of¬ 
fice and, says the young men who as¬ 
pire to preferment, that honesty is worth 
more than party nomination. The vot¬ 
ers have put themselves on record in 
no uncertain terms as placing good 
government above party. It puls a pre¬ 
mium on fidelity to a public trust. The 
defeat of Mayor Snyder would have 
been more disastrous to the young men 
of the city than to him, by putting a dis¬ 
count on honesty. It was a triumph for 
good government, a triumph for the in¬ 
dependent, progressive people of the 
city, a triumph for The Liberator, that 
has aided materially to bring about this 
splendid result. 


Those political amateurs who tried to 
frighten the colored voters away from 
Mayor Snyder by waving the bloody 
shirt, heard something “drap” the other 


day. It fell hardest in the Seventh 
ward, where most of the colored voters 
live and where The Liberator has its 
largest circulation. As for the old 
bloody shirt, it used to swing from the 
Times building, but a few shells from 
"ITie Liberator’s batteries caused it to be 
hauled down never to lie raised again in 
tliat quarter. When these fellows have 
been here long enough to understand 
California politics they will discover 
that they are different from Southern 
politics. These fledglings will yet learn 
that The Liberator has made the bloody 
shirt useless as a political argument, by 
teaching the colored voters to think, O 
yes, that old garment may stain peed the 
steers in Texas, but won’t frighten them 
here. 


Mr. Young worth's Mistake. If the 
management of the campaign among the 
colored voters had been placed in the 
hands of Mr. James Vena or some man 
like him in whom they had confidence 
the res*uIt might have been different, es¬ 
pecially in the Seventh ward. When the 
Republican managers turned the intel¬ 
ligent Negroes down, word was passed 
down the line that whenever the Negro 
could make himself felt, it was to be 
made against the party. Read the re¬ 
turns in the colored precincts. Mr. Lau¬ 
der in the Seventh ward was marked as 
the easiest target, as his majorities have 
always been small. One thing that the 
party leaders should not loose sight of, 
and that is that the intelligent colored 
men of this city are in complete touch 
with each other and know how and will 
resent an insult such as setting up ig¬ 
norant or irresponsible men as leaders 
for the Negroes. Better let the Negroes 
choose their own leaders. 


Will Arouse Suspicion. Hereafter 
in local elections the would-be leaders 
who are found running around trying 
to hoodwink the colored voters into vot¬ 
ing “de whole ticket''' will either be put 
under the ban of suspicion or passed 
unnoticed as ignoramuses. The colored 
voters are not fools. They read aiv are 
in touch with the progressive element 
with whom they live, and will vote and 
act as become worthy American citizens. 
The white republican papers urged the 
voters to vote independent in local elec¬ 
tions. The black republican papers 
urged the colored voters to vote the 
whole ticket—for what? If the best in¬ 
terest of all are served by independent 
voting among the white voters, why 
should not the colored voters do like¬ 
wise? Isn't their Interest identical with 
that of the white voters? The Negro 
can not rightfully lay claim to equality 
with the white man until he learns to 
act as the white man does. Our policy 
is to do a thing as the white man does 
it, not as he tells us to do it. See?

MR. R. C. OWENS. 

Mr. Owens, dealer in real estate and 
loans, is well known and popular. He 

OUR BUSINESS AND PROFES- 
FESSIONAL MEN. 

Mr. H. Stricklin, the butcher, landed 
here eight years ago with $7 and his 
knowledge of carving meat. He se¬ 
vered a loan of $80 and gave his note 
for $120, and opened a butcher shop at 
804 Central avenue. Besides the owner¬ 
ship 01 several houses and lots which 
bring him a good income, he has just 
bought the property adjoining his shop, 
which extends from Central avenue to 
Lynden street. On Central avenue he 
is building a two-story structure with 
a butcher shop and store below, and a 
twenty-room flat above. O11 the Lynden 
street front lie has erected a neat six- 
room cottage. The cost of the lot and 
buildings is $to,ooo. 

* * * 

DOCTOR M. E. SYKES. 

Of our four colored physicians Dr. 
Sykes may be placed at the bead, being 
the oldest and best known. PI is prac¬ 
tice is a large and lucrative one, he hav¬ 
ing a larger white practice than any 
colored physician. It is not overstating 
the fact to say that he has a larger 
white practice than some of our well-to- 
do white physicians have. In his real 
estate ventures the Doctor has been 
equally successful. His real estate hold¬ 
ings are worth $50,000. Besides four 
flats, which pay well on the investment, 
he owns seven houses, which bring a 
monthly income of $175- His resdence, 


is a heavy real estate owner and is meet¬ 
ing with success in handling real estate 
and loans. 

126 N. Ohio street, which is not yet 
completed, cost $3000. His two-story 
barn in the rear is a model. Mrs. 
Sykes, his bride of less than a year, 
suggested the plans for this residence; 
this means that it is wanting in nothing 
that can add to its comfort and at¬ 
tractiveness. 

* * * 


DR. J. S. OUTLAW. 

Dr. Outlaw, late pension examiner o'? 
Washington, D. C., is strictly a recent 
settler in the city. In spite of this, lie 
has built up a remarkably large prac¬ 
tice. He is a well-equipped, affable gen¬ 
tleman and already has a host of friends. 
Pie has the confidence of the people gen¬ 
erally and is certain to succeed. 

* * * 

Dr. T. J. Nelson, who recently gradu¬ 
ated from the Cooper Medical College 
of San Francisco, has not hung out his 
shingle yet. The place selected for his 
future triumph is yet unknown to ns. 
After the Doctor has had a good, much- 
needed rest we will hear from him. 

* * * 

Dr. A. C. Garrott, die dentist, has a 
good field and he is equal to the. occa¬ 
sion. He can do anything in his line 
and do it as well as any other dentist 
can. This is attested by the fact that 
he has all the work he can do. His of¬ 
fice is in the Wilson block, corner 
Spring and First. 


It is with pride that we present these 
gentlemen to our readers. They show 
the progress the race has made in 35 
years of freedom. The editor of this 
journal was living and well remembers 
when the ancestors of these gentlemen 
were for sale. Pie knows how to appre¬ 
ciate the progress made by them. 


MRS. NANNIE REYNOLDS. 

Among our enterprising citizens who 
are making a success by making them¬ 
selves a necessity, Mrs. Nannie Rey¬ 
nolds, the cateress, holds a prominent 
place. So well has she performed her 
duties to those requiring her srvices 
that she gives regular employment to 
twelve persons, ail colored. She was 
compelled to decline the request of the 
cplored citizens to prepare a banquet 
for Prof. Booker T. Washington, on 
recount of previous engagements, which 
dale far into the new year. Her patrons 
are confined almost exclusively to the 
wealthy classes. Her six-room cottage, 
1320 Albany street, is in keeping with 
ifs owner. It is neatly and attractive 1 - 
furnished. Mrs. Reynolds is a young 
widow and a thorough-going business 
woman. 

* * * 

Mr. Charles Beard, better known as 
“Billy the Chimney Sweep,” with a 
small cabin mounted on wheels, drawn 
by his span of beautiful ponies, attracts 
attention whenever he drives through 
the streets and advertises his business 
in a telling way. He is industrious and 
has a monopoly in his line. “Billy and 
his ponies have a place in every street 
parade and altogether form a unique at¬ 
traction. The thing looks funny but 
to “Billy” it is a paying proposition and 
few laboring men gather in as large a 
week’s pay as “Billy" does.

SUPPLEMENT. 

THE LIBERATOR. 


Booker T. Washington 
Says the White People 
of America have great 
Opportunity. 

Prof. Booker T. Washington, who is 
expected to visit the Coast early in 
1903, in a speech at the Armstrong 
Manual Training school* Washington, 
D. C., said: 

“That it was more honorable in his 
estimation for the negro boy to be¬ 
come a first class truck gardener in his 
community than to become a third rate 
lawyer or school teacher. ‘The negro 
woman who can put so much brains 
and skill and dignity into laundering 
that she becomes unexcelled in that oc¬ 
cupation will not find herself debarred 
from the work of customers on account 
of her race,” Mr. Washington declared. 
He emphasized the necessity of train¬ 
ing the hands as well as the head, and 
said that if this plan was not carried 
out the colored race would he disap¬ 
pointed in the results. 

“There are some, I fear,” he con¬ 
tinued, “who feel that the problems 
confronting the race can be solved by 
a series of talks or orations. One. thou¬ 
sand bushels of the best quality of po¬ 
tatoes produced by the hands of an 
educated negro are worth more in solv¬ 
ing our problem than dozens of ab¬ 
stract orations or newspaper articles. 
With us at present the getting of prop¬ 
erty, habits of industry, thrift, educa¬ 
tion, and high moral character is the 
wheat. All else is the chaff.” He spoke 
feelingly of che danger of the false edu¬ 
cational methods that deadened the 
sympathy of the boy or girl for the 
manner by which the parents had 
earned a livelihood, and their disin¬ 
clination to dignify the common occu¬ 
pations by putting brains into them 
and character behind them. 

He said that no one could shut his 
eyes to the seriousness of the condi¬ 
tions which confronted the colored race 
in this country, and that these condi¬ 
tions were serious for the white man 
and serious for the black pan. On the 
other hand, he remarked, no man or 
race could lift up in the slightest de¬ 
gree the meanest member of another 
race without that man or that race be¬ 
ing broadened and strengthened and 
made more happy. 

WHERE HOPE FOR THE RACE LIES 

“When I am asked as to the pros¬ 
pects of the race,” he said in conclu¬ 
sion, “I put this question and I put it 
here tonight with renewed emphasis: 


Can there be found anywhere in Amer¬ 
ica any considerable number of men of 
my race who have received thorough 
education of head, of heart and of 
hand, who have in any manner dis¬ 
graced themselves or become crimin¬ 
als? So iong as this threefold educa¬ 
tion continues to make men of our 
race instead of brutes I shall have the 
strongest hope for the future. No set 
of people ever had a greater opportu¬ 
nity to lift themselves up, and at the 
same time render a service to a weak 
race than is before the white people of 
America today. 

-——o- 

SHALL WE DRAW THiE COLOR 
LINE ON BOOKER T. WASH¬ 
INGTON? 

Is the question now agitating the minds 
of the members of the University Club. 
These people want Prof Washington to 
read a paper at their monthly banquet 
without sharing the banquet. How to 
get his information and the honor of 
his presence at their club without ac¬ 
cording him the respect due a great 
American citizen, is what is worrying 
the club. It is the position of a high¬ 
wayman who insists upon relieving a 
stranger of his pocket book without a 
formal introduction. These gentlemen 
ought to be manly. If Prof. Washing¬ 
ton is unfit to be entertained at their 
banquet, he is certainly unfit fo read 
a paper before the club. Another thing 
these gentlemen ought to know, and that 
is this: While the club may honor itself 
by entertaining Prof. Washington, it can 
bestow upon him no honor that he has 
not already received. Why some people 
will use every opportunity to make a 
cheap exhibition of themselves is hard 
for a man of average intelligence to un¬ 
derstand. Mr. Washington dined with 
our great President, but no negro has 
called upon the President’s daughter. 
Baimacker dined with President Jeffer¬ 
son, but no negro ever called upon Jef¬ 
ferson’s female relatives. What on earth 
will become of these negro haters? Guess 
they will insult President Roosevelt 
when he conies out here, as those white 
hoodlums did in Memphis, Tenn., a few 
weeks ago. What a disgusting spectacle 
these people are making of themselves! 


NO SPITE AGAINST PREACHERS 
Rev. Anderson, we regret to say v took 
offense at the mention of his name in 
connection with the late city campaign 
by this journal. We regret to know 
that he took offense, and also regret 
that we found it necessary to mention 
his name as taking part in ward poli¬ 
tics. At a meeting called by the chair¬ 
man of the Republican city central com¬ 
mittee for consultation with the colored 


ward bosses, Rev. Anderson was there 
and made a speech, which he had a 
right to do, if he so desired. In the 
course of his remarks he said that “the 
campaign reminded him of a Baptist 
church in what is known as a rough 
house.” In the midst of the trouble, 
lie said, all of the deacons prayed; one 
of whom said, “Lord,' come, and come 
now, and come yourself; don’t send 
your son, for I don’t like to deal with 
children.” Now, we love Rev. Ander¬ 
son, and thought he made a mistake in 
reciting this prayer at that meeting of 
ward bosses and six-bits Heelers. We 
thought of the good work he has done, 
of his great commission, “Go ye into 
all the world and preach my gospel to 
every creature. * * * Say to the 

weary and worn, ‘Comf. unto me all -ye 
that labor and are heavy laden and I 
will give you rest.’ ” Oh,' how this rush¬ 
ing world needs rest! Tired men and 
women are committing suicide every 
day for want of this rest—the rest that 
the minister is commissioned to offer 
them. Look at the deadfalls with their 
many trapdoors through which the dear 
young men and women are falling to 
rise no more. What a work for the min¬ 
ister to do! JTa.w great is his reward! 
While the soulsfof men are dying, how 
can the good man with this great com¬ 
mission, turn aside to attend a common 
ward political meeting, and honor it 
with a speech? If we criticise ministers 
we do so with regret, but do so be¬ 
cause we love them. The Liberator is 
a great Christian journal. Its only 
ambition is to dispel ignorance, and^ thus 
make men happier. Our advice to the 
young men is, be manly and self-reliant. 
Don’t rush into politics because your 
preacher is advertised to speak at the 
club meeting. The editor of this jour- 
, nal was at the aforesaid political meet¬ 
ing and listened prayerfully to its pro¬ 
ceedings. The end.

BOOKER T. WASHINGTON, 

Who .will address the citizens of Los 
Angeles at Simpson’s Auditorium Jan¬ 
uary 3rd, 1903._ 

As an educator and not as a politi¬ 
cian, I strive in every honorable and ra¬ 
tional way to encourage the wise and 
enduring progress of my people; for, 
if all inspiration and hope of reward 
is to be denied them, they will be de¬ 
prived of one of the greatest incentives 
to intelligence, industry and righteous¬ 
ness. On the other hand, if they are 
encouraged in sensible and conservative 
directions they will grow year by year 
into contentedness and usefulness. 

(Signed) 

Booker T. Washington. 
PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSE¬ 
VELT. 

I cannot consent to take the position 
that the door of hope, the door of op¬ 
portunity, is to be shut upon any good 
man, no matter how worthy, purely 
upon the ground of race or color. Such 
an attitude would, according to my 
convictions, be fundamentally wrong. 

Theodore Roosevelt, 

These inspiring words “will go sound¬ 
ing down the ages” when the Tillmans 
shall have been forgotten. 


We have now at the head of this na¬ 
tion a man with the courage of his ^con¬ 
victions—a statesman not a politician. 
As President he knows no North, no 
South, no East, no West, no white, no 
black, but one country, one common 
citizenship with the watchword, “Merit 
shall be rewarded.” The fact that Pres¬ 
ident Roosevelt and Prof. Booker T. 
Washington said practically the same 
thing, on the same day, touching the 
same question, is a very striking coinci¬ 
dence. 


Prof. Washington says: “If all in¬ 
spiration and hope of reward is to he 
denied them, they will be deprived of 
one of the greatest incentives to intelli¬ 
gence, industry, and righteousness.” 

President Roosevelt says: _ “I can¬ 
not consent to take the position that 
the door of hope, the door of oppor¬ 
tunity, is to be shut upon any good man, 
no matter how worthy, purely upon the 
grounds of race or color.”
