PRESIDENT TAFT’S APPOINT¬ 
MENT OF AN ASSOCIATE 
OF THE SUPREME COURT 

The prominent mention of the 
name of Judge Hook of Kansas, 
for an Associate Justice of the 
U. S. Supreme Court by President 
Taft brought many protestations 
against his appointment. He 
was able to overcome all but one 
and that was the decision he 
rendered in the Oklahoma case 
of McCabe vs. Atchinson, To¬ 
peka and Santa Fe R. R. and 
brought to the attention of the 
President by the New England 
Suffrage League, an organization 
of colored people. 

This decision showed that in 
a case involving “Jim Crow” legis¬ 
lation he fell a victim to race pre¬ 
judice and in the exercise of his 
powers as a judicial officer “was 
weighed and found wanting.” 

The action of the President in 
not presenting his name, aside from 
political reasons, brings to the sur¬ 
face that side of American manhood 
which stands for the perpetuation 
of this Republic. 

This is demonstrated every year 
by its citizens in the manner in 
which they esteem and reverence 
the memory of men who stood 
as the champion for the rights, 
not alone of the powerful but made 
their life work prominent in seeking 
civil protection for the humblest, 
without regard to race or creed. 

Such men have become immortal 
and in spite of out breaks 
of race prejudice whereby a man 
may become for a day notorious, 
our appreciation of manhood cause 
such a man to be soon forgotten 
in our efforts to attain the place 
where “we would do unto others 
as we would have them do unto 
us.” 

The American Negro is no less 
proud of Andrew Jackson, “Old 
Hickory”, Charles Sumner, Abra¬ 
ham Lincoln and other of our 
statesmen that have stood for 
the bringing about of such noble 
conditions. 

To these add the memory of men 
such as John Brown, William Lloyd 
Garrison, Wendell Phillips and 
others whose memories stand out 


prominent before the American 
people because of their fight for 
freedom of the oppressed, 
noble emulation. 

We ca n n o t understand 
why so man y m e n lose 
the golden opportunity of bringing 
to themselves the greatest presonal 
satisfaction of a well spent life 
in efforts of upholding the rights of 
all which brings to it the con¬ 
fidence and praise of all who 
are observers. 

What is true of the individual 
is also true of a set of individuals 
entrusted with power to govern. 

And if they, like our present 
Good Government administration, 
are to use the power in denying 
rights to a part of the citizens by 
a resort to race prejudice their 
days in control will be short.

cause. There are hundreds of small 
children growing up in the city 
streets because their mothers find 
it necessary to go out and earn a 
part of the family support. If 
the race is to be made secure for 
the future, our boys and girls of 
to-day must be reared in the midst 
of the best possible environments. 
The business of making men and 
women should engage our first 
attention. Make pure and heath¬ 
ful the atmosphere in which our 
boys and girls live and move 
during the first twenty years of 
their lives and you will have citi¬ 
zens that will make safe any state. 
Men and women are made, they 
don't grow. They are not the 
products of money but of love and 
care. Let everybody turn out and 
build for the future by rasing

WESLEY CHAPEL NOTES 


The morning services were the 
most soul stirring ever witnessed. 
The pastor was at his best which 
of course seems always the case 
with him. Taking for his text: 
“Moses in touch with God” he 
showed the wonderful power Moses 
received through that Divine 
touch. By that same touch Mar¬ 
tin Luther brought about the great 
reformation, and the Wesleys gave 
the world the great M. E. church 
He told how when Moody and 
Sankey were traveling in Scotland 
they saw standing by a gypsy 
wagon, a gypsy boy. Approaching 
him, they touched his head. That 
boy is the great evangelist Gypsy 


Smith. In a manner that touched 
men’s souls he told the members 
of his congregation that they held 
in their hands precious boys and 
girls who were not only to be 
the men and women of the future 
but possessed immortal souls to 
be saved or lost. He warned them 
against the awful mistake of sacri¬ 
ficing their children for money 
to go into society. 

THE DOUGLASS MEMORIAL 


The memorial services held in 
honor of Frederick Douglass were 
attended by an audience that filled 
the main auditorium. The 
speeches were of a high order. 
The address by Prof. Easton 
was exceptionally fine. Attorney 
Nash delivered a splendid address. 
He spoke in a deliberate conversa¬ 
tional tone and made a telling 
speech. While his style does not 
appeal to the emotional side of 
colored audiences, his arguments 
are always wholesome. 

RECEPTION TO SISTER LEWIS 


The reception tendered Sister 
Dollie Lewis by the churches of 
the city was a beautiful token of 
respect, for the services she has 
rendered them. The reception 
was attended by a big crowd. 

Addresses by Revs. Anderson, 
Tillman, Byers, Mucker and Prince 
The churches represented were the 
New Hope Baptist, the A. M. E. 
Zion, Wesley Chapel, the A. M. 
E. Church, Pasadena. At the 
close of the exercises refreshments 
were served. Sister Lewis was the 
recipient of many valuable pre¬ 
sents. The Pasadena converts 
presented her a handsome gown. 

Sister Lewis left last Thursday 
for her home in Kentucky with the 
love and respect of all. 

THE LYCEUM’S IMPORTANT 
MEETING 

Rev. E. W. Kenchin’s appearance 
at the Lyceum last Sunday attract¬ 
ed a fine audience. He delivered 
an address that was brim full of 
hope, and encouragement. It 
was a wonderful address so en¬ 


nobling, so uplifting. It was a 
blessing to all who had the good 
fortune to hear him, and especial 
inducement to the members of 
the Lyceum to press onward with 
renewed hope and vigor. 

The messrs. Mackie of Sacra¬ 
mento and Attorney Barnette of 
this city made excellent short talks 
that were well received. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


Mr. Clarence Bailey one of our 
bright young men was a pleasant 
caller at our office this week. 
It is always a pleasure to have the 
young men call and see us. 


Mr. C. W. Holden who has been 
confined to his home for several 
weeks is out again. Mr. Holden 
is a valuable member of the com¬ 
munity. 


Sister Dollie Lewis accompanied 
Madams Miller, Goodlow and son 
were visitors at the home of the 
editor and Mrs. Edmonds of Saw- 
telle Tuesday. In company with 
the editor and Mrs. Edmonds 
Sister Lewis and Mrs. Miller visited 
the Armacost nursuries and saw 
for the first time an artificial 
rain. It was a real genuine storm 
produced by forcing water through 
a net work of overhead punctured 
pipes. After the walk 
among flowers and country homes 
dinner was served by Mrs. Ida 
Edmonds Elgin. 


A RECEPTION TO MRS. WALK¬ 
ER 


The ladies day nursery tendered 
Mrs. Eugene Walker their presi¬ 
dent a splendid reception. Sup¬ 
ported by a number of our farseeing 
thoughtful women, she has labored 
unselfishly for several years to 
establish a day nursery. There 
is now and has been for a number 
of years a crying need for a day 
nursery where the little children

of many of our working women 
can be properly cared for, while 
their mothers are out earning a 
living. The most urgent need 
among our people in the city to¬ 
day, is a dAy nursery. 

As a token of their appreciation 
for the noble service Mrs. Walker 
is rendering the children of the 
city the reception was tendered 
her. 


Mr. C. H. Dougherty, the butcher 
and Mrs. A. M. Brown are both 
on the sick list. We hope soon 
to report their recovery. 

ATTORNEY McDOWELL 


Attorney McDowell in an ad¬ 
dress Sunday afternoon warned the 
colored peolpe against the danger 
of permitting their rights as citi¬ 
zens to be infringed upon without 
making some kind of a protest. 

He recited several incidences 
where intelligent and persistent 
opposition had defeated harmful 
measures. 

The colored people he said did 
not display enough manliness in 
facing these barbarous customs 
which injure both races by humiliat¬ 
ing one and creating a false pride 
in the other. He repeated the 
statements of two prominent men 
one of whom was a southerner in 
which both claimed that race pre¬ 
judice would not be near so great 
if the colored people would show 
a disposition to fight it at every 
turn. 

In speaking of the County hos¬ 
pital affair Attorney McDowell 
said that the fight must not cease 
until the nurse training depart¬ 
ment of the hospital an institu¬ 
tion that is supported by the tax 
payers of the county, without re¬ 
gard to race or color be opened 
to all.
