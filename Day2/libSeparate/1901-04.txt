Are Colored Delegates to be 
Let In? 


Shall Colored Wowen be given the 
Consideration due Women? 


Mrs. Variel Says No. 


Mrs. Sterry Makes a Strong Plea for Justice. 


One of the most important meetings 
of the club year was held Monday 
afternoon, March 25, at the Ebell Club 
house, when the parliamentary and de¬ 
bating section had its report day. A 
debate was held on the subject, just 
now being considered by women’s 
clubs all over the country, “Would the 
admission of colored delegates to the 
National Federation be detrimental to 
club life?” 

The meeting was called to order at 
2:30 p. m., Mrs. C. N. Flint in the 
chair. Mrs. William James Chick sang 
Bradsky’s “Thou Art Mine All,” after 
which the debate was opened by Mrs. 
C. N. Sterry, who spoke in part as fol¬ 
lows: 

“We have taken in mock debate a 
phase of the gravest question in the 
national life of America, and the time 
given me is so limited that I dare not 
stop even to closely define my premises. 
The youngest among you, however is 
not too young to know the general sit¬ 
uation. Thirty-six years ago 3,000,000 
slaves were emancipated. A beneficient 
government gave them their freedom— 
and nothing more. It withdrew them 
from the only support and protection 
they had ever known, and in so doing 
beggared the only m^n who understood 
them, and who should have been their 
real friends. A few years later the 
would-be friends of the negro thrust 
into his ignorant, untried hands the 
ballot. The history of the ballot you 
all know, and I want to interject the 


remark that, ignorant and untried as 
the negro was, he has never greatly 
misused the trust. The question of en¬ 
franchisement, however, that is such 
a burning question of the day, I may 
not stop to discuss. 

“The women of America are today 
largely engrossed in clubs. You are 
none of you so young that you cannot 
recall the history of club life. It be¬ 
gan by little knots of women in com¬ 
munities drawing together for mutual 
companionship and enlightenment, and 
proved so pleasant and beneficial that 
clubs multiplied all over the -and. Then 
the idea took possession of the women 
that if they derived benefit from their 
own clubs, they would derive still 
greater benefit if the different clubs 
could meet, exchanging ideas and ex¬ 
periences, and gathering up the ac¬ 
cumulated wisdom of all. 

“Women, while professing to hate, 
indulge in more cant than men. Men 
organize clubs frankly and honestly 
for their own pleasure and their own 
benefit, while there is not a woman’s 
club in the land that has not been or¬ 
ganized for the sole purpose of uplift¬ 
ing humanity. Much of the time that 
used to be applied to domestic matters 
is used for club life, and we have jus¬ 
tified ourselves by claiming that we 
are broader and better women, with 
higher ideals, and that club life ulti¬ 
mately redounds to the benefit of the 
home. If this is true of white women, 
why should not be it true of colored 
women? If we, with so much greater 
advantages and so much more favor¬ 
able environment, find it beneficial to 
gather together from all parts of the 
land, to exchange experiences and 
drink from the general fount of knowl¬ 
edge, is it not logical that these women 
of the colored race, who read, who 
think, who feel, who aspire, would also 
be benefited if they could gather from 
the same source the accumulated wis¬ 
dom of the clubs? And is it asking 
too much for these women that they 
may be permitted once in two years 
to bask in our effulgence? 


QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE. 

“We are dominated ,in this matter, 
whether we own it or not, by intense 
race prejudice, which is entertained 
toward no other race—as is evidenced 
by the keen race persecution that is 
going on today. I refer to the un¬ 
speakable horror of burning human 
beings at the stake. The culmination 
of these outrages occurred last when 
a woman—a colored woman, of 
course—suspected—mind you, sus¬ 
pected—of stealing $125, was taken out 
by the infuriated men of the village, 
shot, and the mutilated body thrown 
into the street. It Is a question now 
of principle that we have to consider, 
and I unhesitatingly affirm that the 
influence of the federation will not be 
injured by such colored delegates as 
will apply for admission. I will grant 
that all women easily contaminated 
will be likely to drop out of the asso¬ 
ciation, all women who know that it is 
their instinct to descend to the plane 
next below will wisely retire from 
federation. But influence and strength 
have not been measured by numbers, 
but by earnestness of purpose, and if 
the federation stands true to this great 
principle, it will not, it can not, lose 
in influence.” 

MRS. VARIEL OPPOSED. 

“I am opposed to the admission of 
colored delegates to federation. This 
does not mean that I have any feeling 
of antagonism toward colored women. 
But the colored woman is not the only 
otoe to be considered. I do not think 
that we, who have not lived in the 
South, can judge of the colored race 
and the question involved in this ques¬ 
tion for the women of the South. The 
white women of that section have done 
a great deal to elevate the colored 
race, and I think we should pay some 
deference to uieir opinion. 

SHE WOULD THE COLOR OF THE 
SKIN TEST. 

“The negro is black, we are white; 
shall we ever be able to mix socially? 
Custom says no. The law says no. Your 
own instinct says no . A beautiful

daughter of Walker, the Vinegar Bit¬ 
ters man, who, as you will remember, 
was a millionaire, married and gave 
birth to a black child. Her husband 
separated from her. But on his death¬ 
bed, her father confessed that she had 
black blood in her veins-that he had 
married a negro woman. Thus, aftei 
generations, the blood of the negro will 
tell of its origin.” 

What does the laws of God say on this 
subject.? Every time some consistent 
Christian or lover of right makes a plea 
for fair play for all, a great howl goes 
up from the negro haters, both North 
and South about social equality, inter¬ 
marriage, etc. 

About the 30,000 .illegitimate child¬ 
ren the white man of this country are 
bringing into the world every year by 
these black negro women they have 
nothing to say against. It is 
marriage they seem to dislike, not un¬ 
lawful cohabitation. There is not a 
half million pure blooded negros in 
this country who did the mixing. The 
negros have already had too much so¬ 
cial equality. 

Again Mrs. Variel quoted Prof. Starr 
of Chicago University to the effect that 
“Negroes form only two per cent of the 
population, but 16 per cent of the male 
prisoners in State institutions, and 34 
per cent of the female; while the ne¬ 
groes in Chicago form 1 1-3 per cent 
of the population and ten per cent of 
those arrested for offenses against the 
law. Prof. Starr further claims that 
the colored race is deteriorating phys¬ 
ically and dying out because of the 
moral conditions prevailing among its 
members.” 

What else could you expect of him, 
you want every avenue that leads to 
higher life closed to him? If the negro 
is dying out it is the result of his im¬ 
bibing too freely of the white man s 
civilization. 

Mrs. Variel “Thought the two races 
ought not to be expected to amalga¬ 
mate, although the matter would best 
be settled by leaving it to each State 
federation to decide for itself.” 

We have always been opposed to al- 
magamation, but had to yield to greater 
force. 

H YPOCRICY REBUKED — EXTEND 
THE GLAD HAND. 

Mrs. Edgar L. Swaine said that it 


appeared to her that a strange thing 
that a question of the kind presented to 
the club should ever be raised, espec¬ 
ially in an association of American wo¬ 
men and in a land which boasts of the 
freedom and equaity of all men as 
the fundamental principal of its Con¬ 
stitution. She declared her position in 
the words: “Let us put aside all petty 
prejudice of race and extend to the 
colored club women, when the time 
comes, the cordial hand of friendship. 

A DISTURBING ELEMENT. 

Mrs. A. W. Phelps, following Mrs. 
Swaine, expressed the opinion that the 
colored women would constitute a dis¬ 
turbing element, and that, for that 
reason, if for no other, they ought not 
to be admitted to federation. 

* * * * 

The question was then declared open 
for general debate, and several spoke 
upon it. Mrs. Babcock expressed her¬ 
self in favor of admission of the negro 
women delegates. Mrs. W. W. Stilson 
called to the mind of her hearers that 
not all colored women applying for ad¬ 
mission to federation would have the 
education of the New Era Club of Mas¬ 
sachusetts, from which a delegate was 
sent to the last federation meeting. 
The members of this club were all col¬ 
lege graduates, but few colored women 
clubs were likely to have members of 
any such standard of education, and no 
distinction, of course, could be made. 

Strange the college graduates had to 
fight two years before gaining admis¬ 
sion. 

“Mrs. Porter, ex-president of the 
Maine federation, thought that too 
much stress had been laid upon the 
social side of the question—that the 
chief work of women’s clubs should be 
humanitarian and educational. She pro¬ 
posed a remedy for differences in re¬ 
organization and the cutting out of 
delegates of individual clubs from the 
federation. This would leave the ques¬ 
tion to be settled by each State for 
itself.” 

A RINGING PLEA FOR JUSTICE AND 
FAIR PLAY. 

“Mrs. Sterry then closed the debate. 
She said the question of admitting del¬ 
egates sent by accredited clubs, to a 
general federation meeting, was not a 
case of “Do you want your daughter to 
marry a negro?” that race levee s were 


accused of wishing to introduce con¬ 
trary to the laws of nature—although 
she had heard that something similar 
sometimes took place even before eman¬ 
cipation—it was merely a question of 
lending a helping hand to the colored 
women, in order that they might have 
every chance at the advantages of the 
white clubs. As to the educational 
standing of delegates she would greatly 
dislike to see the college requirement 
introduced, for she feared that there 
were many members of the Ebell So¬ 
ciety and the Friday Morning Club 
who would drop out under such a re¬ 
quirement. She stigmatized the objec¬ 
tions to admission of the colored wo¬ 
men to federation as class prejudice, 
asking how many there were present 
who would hesitate to introduce to 
society an Indian girl, however un¬ 
educated, provided she were pretty 
and rich, and how many would dare 
to introduce a negro woman, however 
pretty and well educated she might be. 

What a pity it is that every member 
of the hated negro race can not read 
the above. How it would inspire them 
to nobler endeavors. It would say to 
them “be of good cheer” although the 
law is dead and the church is silent, 
we have yet a few friends left with 
courage enough to “speak out in the 
meeting.” 

After sadly surveying the field we 
had almost reached the conclusion that 
blind, unreasoning, unrelenting race 
hate and color prejudice had chased all 
of the friends of justice into silence 
and had blotted the remembrance of 
the Golden rule froni the American 
heart. Thank God it is not so. Though 
the Government has gone off after the 
golden calf and the church is bellowing 
“me to.” Religion is not a farce. There 
is yet some love for suffering human¬ 
ity at home as well as for that abroad. 
God be praised!

Has the White Man's Civiliza¬ 
tion Benefited the Negro? 

What He has Learned in the United States. 

The reports of fiendish brutality per¬ 
petrated upon the Negroes in the Unit¬ 
ed States, which daily shock the civil¬ 
ized world arouses in the minds of 
thoughtful persons the question as to 
whether the Negro has been benefited 
by white man’s civilization. Let’s see: 
when captured in Africa, the white man 
says lie was a pagan true to the ten¬ 
ets of his faith; he was strong of arm, 
tender of heart, faithful to a trust con¬ 
fided and morally pure. As long as 
slavery kept him near his primitive 
state he was a trustworthy, valuable 
friend of the white man. But just as 
soon as freedom gave him the benefit of 
thirty-five years of the white man’s 
civilization he is transformed into a 
beast. The Negro has adopted the white 
man’s religion, he reads the white 
man’s book and if he is the brute that 
the white man paints him to be it is 
the vfhite man’s fault. What the Ne¬ 
gro knows of rape, of incest, ante-natal 
murder, of adultery, fornication, hypoc¬ 
risy, fraud and other forms of lawless¬ 
ness of which he is charged, he learned 
them in the United States. In Africa 
the Negro does not assault the wives 
and daughters of white missionaries, 
who are completely at their mercy. 
There are thousands of them in the 
British West Indies and in many local¬ 
ities they vastly outnumber the whites 
and white women are never assaulted. 
Although there are millions of them in 
South America white women are not 
raped by them. 

Where Great Britain has established 
law and order and in the Catholic coun¬ 
tries the man who wrongs a negro girl 
has to answer for it, has to share the 
shame of her whom he drags down. 
Wherever the Negro is protected from 
the white man’s bestiality there is no 
lape racket. There is something I’adical- 
ly wrong with our moral code and the 
good name of the American people de¬ 
mands a change in the interest of right. 


We brag on the quality of our goods, 
and we know the prices are right. 
Cheap goods are dear at any price. 
Bring your next bill to us and let us 
prove it to you. J. D. Nash, Grocer. 


THE TEXAS HORROR. 

The burning of John Henderson at 
the stake at Corsicana, Texas,on March 
13th, is another of those fiendish out¬ 
rages that would make savages shud¬ 
der with horror. It is hard to believe 
that five thousand people claiming to 
be civilized would deliberately turn out 
to see a human being burned at the 
stake. This, tod, in a country that 
boasts of being a leader in the work 
of civilization. It is true, and an aw¬ 
ful truth it is. Burning at the stake 
is now the rule in this country and not 
the exception, when the accused is a 
negro. The question with those who 
have watched the progress of the mob, 
is, what will it do next? Will it not ac¬ 
tually resort to eating roasted “nig¬ 
ger?” That is about all that is left for 
it to do. The world is listening for its 
announcement. Sam Hose, an inno¬ 
cent negro, was burned at the stake in 
Georgia, and his baked liver was sold 
at 35 cents per slice. 


BRAVE WHITE MEN TIE A WOMAN, 
THEN SHOOT HER TO DEATH. 

NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 19.—A 
negro woman named Bailie Crutchfield, 
living near Rome, Smith county, was 
murdered Friday night by a mob. She 
was taken from her cabin and carried 
to the bridge over Round Lick creek. 
Her hands having been tied behind her, 
she was shot through the head and her 
body thrown into the creek. The cor¬ 
oner’s jury returned a verdict that she 
came to her death at the hands of un¬ 
known persons. She was suspected of 
taking $120 out of a pocketbook which 
had been lost. 

Let us suppose that the victim of this 
outrage was white and the brutes who 
murdered her were black. What would 
have been the result? They would have 
been burned at the stake in the pres¬ 
ence of the women and children of 
Smith and surrounding counties long 
ago. Colored men, what are you going 
to do?

THE OLD RAPE RACKET PLAYING 
OUT. 


At Tiptonville, Tenn., a few days ago 
a white jury, after hearing the evi¬ 
dence in the trial of a negro charged 
with raping a young white woman, 
could not agree to hang him, as there 
is no law in that state to hang both. 
A mob promptly hanged the negro. 
This case is self-explanatory and shows 
why negroes charged with raping white 
women are not given trials by jury. 

• Honest white men are not willing to 
inflict the death penalty upon Negroes 
for committing rape when the evidence 
submitted shows that rape has not been 
committed. Ninety-nine out of every 
hundred of the so-called rape cases 
would meet the same fate if tried by 
juries of honest men. Nobody knows 
this better than these lawless mobs. If 
every so-called rape case was tried ac¬ 
cording to law, this old worn-out rape 
dodge would be numbered with the lost 
arts.

THE NEGRO MUST DEFEND HIM¬ 
SELF — JUDGE CHAMPIONS A 

NEGRO. 

WICHITA,Kas.,March 16Twoyears 
ago, at Enid, O. T., a mob of white 
men attaced a lot of negroes who were 
innocently enjoying a cakewalk. Sev¬ 
eral white men and one negro were 
arrested. On trial all the white men 
were discharged, and Federal Judge 
John L. McAtee, who is also territorial 
judge, discharged the negro on his own 
motion. He indignantly addressed the 
jury today, saying: “I say to the col¬ 
ored men, defend your race. If the 
laws are not sufficient the god of na¬ 
ture has placed in your hearts the con¬ 
scious right to protect yourselves, and 
while I sit on the bench, if white juries 
cannot reach white offenders,black men 
shall not be punished by me if they 
defend themselves.” 

Right, judge! White juries are get¬ 
ting mighty slow about punishing 
white men for crimes committed 
against negroes; in many states such 
a thing is unknown. 

The negro has made the mistake of 
putting too high a value on life; as 
soon as he gets over this, there will 
be less of them lynched. We have 
never known a negro to be hanged who 
had the manhood to pump lead into the 
mob, and we know scores of them 
who have tried it with success. It is 
better for civilization, better for the 
white people, better for the country, 
and certainly better for the negro that 
10,000 of them die in their own blood 
defending themselves than have one 
burned at the stake.

The Independents Will Win. 

The municipal campaign in Pasadena 
clcsed on the 31st with the chances in 
favoi* of the independent ticket. Dur¬ 
ing the last few days of the campaign 
the tide set in towards the independ¬ 
ent ticket and everything points to its 
overwhelming election, with the excep¬ 
tion of councilman at large. It looks 
as if Mr. C. C. Reynolds will pull 
through, as he is very popular. This 
is why he was lassoed by the non-par¬ 
tisans, they early discovering that their 
ticket was entirely too “Weighty.” 
Personally, Mr. Wright is a good man 
and is well liked, but it is the old push 
that is dodging behind him that is 
stampeding the voters from his camp 
Among his supporters are many good 
men—like the Simons brothersfi for 
instance, who, after making a confes¬ 
sion of faith, joined the wrong church. 
Mr. Lacey, who has been tried and not 
found wanting, has behind him and his 


f 


ticket the great body of church going 
people, augmented by laboring men of 
every class, who have always found in 
him a friend. The colored voters have 
endorsed the independent ticket. They 
are by the non-partisan ticket like the 
Irishman who had had some trouble 
with a yellow jacket, fled on meeting 
an innocent boy that was rolling a 
ball on the ground, saying as he ran, 
“You have changer your jacket, but I 
know you now.” They have had some 
grevious engagements, that old push, 
and they say as between the devil and 
the push they would take the devil. 
The independent has in it every ele¬ 
ment of strength .and is sure to win. 
For want of space we give only two cf 
its personnels. 


--o- 

Mr. W, S. Lacey, our candidate for 
Mayor, was born at Laeeyville, Wyo¬ 
ming county, Pa., March 7, 1851. He 
served a regular apprenticeship at the 
carpenter’s trade. Then he and a 
brother-in-law carried on a contracting 
and building business and a planing 
mill at Binghamton, N. Y., for twelve 
years. His father served in the war 
for the Union. Mr. Lacey came to Pas¬ 
adena in 1886, and engaged in business 
as a building contractor. Seven years 
ago he was called into the city’s ser¬ 
vice, and the simple fact that $570,000 
of the people’s cash has been handled 
by him with all the efficiency and clean 
record of a first-class bank,is a voucher 
for his business ability and integrity. 
Also he has managed our police de¬ 
partment for five years with a degree 
of tact, skill and success that has put 
Pasadena in the very front rank as to 
that feature of her public service. And 
as the News said a year ago, “That is 
the kind of a man the politicians want 
to turn out of office.” We advise 
them not to do too much bragging be¬ 
fore the voters are heard from. 


Mr. J. P. Chaffin, who is our candi¬ 
date for councilman from the Second 
ward, is a native of the state of Maine. 
He was born in 1848 at the town of 
Naples, and passed his boyhood days 
amid the rigors of that northern clime. 
When a boy he worked on the farm 
during the summer and went to school 
winters. He afterward was engaged in 
manufacturing, and for a longtime had 


charge of a large New England manu¬ 
factory. Finding the work too confin¬ 
ing he was forced to give it up, and 
then he became a traveling salesman 
for a popular piano manufacturer. 

He was also one of the directors of 
the American Manufacturing Com¬ 
pany; also secretary of the same till 
he resigned to come to California. For 
some years he was engaged in the real 
estate business in Waltham, Massa¬ 
chusetts, but he was obliged to seek a 
milder climate on account of the health 
£>f one of his sons. Mr. Chaffin with 
his family (wife and three crildren) 
came to Pasadena in 1895, where they 
have since resided. He is now success¬ 
fully engaged in the real estate busi¬ 
ness with two sons. 

Nothing shows the estimation in 
which he was held by his fellow citi¬ 
zens better than the fact that they ten¬ 
dered him a reception attended by the 
mayor and city council of Waltham, 
just before be left.

TOO MUCH FREEDOM. 

America is indeed the freest country 
in the world for white men. They are 
so free that they not only commit mur¬ 
der as a pastime, but kill themselves 
by way of exchange. They make laws, 
then trample them under foot. They 
elect governors, then tell the world that 
the governors elected are too corrupt 
to execute the laws. They organize 
courts, then treat the Judges with con¬ 
tempt. They empanel juries, then mur¬ 
der the accused in their presence, say¬ 
ing in effect that juries composed of 
their fellow-citizens are scoundrels that 
cannot be trusted. They make no law 
that they feel bound to obey; take no 
oath they feel bound to respect. To 
force them to obey their own self-made 
laws would be to curtail their freedom; 
this no party dare attempt in this free 
country, hence the inability of govern¬ 
ment, either State or national, to inter¬ 
fere with mobs. 

Free government is a failure. The 
fact that this government cannot pro¬ 
tect its citizens from the lawless ele¬ 
ment of its population is an admission 
of the supremacy’ of the mob. Law and 
order have surrendered to brute force. 
The white man is his own burden; 
what will he do with himself?

LOCATION. 

The above church stands on a lot 
76x338 feet, corner of East Sixth street 
and Maple avenue, with electric cars 
running by front in Maple avenue. The 
parsonage stands on the rear end of 
the lot and fronts Sixth street. It is 
four short blocks southeast of the cus¬ 
tom house and only five blocks from 
the business center of the city, and is 
the most centrally located church 
property and only corner lot owned by 
any of the colored churches. 

BRIEF HISTORY. 

The church was organized about 
nine years ago. Rev. Tubbs (white) 
was its first pastor. During his pas¬ 
torate the heroic little band banked 


several hundred dollars for the pur¬ 
chase of a lot. 

Rev. D. Mucker next came to the pas¬ 
torate. During his efficient labor many 
were added to the church and a lot 
was purchased. By the churches of 
the Los Angeles District* M. E. church 
donating $700 and the Church Exten¬ 
sion Society giving $500, the heroic, 
self-sacrificing people erected the 
above edifice. 

A GLORIOUS VICTORY. 

Rev. F. L. Donohoo came to the pas¬ 
torate about two years ago. With his 
wise official board and the loyal mem¬ 
bership they have scored a glorious 
Victory; paid off all indebtedness of 
some $800 or more and dedicated the 
church. 

W. H. M. SOCIETY. 

Through the efforts of Mrs. Donohoo 
and others an auxiliary of the W. H. 
M. Society was organized. It held its 
first anniversary March 24 last. The 
report showed much good being done 
by this little band of noble women. 

THE LEAGUES. 

The Epwortn League Chapter, with 
J. A. Jackson, Esq., president, and the 
well officered departments, is doing 
the best work among the young people 
in its history. The Junior League un¬ 
der the superintendency of Miss A. L. 


Cobb is doing finely. 

SUNDAY SCHOOL. 

Mr. W. F. Henderson as superintend¬ 
ent and the efficient staff of teachers 
and officers can boast of the finest Sun¬ 
day School, doing the most thorough 
work in the history of the charge. 

THE CHOIR. 

Is under the management of Mr. W. F. 
Henderson, with Miss Katie Bradly at 
the organ. Despite the fact that the 
choir is very young in its organization 
it is rapidly making its way to front 
place among the choirs of the city. 

THE BENEVOLENT SOCIETY. 

With Mr. A. S. Eagle holding the 
gavel, now numbers more than fifty 
members, with a snug little “mest 
egg” in its treasury, and is able to pay 
off its beneficiaries. The church and 
all the auxiliaries are canstantly re¬ 
ceiving many good members. 


THE FIRST MILE-STONE IS PASSED 

In its battle for the advancement of 
human progress, broader citizenship 
and larger political independence, The 
Liberator has passed its first mile¬ 
stone. And, like a young athlete, it is 
stronger for the battle it has fought, 
with the experience that is gained by 
combat it sets out for the second with 
increased determination to do its full 
share in the struggle for the enforce¬ 
ment of the laws and equal rights for 
all. Those who disapproved the course 
persued by The Liberator have very 
largely given us credit with being be¬ 
ing actuated by pure motives. An hon¬ 
est man who differs with his neigh¬ 
bors could ask no more. The estima¬ 
tion in which The Liberator is held 
by the colored citizens and the public 
generally is attested by the liberal sup¬ 
port it has and is still receiving. Al¬ 
though it has no solicitors, its sub¬ 
scription list grows staedily. It is a 
fearless champion of right.

Jarrett E. Edwards, the pastor of 
Stevens A. M. E. Church, was born in 
South Carolina. He was educated at 
Howard University, Washington, D. C., 
graduating May 6th, 1881; he labored, 
teaching school and preaching in Texas 
twelve years and six moths. He has 
been engaged in the ministry in Cali¬ 
fornia seven and a half years. He has 
always been a successful pastor, build¬ 
ing rip the work temporally and spirit¬ 
ually. His services and life have been 
such that he would be welcomed back 
to any charge that he has ever filled. 
He is one of the few ministers in his 
denomination who usually serves the 
time limit in a charge. He is now in 
his third year in Los Angeles and 
seems to grow continually in favor 
with the people, without regard to 
church or denomination. 

He has been a delegate to five gen¬ 
eral conferences of the church and has 
assisted in the election of every living 
bishop of his church save one, Bishop 
H. M. Turner, who was elected before 
Rev. Edwards became an itinerant 
minister. He is now delegate-elect to 
the Ecumenical Council of Methodism, 
which meets in London in September, 
1901. 

Rev. Edwards has an interesting 
family, wife and three children. His 
wife has always been of great help to 
him in his work, until her sad afflic¬ 
tion of paralysis more than five years 
ago forced her to give up. The work 


h.e is doing for the uplifting of the 
people is felt and appreciated by all.

THE COLORED BUSINESS MEN OF 
PASADENA. 

With a colored population of nearly 
500 Pasadena can boast of two neat and 
well attended colored churches and 
a number of colored business men who 
are making steady progress. 

* * * * 

Mr. T, B. Walker, the well known 
confectioner and employment agent, is 
building up a good business and is 
making a place for himself among the 
business men of Pasadena. He has 
proved himself to be reliable and en¬ 
joys the confidence of his neighbors. 

* * * * 

Mr. W. C. Dent, proprietor of the 
Cosmopolitan tonsorial parlors on Fair 
Oaks avenue, by first class work and 
close attention to business, has built up 
a large trade. He keeps a neat, orderly 
place, which is patronized by the best 
people of the city. Mr. Dent is secre¬ 
tary of the Friendship Baptist Church, 
superintendent of the Sunday school, 
and is doing much good in the cause 
of religion. 

:)e $ H: sft 

Mr. J. E. Lattimore, the coal, wood 
and hay dealer, is also making a place 
for himself in the business world. He 
has all the business he can handle,and 
enjoys the independence one derives 
from employing himself. 

* sis * * 

Mr. H. Boone, the blacksmith, is a 
shining example of what colored men 
can accomplish if they are willing to 


try to do something for themselves. 
He landed here several years ago with¬ 
out a dollar, and spent his first few 
weeks in answering advertisements for 
a blacksmith, only to be turned away 
as soon as the advertiser saw how large 
and black he was, the color of his skin 
was against him. While in this pre¬ 
dicament he ran across a blacksmith 
outfit for sale, which he bought on 
credit and set up for himself. He now 
owns his shop and fixtures, valued at 
$800 to $1000 and a neat two-story 
house, corner Fair Oaks avenue and 
Congress street, also a cottage fronting 
on Congress street, which he rents. 
The value of his property at a low es¬ 
timate is $2500. 

* * * * 

Mr. L. C. Chapman is the only colored 
shoemaker in the city, is a Georgian. 
With only the quality of his work to 
recommend him he has made himself 
a necessity. Hence he has all the work 
he can do. 

* * * * 

Mr. I. Hadley owns and operates a 
steam wood sawing plant and is doing 
well. He owns also a nice house and 
lot and is making solid progress. He 
will make his mark. 

* * * * 

Mr. J. C. Williams the carpenter and 
builder, owns valuable property in 
South Pasadena. He stands well among 
the men of his profession and business 
men generally. The fact that he has 
steady work and is often awarded con¬ 
tracts for building large residences is 
the best proof of his ability. 

* * * * 

Mr. William Prince is a large owner 
of real estate. His handsome residence 
on Vermont avenue is a credit to that 
popular thoroughfare. He has also 
what every man ought to have—a good 
wife and a lot of bright little boys and 
.girls of whom he is justly proud. 

* * * * 

Mr. J. J. Bunch, master of finance in 
the K. of P.'s, is also a popular leader 
and progressive young man. He has 
also a good wife, and a whole lot "of 
little Bunches. He is respected for his 
worth. 

* * * * 

Among the prominent young men 
whose names may be mentioned are 
Mr. Geo. D. Powell, the well read leader

and embodyment of independent 
thought; Mr. J. R. Harris, the trusty 
employe of J. D. Nash, the grocer; 
Messrs’ F. M. Prince, W. W. Oakman 
and the Holmes boys. There are others 
we cannot mention for want of space. 
Look for them next time. 

-o- 

MR. J. D. NASH. 

Mr. J. D. Nash, successor to Nash 
Bros., grocer, shows the same friend¬ 
ship for the colored race that has al¬ 
ways characterized that firm by the 
employment of colored help and adver¬ 
tising in colored newspapers. We have 
said time and again that the real 
friends of the race are those who give 
them a chance to earn money. No 
mercantile firm in Pasadena has shown 
so strong a desire to aid the colored 
race in a practical way as this firm. 
We have said, and say again, that 
every colored family in that city ought 
to show their appreciation by giving 
them the whole or part of their trade. 
They sell everything in their line and 
have the best delivery service in the 
city. If the colored people expect to 
have papers to fight their battles and 
manufacture public sentiment in the 
interest of fair play for themselves, 
they must own and support them by pa¬ 
tronizing such firms only as show a 
willingness to employ them and aid 
their enterprises. This is the key to 
the situation.

JUANITA OIL COMPANY. 

If you will mention that you saw 
this notice in The Liberator you may 
have a copy of the April bulletin free 
by sending a postal card to the JUAN- 
I TA OIL COMPANY, 175 North Spring 
street, Los Angeles, California. 

Juanita Oil Company’s well No. 1 on • 
last Tuesday was down 128 feet and 
still going down. For well No. 2 the 
company has a 56-foot derrick and a 
standard rig. The company has built 
a bunk house 16x40 feet for its men, 
and has a reading room and bathtub. 

J The men are paid full wages for 8 
hours work and are paid in gold coin 
every Saturday night. 

Casing for well No. 3 is on the 
ground. 


ITEMS OF LOCAI^ INTEREST. 

Mr. Charles A. Graves, of Rosamond, 
is in the city in the interest of his 
mines. He left at the office of Attorney 
G. Woodson Wickliffe, specimens of 
gold ore. He is the first and only col¬ 
ored postmaster ever appointed in the 
state. He was appointed by President 
Cleveland. 

* * * * 

Messrs. A. L. Tilton and G. S. Brown 
have returned from Sacramento. Mr. 
Tilton was sick most of the time dur¬ 
ing his stay at the .capital, but Mr. 
Brown’s stay was pleasant. All of the 
Southern swallows have not yet re¬ 
turned and there is likely to be a walk¬ 
ing match before all of the noses are 
counted. 

* * * * 

Mr. Jones, who recently paid $1800 
cash for his San Pedro street property 
is doing a rushing business. 

* * * * 

Mr. A. R. Wyehe has added two more 
lots to his city property. His holdings 
are now valued at $2,500. 

Among our new subscribers we are 
pleased to chronicle the names Messrs. 
Bellamy, J. H. Hereford, T. M. Mc¬ 
Clellan, H. Stricklin, W. J. Thompson, 
G. M. Warner, S. Alexander, Edward 
and Mesdames A. Bright, Carroll and 
Miss Sadie Brown. 

* * * * 

Mrs. Epp, an old lady, was seriously 
hurt through the criminal carelessness 
of a street car conductor a short time 
ago. Suit will be brought against the 
railroad company.

The so-called Social Clubs will

Dr. Garret, a dentist and graduate of 
Howard University, Washington, D. C., 
has settled in the city. Welcome, doc¬ 
tor; wish you much success. 

* * * * 

Rev. Chandler, who addressed a large 
crowd at the Y. M. C. A. on Sunday 
afternoon, acquitted himself splendid¬ 


ly. His address, in point of delivery 
and thought, has not been surpassed 
by any address of the Y. M. C. A. series 
and it received high praise. The Tab¬ 
ernacle choir furnished the music. 


Mrs. Campbell, formerly proprietor 
of the Barrows on Towne avenue, has 
removed to 125 Vine street, where she 
has opened the Ohio. 

The parents of Mrs. J. B. Loving will 
arrive in the city next week. They will 
probably reside here permanently.

EX-PRESIDENT HARRISON. 

The death of ex-President Harrison, 
which occurred several days ago, le- 
moves from the stage of action another 
distinguished American whose life add¬ 
ed to the luster of his country. He 
helped to make the history of the most 
eventful period in the nation s life. 
When right and wrong were struggling 
for the mastery, when freedom and 
slavery stood in deadly array, he made 
no compromise with wrong, but with 
might and main he fought in the ranks 
of those who battled for justice. He 
was an active member of that mighty 
host of stalwarts that made the name ot 
the Republican party an inspiration of 
hope to the oppressed of every land. 
But that party and the mighty host of 
which it was composed has passed 
away. Mr. Harrison was a great law¬ 
yer, a famous orator and like others of 
his contemporaries in death leaves no 
successor 


THE PHILADELPHIA SHOE STORE. 

- Mr. N. M. Livingston, manager o£ the 
Philadelphia Shoe Co., is no stranger 
to the citizens of Pasadena and vi¬ 
cinity. He was in the shoe business 
there several years ago and by hand¬ 
ling only first-class shoes his shoe 
store became one of the best patronized 
in the San Gabriel valley. Owing to 
his large interest in the shoe business 
in the East, he sold out and went there 
several years ago. He has returned to 
Pasadena to reside permanently an 
has opened a shoe store at 34 North 
Fair Oaks avenue, with a large s 
of ladies’, gents' and children s shoes. 
For fine footwear give him a call. H 
is an old shoe man, knows all about 
shoes and knows how to buy, that s 
the real secret of his success. The an¬ 
nouncement of his return guarantees 
the restoration of his old ti ade.__

OIL COMPANIES 


Among the multitude of oil com¬ 
panies being organized iq the pres¬ 
ent boom there is none that com¬ 
mends itself to the careful thinker 
more than the Juanita Oil Com¬ 
pany. Mr. B. A. Stephens, its pres 
ident and general manager, has 
Jieea in the oil business for the last 
'ten years, and has successfully 
floated half a dozen oil companies. 
He has put all his experience and 
wisdom of the years in the oil busi¬ 
ness into the Juanita Company, 
Its papers were very carefully 
drawn* Its lands were selected 
with the greatest care. It ha^ 
some of the finest leaseholds and 
fees simple in oil lands of any, com-- 
paoy in the state. The company 
has no secrets. Its business is 
done in the open. It courts th« 
closest scrutiny and strictest inves¬ 
tigation as to its organization, 
lands, and management Lte di¬ 
rectors are Los Atvgelea busineen 
men of standing and prominence, 

■ whose intelbgence, honesty and
