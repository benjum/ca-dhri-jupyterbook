WILL FIGHT TO A FINISH. WILL GIVE THE 
STATE TO WILSON RATHER THAN 
LET ROOSEVELT HAVE IT 


THE TAFT PLAN 


The California primary law pro¬ 
vides that the candidates for the 
Assembly and Senate selected in 
yesterday's primary, together with 
the hold-over Senators, shall meet 
at Sacramento on September 24 
and select the candidates for the 
party for the electoral college. 

This means that if a majority 
of the so-called Progressive can¬ 
didates are nominated . (which 
appears likely) the electors to 
be selected for the place in the 
column on the November ballot 
will be pledged to vote for Roose¬ 
velt. In the event that a majority 
of candidates from the straight 
Republican ranks are selected, 
Taft electors will be named. 

If the Taft. candidates are out¬ 
numbered it is the present plan 
to have them call a convention of 
their own in another part of the 
hall and select Presidential electors 
pledged to President Taft. Then 
the question will arise as to which 
set of candidates is entitled to the 
place on the ballot under the Re¬ 
publican party and legal proceed¬ 
ings will probably be brought to 
prevent the Secretary of State from 
placing the list selected by the Bull 
Moosers as “Republicans” on the 
official ballot. 

The claim will be made by the 
straight Republicans that the Pro¬ 
gressive party is a separate organi¬ 
zation and entirely outside the 
Republican party and had no right 
to represent themselves as Repub¬ 
licans at the primary election. 

If the question is carried to the 


courts and the Progressives win 
thousands of Republicans will pro¬ 
bably vote for Woodrow Wilson, 
the Democratic candidate for Presi¬ 
dent, in orefer to keep the State 
out of the Roosevelt column.

JOHN MITCHELL FOR WILSON 


Editor of Richmond Planet Advises 
Race and Colored South to 
Support Democrats and 
so Make Friends. 


Declaration Means There are 
Many Who Will Do the Same 

(Special Dispatch to the Star.) 

Richmond, Va., August 10— 
John Mitchell, editor of the Negro 
organ, the Planet, and one of the 
leading Negroes of this state, is 
out in a statement that he will' 
not have any dealings with and 
will give no comfort to the candi¬ 
dacy of Col. Roosevelt. Indi¬ 
vidually, he says, he will support 
Gov. Wilson for the presidency. 
Mitchell says that in an attempt 
to put a fire under President 
Taft Col. Roosevelt has started 
one under himself, which will not 
be extinguished so long as he lives, 
and that he will realize after the 
November election that he is not 
able to make the Negro race be¬ 
lieve that the moon is made of 
cheese. 

For many years Mitchell was 
an uncompromising champion of 
the Republican party, took a pro¬ 
minent part in politics and was 
easily the foremost Negro in the 


state. But he and the adminis¬ 
tration leaders had a row, and he 
has for a long time been making 
war on that element which said 
that organization meant political 
preferment for those who were in 
the actual control of the party. 
He did not take that view. He was 
then cast out of the councils, and 
in the last few years he has been* 
taking the position that the people 
of the south were and are the best 
friends of his people, and he has 
been preaching economy, attention 
to business, sobriety, hard work, 
self-respect and clean living for 
his people. 

Mitchell's declaration that he 
will vote for Wilson means that 
there are many of his race who 
will do the same, and it is a fact 
that there is an organization here 
which will make an effort to enter 
the democratic primaries and to 
vote for candidates for Congress—• 
a thing which none of them has 
ever before done. It is not yet 
settled that they can vote in the 
primaries, but they ask to be 
allowed to participate.

home today. He was born 74 
years ago, in Holly Springs, Miss. 

Church's wealth is estimated by 
Memphis bankers to exceed SI,000,- 
000. He owned valuable business 
property and over 350 residences 
in the city and several hundred 
acres of land near the city limits. 

Church began life on a cotton 
plantation. When old enough to 
work he was sold to the owner of 
a Mississippi River steamboat. 
His boyhood life was spent as a 
cabin boy on a boat that plied in 
and out of the harbor of Memphis. 

After the Civil War ended, 
Church left the river and secured 
a position with a wholesale mer¬ 
chant. From that he embarked 
into the saloon business. Then he 
began to buy real estate. 

Church was the only negro of 
prominence that ever subscribed 
to a fund to entertain the Con¬ 
federate veterans at their annual 
reunions. He did this when the 
first reunion was held in Memphis 
about fifteen years ago, giving

WHO IS WHO AMONG US? 

To the editor the Amsterdam News: 

It may seem strange to say it, 
yet it is true, there are a great 
number of our young men who can 
not tell anything of Crispus Attuchs, 
Toussaint L' Overture, and some 
others I could name. We can 
not blame these young men, as 
they never hear of the history 
of our race and its great leaders 
and statesmen. We have a great 
history, but it is kept from us 
by the white man, and we help 
him to hide it. Take for example 
Robert T. Cole who wrote “Events 
and Reflections." Every colored 
minister in this city received a copy 
and as yet have not expressed their 
opinion of his work, but the white 
people's criticism of the book is 
(in many respects this is a remark¬ 
able book, because its author tells 
the history of his people and breath¬ 
es their hopes and aspirations for 
the future). It is small wonder 
that we are ignorant of what is 
being done by the workers of the 
race of today and the ones gone 
by. Those who do know anything 


seem unwilling to impart the in¬ 
formation to our children. In the 
public library we find the Aby¬ 
ssinian's Bible and Ethiopian manu¬ 
script. We never hear our minis¬ 
ter speak of these things in the white 
Y. M. C. A. and churches the speak¬ 
er always bring up the life or 
event of the life of some great 
man of the race. We can not 
see or hear of our great men and 
until some white man puts them 
up before us. 

Paul L. Dunbar was put before 
us by a white man. Again we find 
Toussaint L'Overture, by Wen- 
del Phillips, and should be read 
by all Negroes. Below I give a 
list of men of the black race that 
we all should love and if our minis¬ 
ters and newspapers would put 
the work of each of these men be¬ 
fore us they would do the race a 
grand and noble good.

ture, Booker T. Washington, Paul

TAFT FAVORS MINGO SAN¬ 
DERS 


Job for Discharged Brownsville 
Colored Soldier—Congressman 

• Rodenburg Moves to Reinstate 
Those of Brownsville Regiment 
Who Were not Proven Guilty. 
For Sanders At Once. 


Washington, Aug. 3—By an 
executive order of President Taft 
Mingo Sanders, who was a sergeant 
of the Colored infantry regiment 
discharged from the Army without 
honor, when several companies of 
the regiment likewise were dis¬ 
charged for participation in the 
Brownsville riots, today became 
a messenger in the classified ser¬ 
vice and went to work at the 
Interior Department at $70 a 
month. 

Recently Sanders took part as a 
spellbinder in the Ohio primary 
fight between President Taft and 
Col. Roosevelt. 


Representative Rodenburg of 
Illinois said today he would intro¬ 
duce in the House next week a 
bill to reinstate Sanders in the 
Army and permit his retirement 
at once. When discharged, San¬ 
ders had served 26 years and after 
another year's service would have 
been entitled to retirement at two- 
thirds pay and allowances. 

Will Introduce Foraker Soldier Bill 

Later, Mr. Rodenburg says, he 
will introduce a bill for the rein¬ 
statement of all innocent soldiers, 
discharged for participation in the 
Brownsville riots. 

Roosevelt Begrudges Poor Out¬ 
raged Mingo Sanders Who 
Saved His Life the Belated Half— 
Justice Taft Willing to Give. 

Rehearses All the Wrong Taft Did 
at His Behest When Taft Re¬ 
pents of It—Mean and Low. 

The appointment by President 
Taft of Mingo Sanders, who was a 
sergeant of the colored infantry 
regiment discharged from the army 
for participation in the Browns¬ 
ville riots, as a messenge, led Col¬ 
onel Roosevelt to criticise the 
President sharply. Sanders took 
the stump in the Ohio primary 
fight between Colonel Roosevelt 
and President Taft. 

“In his report and recommenda¬ 
tions," said the colonel, “Mr. Taft 
explicitly stated that the veteran 
non-commissioned officers in charge 
of the battalion were of course 
more responsible for what had 
occured than the others, and no¬ 
thing has occurred since to alter 
the position of Sanders except his 
use by Mr. Taft's campaign man¬ 
agers in Ohio. In short, he was 
discharged by Mr. Taft's recom¬ 
mendation on his military record. 
He is reinstated under Mr. Taft 
on his political record. 

Roosevelt’s Mean Objection Makes 
Taft’s Act Shine Brighter.

leagues in his report as Secretary 
of War, from which I have quoted 
above, then his conduct needs no 
characterization by me. If he did 
tell the truth, then his reinstate¬ 
ment of Mingo Sanders in the 
public service is still less in need 
of any characterization by me/’

THE PECK IMMIGRATION 
SCHEME 

What has become of the African 
Immigration Scheme inaugurated 
by Rev. Peck, in connection with 
his fight for the bishopric? Al¬ 
though much was said, previous 
to his trip to Kansas City about 
inducing good Negroes to come 
to California, very little has been 
heard of the scheme since his 
return. 

It is said that the laboring mem¬ 
bers of the Afro-American Council 
furnished considerable money to 
maintain an immigration bureau 
at Kansas City. 

In view of the fact that neither 
Rev. Peck nor the Afro-American 
Council had any real estate to 
sell and that neither can furnish 
a days employment to colored 
people, who come here; it is puzzling 
to thoughtful people to understand 
their object of inducing laborers 
to come to this state.

Boston, Mass. 

The Democrats in this state 
adopted a primary law, which had 
passed the Virginia Legislature and 
which makes no discrimination in 
the matter of color, treating white 
and Colored men alike. If a 
Colored man will pledge himself 
to support the Democratic nomi¬ 
nees and the nominees in the local 
election, he can vote in the primary.

THE PASSING OF DISTIN¬ 
GUISHED NEGROES 


Mr. Samuel Coleridge Taylor, 
the world famous musical composer 
and singer, died in England on 
the 2nd. The death of Mr. Tay¬ 
lor removes from the stage of action 
one of the most distinguished men 
of this age and indicts an irreparable 
loss upon his race. As a matter 
of fact, when a composer like Mr. 
Taylor dies the whole world loses, 
for a great song writer sings in every 
tongue making the great heart 
of the world lighter by his song. 


That which lightens the human 
heart knows no race circum¬ 
scription; but is as universal in 
its beneficience as the sunlight. 

Like Dunbar, Mr. Taylor paid 
the price that genius exacted. 


A Distinguished Journalist Passes 

When the announcement was 
made that Edward W. Crosby, 
distinguished journalist and tele¬ 
graphic editor of the Buffalo 
Times, was dead, few people knew 
that he was a Negro. By force 
of his genius he secured his posi¬ 
tion in spite of his race identity. 
It was a case where ability sur¬ 
mounted race handicap. Mr. 
Crosby ever remained closely iden¬ 
tified with his race and lost no 
opportunity to create sentiment 
favorable for its advancement. 

The Late “Bob” Church 

Mr. Robert Church of Memphis, 
Tenn., a Negro millionaire whose 
death was announced a few days 
ago was indeed a remarkable man. 
His saloon business with its atten¬ 
dant evils made him the frequent 
subject of criticism by members 
of his race. But Mr. Church 
used the money that the whiskev 
drinking Negroes passed over his 
bar to buy land and erect homes 
for them. When he found that 
the Negroes were discriminated 
against in the public parks, ' he 
purchased land and laid out for 
them a beautiful park. He built 
them a magnificent theater and 
established for them a bank. 

This is another demonstration 
of the fact “that things of seeming 
evil prove sometimes a source of 
lasting good.” The money Mr. 
Church received from the Negroes 
for whiskey he created channels 
through which the Negroes earnings 
might flow back to them. Al¬ 
though in his money-making Mr. 
Church may have inflicted some 
ills upon his people, the good he 
has rendered them far out-balances 
the evil. As his life affected his 
race the balances are, doubtless, 
on the right side of the ledger. 


THE LIBERATOR'S CHOICE

We feel highly gratified with the 
result of the election. Eight of 
the candidates supported by this 
journal were handsomely indorsed 
by the voters. The Liberator’s 
entire judicial ticket was nomi¬ 


nated as follows:

SOUTHERN BRUTALITY 


The electrocution of Virginia 
Christian, the seventeen-year-old 
colored Virginia girl, blazes out 
in diamond light the brutal at¬ 
titude of the South toward her 
colored citizens. Had Virginia 
Christian been a white woman, 
instead of a colored girl, Southern 
chivalry would have waxed furious 
to save her sex and to save the 
State from the infamy of her being 
put to death by the State. But, 
instead, s mere slip of a girl, goaded 
to desperation, being made to feel 
the degradation of her unhappy 
lot, turned upon her mistress and 
killed her. Southern chivalry and 
sentiment, considering a colored 
woman a thing separate and apart 
simply for the gratification of the 
lust and domestic wants of her 
white lords, raised not a voice in 
her behalf. The unwritten law, 
the sanctity of the female sex, has 
no place in the code of ethics of 
the South when the female sex 
is neath a colored skin. The un¬ 
written law is no guardian angel 
for the lady of color. But such 
outrages by the State will arise 
again and again in future years to 
plague old Dixie. The unbridled 
passions of coming generations will 
not only not respect the colored wo¬ 
man, but it will take the easy step to 
a likewise wholesale debauchery 
of white women. 

In passing, too, it may be said 
that Northern sentiment, too, has 
been absolutely wanting in this

most recent Southern outrage. 
It has become callous not only to 
the wanton mob murders of colored 
men and women, but it now sits 
supinely by and sees a colored boy 
riddled by a mob’s bullets in one 
week and a colored girl electro¬

NEGRO LABOR THE BEST IN 
THE WORLD WHEN FAIRLY 
TREATED. 


Senator Newell Sanders of Ten¬ 
nessee recently appointed by Gov*. 
Hooper, is the wealthiest man in 
the South. Discussing labor and 
farming conditions in the South, 
he has the following to say about 
the Negro as a laborer: 

“There are a good many big 
cotton plantations in the South 
and there is money in cotton when 
the price goes to 10 cents a pound. 
Farmers in that part of the country 
are getting to be comfortably well 
off. Our soil is food or can be 
easily rehabilitated and we have 
the best class of laborers in the 


United States. Negroes are 
steadier and more faithful and 
willing than any other workers in 
the world. Politicians have mis¬ 
represented the blacks so long that 
fiction is now accepted as fact 
even among many southern people 
themselves. I have employed 
Negroes for thirty years and I 
know what I am talking about. 
But they must be fairly treated.”
