SOME WESTERN OBSERVATIONS 
From the Spring-field, Mass., Republican. 

South McAlester, I. T., November 
20, 1905.—The party which has accom¬ 
panied Booker T. Washington on his 
western tour reached this place Sun¬ 
day night, the 19th. Mr. Washington 
has been traveling and speaking since 
the 15th. He spoke at the opera house 
inOklahoma City on the morning of 
the 18th, and in Guthrie that same even¬ 
ing. Sunday he spoke at South McAl- 
ester and spent Monday morning in 
visiting the mining towns of the region. 
He will speak Monday night at Musko¬ 
gee, the capital of the Creek Nation, 
and will finish his tour at Fort Smith 
Tuesday evening. Everywhere Mr 
Washington's visit has aroused interest. 
There is a feeling among the more 
thoughtful members of the community, 
both white and black, that this is a crit¬ 
ical neriod in the history of the rela¬ 
tions of the races. J. H. Johnson, the 
secretary of the Chamber of Commerce 
at Oklahoma City, said as much in his 
address of welcome. “Mr. Washington,” 
he said, “is the man to whom the nation 
is looking to uplift his people. He comes 
to us at a critical time. There is noth¬ 
ing wrong with the colored race, except 
that it lacks confidence in itself. This 
confidence it will gain under wise lead¬ 
ership.” 

Oklahoma is border territory. It is 
a place where the North and South 
meet and mingle. It has no fixed tra¬ 
ditions in regard to Negroes. If prej¬ 
udice exists, it is of the northern rather 
than of the southern type. Many of the 
people who settled here came from Kan¬ 
sas and elsewhere in the North, and 
these people have had no disposition to 
deny the Negro any of the privileges 
that are granted to other citizens. The 
colored people have been encouraged to 
buy and own property. Their schools 
are equal to those of the white popula¬ 
tion, and there is no distinction in the 
distribution of the school taxes. But 
if there is no such prejudice against the 
Negro here as one meets> in the South, 
there is also not the same prejudice 
against work. Here every one wor ft . 
even the women. In Oklahoma and 
Indian Territory one meets women work¬ 
ing in all sorts of places. They have 
largely taken the places of Negro wait¬ 
ers in the hotels. They work as bar¬ 
bers and as clerks. They run elevators, 


and everywhere, as far as I can see, th v 
work well. If there is no special place 
for the Negro in the street cars and 
railway stations, there is also no special 
place set a^art for him in the nidustrial 
system. Everywhere he comes in di¬ 
rect competition with the most energetic 
and progressive people on the continent. 
The effect is in some ways surprising. 
The Negro population in Oklahoma City, 
at any rate, is more sober, earnest and 
less demonstrative than elsewhere. I 
was told uy a colored real estate dealer, 
J. D. Randolph, that at least 70 per 
cent of the Negro population in Okla¬ 
homa Citv owned their own homes. 
There seems to be no prejudice against 
Negro labor. On the contrary, in the 
mines about South McAlester Negro 
labor is preferred because ‘ Negroes do 
not make trouble,” as the Poles and 
Italians do. On the other hand, it is 
admitted that the Negro laborer is neith¬ 
er so steady nor so thirfty as the for¬ 
eign laborer with whom he comes in 
competition. As near as I can learn, the 
Negro has done best on the farm, where 
he owns and works, his own land and 
has a permanent stake in the country. 

There is no question about the suc¬ 
cess of the Negro farmer in Oklahoma. 
It was a Negro who raised the cotton 
which took the prize at the World’s Fair 
in Paris in 1900. This man’s name is 
Albert Smith. He owns 480 acres out¬ 
side of Oklahoma City, and is known 
as the “Negro cotton king.” At Guth¬ 
rie the editor of the local paper informed 
me that he had met a Negro farmer a 
few days before who was carrying $1300 
to the bank as a result of his seasons 
wark. 


A PERNICIOUS PRINCIPLE. 

The principle of separate schools for 
the races in the North is pernicious. 
Such a course creates race prejudice of 
the deepest dye. It imbitters one race 
against the other, and creates the idea 
in the mind of one that he is better than 
the other, and is therefore entitled to 
more advantages under the laws of the 
nation. Separate schools are the founda¬ 
tion upon which all other separations of 
the races are based. It is simply the 
beginning of the rankest sort of race 
prejudice and race hatred. It is the 
laying of the foundation of one of the 
very worst evils that any neighborhood 
in any Northern State could possibl** 


have within its bounds. Race prejudice, 
like a snake, always begins small, and 
after it gets a start it “just grows.” The 
disfranchisement of the black race in the 
Southern States was laid in the school 
room. It began with the little, innocent 
school children, years ago, nad has now 
wrapped its coils around the necks of the 
strongest men of the race in that once 
delightful part of the United States. 

After segregation, humiliation and de¬ 
gradation of the race in the school room 
came separate cars in the public carrier 
service, disfranchisement of the black 
man at the ballot box, and the taking 
away of his rights in the courts of those 
stated.—Red Bank (N. J.) Mail and Ex¬ 
press. 

Our local seaprate school agitators 
should take notice and govern themselves 
accordingly. However, if they must have 
separate schools, no one will object to 
their going down in Texas or Missis¬ 
sippi, where jim-crowism is flourishing 
in all its glory. Perhaps a short sojourn 
in South Carolina might suit them bet¬ 
ter, where the law makes the negro ride 
in the rear of the street cars with his 
back to the way the cars are going. 
The negro is a strange inconsistent ani¬ 
mal. 


There is no gainsaying that the “all- 
around” climate of Los Angeles is the 
chief asset. Years ago Helen Hunt 
Jackson, Charles A. Dana, Charles Nord- 
hoff and Charles Dudley Warner gave 
its climatology extended consideration. 
They penned a profusion of wonderful 
word pictures about the enticement of the 
balmy air. the cloudless heavens, the 
green fields and flowering hedgerows of 
resplendent bloom in this land of sun¬ 
shine. This fascinating allurement, com¬ 
pelling as ever, is calling thousands. The 
number of commodious dwellings and 
artistic cottage homes increase monthly 
and the general spaciousness of the 
building sites impress the visitor. Drop 
a New Yorker down among the beauti¬ 
ful homes clustering around Chester 
Place, the West Adams or Westlake dis¬ 
tricts, and he would marvel at the pro¬ 
digality in private landscape gardening.

HOTEL CANADIAN. 

J. W. Gordon, proprietor, fills a long- 
felt want. It is a modern up-to-date 
hotel containing 30 rooms and has a 
handsome parlor and reading room and 
grill. In the reading room are to be 
found all of the leading daily and week¬ 
ly papers. These with stationery are 
all free to guests. So well has the Ca¬ 
nadian been appreciated by the colored 
people for whose accommodation it was 
erected, that it has already proven too 
small to accommodate its patrons; 20 

more rooms will be added as soon as the 
work can be done. The Canadian em¬ 
ploys ten colored persons. Mr. Gordon 
richly deserves the success he is meet¬ 
ing with. The Canadian is situated on 
the corner of Stevenson avenue and 
Hewitt street; the principal street car 
lines pass the door.

BISHOP TURNER NOT PLEASED. 

At the A. M. E. Conference, held at 
Macon. Ga., November 24th, Bishop 
Henry M. Turner, senior Bishop of the 
A. M. E. Church, made a bitter attack 
upon the Supreme. Court of the United 
States. Some race papers have criticised 
the good Bishop for his utterances, but 
after reading what is reported as being 
his- words, we agree in part with him. 
The -Bishop said: 

“I am not pleased with this nation. 
No man hates this nation more than 
I do. When I go to say my prayers 
I have a struggle to get to the place 
where I am willing for God to allow 
the United States Supreme Court to 
have part in my prayer. That damn¬ 
able institution, which raped the negro 
of every vestige of human or manhood’s 


right—the men that compose that body 
may get to heaven the best way they 
can, but very little help God will grant 
them from any request that I make. 

“The Negro will never be anything 
in this country but a scullion until he 
shows 1 his manhood. Go to Africa and 
build up a great nation that will com¬ 
mand the respect of the civilized world. 

"We could organize and agitate and 
pay men to stay at Wahsington and 
plead for the cutting down of the South¬ 
ern representation, while the South is 
pleading for our disfranchisement, and 
much good could be accomplished. But 
the Negro is a miserable coward. He 
just stays here and preaches, ‘Heaven up 
yonder’ and ‘Hell down yonder/ and 
says, Wait on the Lord/ Why wait on 
the Lord to do for you what you can 
do for yourself?” 

What the Bishop had to say about the 
United States Supreme Court is true in 
every narticular. There is not a more 
anti-Negro body on earth than the said 
court. The United States Supreme Court 
has sided with the mob or constitution 
nullifiers in every case involving the 
Negro's constitutional rights. We have 
heard Negroes pray for many men and 
things that needed damning more than 
they did prayers, but we never heard of 
a negro praying for the United States 
Supreme Court, the concensus of opinion 
being that the majority of that august 
body have reached that point in life 
where prayers availeth nothing. 

The war records show that Bishop 
ITirner is not the first man in t.iat sec¬ 
tion who hated this country. We did 
not agree with the men who hated this 
country so bad that they fought four 
years in an attempt to destroy it. We 
did not agree with them then, and we 
do not agree with Bishop Turner now. 
although we admire him for havin° the 
courage of his convictions. This is a 
white man’s country only in the sense 
that his superior numbers enable him 
to dominate in its administration. The 
negro is a citizen, and by an independent 
manly use of his ballot can force tlios-c 
charged with the execution of the laws 
to respect his rights. The Bishop says: 
“The Negro is a miserable cowara/' This 
is nil loo true with respect to the de¬ 
fense of his rights. Fie is waiting on the 
Lord or some white man to do what he 
alone r*hotild do, and which will never be 
done until he docs it himself. !There is 
no need of the Negro going to Africa. 
This is his home. Emigration is not a 
remedy in the present crisis.

THE GARRISON CENTENNIAL. 

The one hundredth anniversary of the 
birth of Wm. Lloyd Garrison was fit¬ 
tingly observed by a large audience 
which met in the auditorium of the Wes¬ 
ley Chapel M. E. Church on the ioth 
inst. The large auditorium was filled 
with representatives of every colored 
church in the city, the overflow filling 
much of the space in the gallery. The 
meeting was in charge of Major Allens- 
worth, late chaplain of the United States 
army. One pleasing feature of the meet¬ 
ing was that it opened on time, with 
the seats all filled, thus preventing the 
interruption of the program by-late com¬ 
ers. Major Allensworth is a forceful, 
logical and enthusiastic speaker, and 
soon imparted his enthusiasm to his aud¬ 
ience. He read one of Garrison’s anti¬ 
slavery speeches with such eloquence 
and zeal as to call forth repeated ap¬ 
plause from the audience. Papers on 
Garrison’s life were read by Capt. Crum¬ 
bly and the editor if this journal, after 
which the chairman turned the meeting 
over to the audience, requesting each to 
give a quotation from Garrison’s writ¬ 
ings. It was a revelation to see how 
widely the productions of his pen had 
been read by the men and women he 
sacrificed so much to free. The meet¬ 
ing opened and closed by singing “The 
Battle Hvmn of the Republic.” It was 


sung with a spirit that is known only to 
colored audiences. The celebration was 
a success in many ways-, and was very 
educating to all present. 


TPTE MALLORY CASE. 

The ease with which the El Paso, 
Texas, authorities identified Mallory, 
suspected of killing a policeman there 
six years ago, shows the danger of tak¬ 
ing the word of persons in that mob- 
ridden section when a Negro is the sub¬ 
ject. The Governor who respects hu¬ 
man life or liberty should be slow to 
extradite Negroes wanted in the South 
on a criminal charge. The Governors of 
Ohio and Kansas each refused to grant 
the extradition of Negroes wanted in 
Southern states. Their refusal was based 
solely on the ground that the Negro 
would be subject to mob violence, or 
denied a fair trial, if returned. Ex- 
Governor Taylor of Kentucky, who is 
charged with complicity in the murder 
of the late Governor Goebel of that 
state, is protected by the Governor of 
Indiana from extradition, not for fear 
of lynching, but on the ground that he 
could not get a fair trial. We under¬ 
stand that even Governor Vardaman re¬ 
cently refused to extradite a Texas Ne¬ 
gro, giving as his reason his desire not 
to be a party to a lynching. In the Mal¬ 
lory case Governor Pardee acted a noble 
part. He gave the man a chance. That 
was all he asked. 


THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. 

The President’s message is a long, 
well-worded document, and is well 
worth careful reading. It is disappoint¬ 
ing in some particulars, especially in its 
seeming bid for a compromise on some 
measures of reform that he has so’stren¬ 
uously advocated. While devoting con¬ 
siderable space to corrup election meth¬ 
ods in the North, he had nothing to say 
of nullification in the South. His fail¬ 
ure to take a firm stand against southern 
disfranchisement is to our mind a sad 
yielding to the lawless element of the 
country. The President has lost the 
opportunity of his life. 


THERE ARE ONLY EIGPIT IN THE 
UNITED STATES WHO ARE 
REALLY WORTH WHILE, AND 
MR. ROOSEVELT IS TPIIRD 
AMONG THESE. 

“There are eight men really worth 
while in this country, and first of all I 
place Booker T. Washington,” said Dr. 
Albert E. Winship, editor of the New 
England Journal of Education of Bos¬ 
ton, in an address before the Los An¬ 
geles City Teachers’ institute, in the 
polytechnic high school, this morning. 

,,Second, I place Jacob Riis, third I 
believe I must put Theodore Roosevelt, 
fourth I place Judge Ben Lindsey of 
.Denver, because of his great work in 
reforming the youths of the country. 

“Power and poise arc the standards 
which will rule education in the future. 
Organization will be wiped out and one 
day will be only a tradition. Power is 
the new watchword, and it will be the 
effort of education of the future to de¬ 
velop it. 

“But power must have a poise. That 
is what is the watter with organization 
today. It has the power but not the 
poise, and as a consequence Chicago, 
which always has been democratic, went 
republican. Ohio, which always has been 
republican, went democratic; Philadel¬ 
phia went prohibitory when it had not 
known such a thing existed; New York 
was Jeromized, while all parties fought 
each other for the mastery. 

This school system of today will have 
to be rechristened. We must build un 
power to fight the game of life, and we 
must have the poise to use that power 
correctly. We must build up a power 
in the child to defy the ‘gang/ which 
would lead him astray; we must teach 
him poise to use that power to the best 
of his advantage. Such is the mission 
of the schools.”—Evening Express, Dec. 
iSth.

MRS. JULIA B. ROAN AT REST. 

By the death of Mrs. Julia B. Roan, 
a well-known and talented singer of this 
city, the community has lost a valuab e 
member whose services will be greatlv 
missed, and whose place will be hard 
to fill. As a singer, Mrs. Roan pos¬ 
sessed rare talents, and would easily 
have attained a national reputation had 
her environments been such as can be 
found in any eastern city of this size. 

She was a public-spirited woman and 
devoted her splendid talents to every 
good cause that needed assistance, and 
her untimely death comes as a severe 
blow to the whole community. A noble 
woman too early has fallen asleep. 


The Mob Disappointed. 
The Negro it Prepared 
to Lynch Didn’t Come. 

MALLORY GOES FREE. 

After spending two weeks in jail, Mr. 
Levy Mallory, who was arrested by Of¬ 
ficers Randolph and Glen on suspicion 
of having killed a white policeman in 
Texas six years ago, was discharged, 
having proven his alibi. That Mallory 
got an ppoortunity to prove an alibi was 
due to the untiring efforts of Messrs. 
James Alexander, Capt. F. H. Crumbly, 
Major Allensworth, Editor T. A. Greene. 
Eugene Walker, R. C. Owens, Rhone, 
Rev. G. R- Bryant and others. On 
Monday following the arival of the Tex¬ 
as Sheriff, Messrs. Alexander, T. A. 
Greene, Capt. Crumbly and the editor 
of this journal went to the city jail 
and, throusrh the courtesy of Chief of 
Police Auble, had an interview with 
Mallory, which convinced each that he 
was innocent, and they resolved that 
nothing should be left undone to secure 
his discharge. Governor Pardee was 
requested by telegraph to withhold his 
signature from the extradition papers 
pending an investigation of Mallory’s 
past record. Mallory is an ex-Union 
soldier, having served in the Ninth Cav¬ 
alry, and was stationed at Fort Wingate, 
N. M., at the time of the killing. The 
wires between this city and the War 
Department at Washington were kept 
hot until Mallory’s innocence was estab¬ 
lished. Surgeon Major Nichols and his 
good wife also came nobly to his res¬ 
cue. Major Nichols was surgeon of 
Mallory’s regiment at Fort Wingate and 
came voluntarily to his aid, Mallory be¬ 
ing unaware of the presence of the doc¬ 
tor and his wife iti this city. But for 
the aid of the persons mentioned, Mal¬ 
lory, though innocent, would have been 
lynched or burned at the stake long ago. 
The mob to put him to death was al¬ 
ready formed and was looking forward 
to the event with the same ccstacy that 
children do to the arrival of Santa Claus. 

Officers Randolph and Glen have been 
severely criticised for making the arrest 
on suspicion, knowing, as they did, that 
Mallory would be identified by the au¬ 
thorities in Texas, whether he had ever 
been in that state or not. Had the pic¬ 


ture of either officer making the ar¬ 
rest been sent to Texas it would have 
been promptly identified as the Negro 
wanted, and a mob formed to execute 
him. When the Governor of anv South¬ 
ern state issues a requisition on the Gov¬ 
ernor of a Northern or Western state 
for a Negro, it means a lynching, wheth¬ 
er guilty or innocent, if the Negro is 
returned, and no one knows this better 
than do the officers named. Had Mal¬ 
lory been wanted in any state north of 
the Mason and Dixon line, where the 
people generally respect the law, the case 
would have been different. As there is 
no law for the protection of Negroes in 
the South ( to evade the arrest of a 
Negro wanted there not only violates 
no law. but saves the country the dis¬ 
grace of a lynching. If the majority of 
the Southern people knew that lynching 
is heathenish and disgraceful, they 
would put a stop to it. Messrs. Ran¬ 
dolph and Glen are both good officers 
and did their duty as they understood 
it, but in its performance came danger¬ 
ously near s-ending to the stake an in¬ 
nocent member of their race. While 
our entire race stands ever ready to aid 
the officers of the law in apprehending 
criminals, they draw the line on mobs. 
The man who aids the law in suppress¬ 
ing crime renders to his community 
and to himself his best services, but to 
any way aid a mob assassinates the law. 
If Mallory had been returned to Texas 
he would have been lynched, and Officers 
Randolph and Glen would have been 
kept busy catching innocent Negroes to 
be identified and lynched by Southern 
mobs.
