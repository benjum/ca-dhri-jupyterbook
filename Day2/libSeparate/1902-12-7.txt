he declared that the American people 
had forgotten their duties in a mad 
rush for wealth and fame. 

“It is every man for himself,” he de¬ 
clared. “The typical American is heed¬ 
less of how he achieves his end. Those 
that come in his way are trampled 
upon or pushed aside. It is this lack 
of respect for the wishes and rights of 
others that has brought about condi¬ 
tions in this country that border on 
the anarchistic.” 

Irreverence, declared Bishop White, 
was responsible for the existing evii 
conditions. He declared that, the Amer¬ 
ican education tended to create irrev¬ 
erence and that the strenuosity of 
American life had the effect of increas¬ 
ing the irreverent spirit. 

“Our institutions,” said the bishop, 
“have had such a rapid growth and our 
progress has been so wonderfu lthat we 
are filled with an admiration for our¬ 
selves that surpasses our admiration 
for anything else.” 

The picture nere presented by the 
honest bishop is a gloomy one, but it 
is by no means overdrawn. The crim¬ 
inal record that the American people 
are making is outstripping all other 
records. Although crime everywhere 
is on the increase, the church is putting 
forth no effort to check them. The 
strong burn the weak at the stake as 
a pastime. Murder, robbery, adultery, 
prostitution are committed in high 
places, mobs ioam at will, murdering 
defenseless citizens without let or hin¬ 
drance. All the church anff state want 
is money. With money anything can 
be bought. Whither are we drifting?

SHOULD PUT ASIDE PARTISAN- 
• SHIP. 

In this, as in all municipal cam¬ 
paigns, partisanship should be put 
aside, so far as possible. In the choos¬ 
ing of officials to have charge of the 
municipal government for the next two 
years, we shall be voting for our 
friends and neighbors, not as Repub¬ 
licans and Democrats, but as citizens of 
a common municipality, in the welfare 
of which all of us are, or should be, 
equally interested. It is therefore in¬ 
cumbent upon every good citizen to put 
aside partisanship, and do the utmost 
that is in his power to aid in and se¬ 
cure the election to office of the very 
best candidates wnose names appear 
upon the tickets to be voted. The 
Times will not at this time go into a 
detailed discussion of the merits of the 
respective candidates. All this will 
copne later, and in due time. The pres¬ 
ent purpose is merely to remind its 
readers of the fact that the municipal 
campaign is close at hand, and that the 
issues of the general campaign, just 
closed, were no less important.— 
Times. 

Those fool negroes who never voted 
anything but the straight Republican 
ticket should read and learn. 


UNCLE BILLY. 


Mr. W. H. Workman, popularly 
known as “Uncle Billy,” present 
city treasurer and candidate for 
re-election, needs no introduction. He 
has been a resident of the city almost 
half a century, and has been identified 
with every movement for the city’s ad¬ 
vancement, and has spent large sums 
of paoney for improvements. In the sale 


of the $2,000,000 water bonds he ren¬ 
dered the city valuable service. His 
administration of the treasury depart¬ 
ment has been done on such business¬ 
like principles that his re-election 
seems almost certain. That voters will 
vote for him regardless of party goes 
without saying. He has made an able, 
kind, efficient officer and deserves a re- 
election. 


FOR BOARD OF EDUCATION.—Mr. 
Catesby C. Thom, candidate for the 
Board of Education, is a young man 
fully capable for the position and ought 
to win. He is the son of ex-Mayor 
Thom and has resided in the Seventh 
ward twenty-six years. He was edu¬ 
cated in the city schools, served Uncle 
Sam one year in the Philippines during 
the Spanish-American war. He was ad¬ 
mitted to practice law in the state and 
federal courts in 1900.

Samuel M. Haskins, Democratic can¬ 
didate for City Clerk, is 30 years old, 
having been born in Salt Lake City in 
1872, and is a son of the late Rev. T. 
W. Haskins, D.D., founder of Christ 
Episcopal church of this city. During 
his early life Mr, Haskins lived in the 
New England states and came to Los 
Angeles from Vermont in 1887. He 
graduated from the Los Angeles High 
school in 1889, and then went to the 
University of California at Berkeley, 
where he graduated in 1893. 

Returning to Los Angeles Mr. Has¬ 
kins studied law for a year, and was 
admitted to practice immediately prior 
to assuming the position of chief deputy 
under City Clerk Hance six years ago. 
1 his deputyship he has held contin¬ 
uously. 

On city business generally, Mr. Has¬ 
kins is justly regarded as an authority, 
and there is nothing about the clerk’s 
office that he does not have at his fin¬ 
ger ends. He has a happy faculty of 
making friends, and has a larger per¬ 
sonal following than perhaps any other 
young man in Los Angeles, upon which 
he largely counts for success in the 
coming election. There never has been 
any criticism in the conduct of the city 
clerk’s office during the time Mr. Has¬ 
kins has been virtually in control under 
Captain Hance, and he says he will 
maintain the record if he is chosen to 
be its chief.

LEE A. M’CONNELL, FOR CITY AS¬ 
SESSOR. 

Lee A. McConnell, Democratic can¬ 
didate for City Assessor, was born in 
Missouri forty-three years ago. Early 
in life he was thrown on his own re¬ 
sources, by the death of his father, and 
at the age of 9 years, with a widowed 
mother to help support, he entered the 
drug business as an apprentice. He 
worked his way up in this profession, 
until he had accumulated means suffi¬ 
cient to take a course in the leading 
Baltimore College of Pharmacy. 

Later, Mr. McConnell became the 
manager of a large wholesale drug 
store in Pueblo, Colo. 

Mr. McConnell is a charter member 
of the Chamber of Commerce, as well 
as the Los Angeles Stock and Bond ex¬ 
change and Los Angeles Stock Ex¬ 
change. Aside from the business en¬ 
terprises in which he is interested, Mr. 
McConnell has for many years been a 
subscriber to the Y. M. C. A., the Pa¬ 
cific Gospel Union and other organiza¬ 
tions for the moral uplift of the com¬ 
munity. He and his wife are both 
church members.

EDWARD KERN, FOR COUNCILMAN 
SEVENTH WARD. 


Edward Kern, Democratic nominee 
for councilman in the Seventh ward, 
was born on a farm in Warren county, 
Iowa, in 1860. 

During the War of the Rebellion his 
father raised a company and was mus¬ 
tered into the service as captain of 
Company H of the Thirty-fourth Iowa 
Volunteers. He served during the war, 
participating in the siege of Vicksburg, 
and Banks’ Red River expedition, and 
was promoted to the rank of major. 

Mr. Kern secured his education in the 
public schools, going to school in the 
winter and working on the farm in the 
summer. He came to California first 
about sixteen years ago and has most 
of the time since resided in Los An¬ 
geles county. 

He has a ranch in the northern part 
of the county, near Fairmount. For 
the past few years Mr. Kern has been 
residing in the Seventh ward, and en¬ 
gaged in the ice business, first as a 
driver and then as a route foreman of 
the Los Angeles Ice & Cold Storage Co. 
He is now superintendent of deliveries 
for the three companies and handles 
the delivery for the entire city. 

Mr. Kern is a married man. He be¬ 
longs to several societies, among them 
being the I. O. O. F. f A. 0. U. W., Mod¬ 
ern Woodmen of America, Independent 
Order of Foresters, also the Royal For¬ 
esters.

The democratic city convention 
warmed up to its labors last night and 
had time to spare before the lights 
were turned out. 

When the nominations for tax col¬ 
lector were called, late in the after¬ 
noon. the names of James Kenealy, 
W. H. Younger and Jasper O. Simons 
were presented to the convention. 
Younger’s friends withdrew his name 
when the Sixth ward cast an almost 
solid vote for Kenealy, and Simons 
pulled out of the race when the Sev¬ 
enth’s ninety-three votes were cast for 
“Uncle 0 John. He was declared the 
unanimous choice of the convention. 
His friends say he will make a strong 
run and will be a strong team mate 
for “Uncle Billy” Workman. 


TAKE YOUR CHOICE.—The colored 
voters will soon choose between Mayor 
Snyder and Hon. P. W. Powers, candi¬ 
dates for mayor. Both of them are 
gentlemen, or they would not have been 
nominated. It is a local contest—a 
matter of business. Mayor Snyder has 
been tried and not found wanting. He 
is known to be a true and tried friend 
of the negroes—that's why this journal 
is supporting him. As between two 
white gentlemen we stand by the one 
that is most friendly to the negro. The 
success or defeat of the Republican or 
Democratic parties locally is a 
small .matter with us, as the ad¬ 
ministration will still be in the 
hands of the white people, and 
they are all one after the election. The 
election of men that will give the ne¬ 
gro the greatest opportunity to earn a 
living and develop his talents is what 
concerns us most in this or any political 
contest. The white men will be safe 
in any event. We are defeated only 
when the friends of the negro are de¬ 
feated, whether Democrats or Repub¬ 
licans. This is stating it as plain as 
we can. The editor of this journal is 
a plow man, not an office seeker, and 
sells his produce to both Democrats and 
Republicans. Being independent, we 
are in a position to say what we hon¬ 
estly believe, to work for the election 
of men whom we know or believe to 
be friends of the race. We judge men 
by their past records, and if we find 
them not faithful when in charge of a 
few things, we are not willing to in¬ 
trust them with many things. Colored 
reader, you are at liberty to vote ab. 
you please. The records of the two 
candidates are before you. You have 
more to gain or lose by your vote than 
we have. We have a lifetime job and 
the only competition noted is among 
the inexperienced, who are trying to 
leave the plow. You have Snyder the 
doer, and Powers the promiser, take 
your choice. 

-o- 

Ex-Rev. Kelley.—Things look a lit¬ 
tle gloomy for Rev. Kelley, the despoil¬ 
er of fe,male virtue. The race papers 
in San Francisco are rubbing it into 
him hard. 

Mr. Pearson, the distinguished Oak¬ 
land attorney, gave him an unmerciful 
scourging. Lay it on him, boys! He 
need it and needs it bad. It is ru¬ 
mored that some misguided woman in 
this city is putting up money for 
him. This is hard to believe. There 
are colored men calling themselves re¬ 
spectable who are acting as “go be- 
tweens” for a few dollars, purchased 
at the price of female virtue. These 
fellows are trying to run cheap bluffs. 
They have mothers, sisters and wives 
and children, or ought to have. Shame! 
shame! The pulpit must be cleared of 
these moral lepers. 


We are for the Democratic municipal 
ticket because the Democrats in this 
city have given the colored voters 
more responsible and better paying po¬ 
sitions than the Republicans have 
given them. If the man Mr. Powers 
placed on the board of police commis¬ 
sioners had been a friend to negroes, 
Beaty, Glenn and Russell would now 
be on the regular police force. Mr. 
Powers made no colored appointments, 
so his man on the police commission 
adopted the policy of his boss. The 
Democratic ticket is the equal of the 
Republican ticket with the exception 
of the head. In this case the Demo¬ 
cratic ticket is headed by a people’s 
man, while the Republican ticket is 
headed by the railroad’s man. Look 
out for friends first, then party. 

-o—- 

HAS JOINED THE SIX BITS PUSH. 

Prof. Easton is the “me too” of the 
old discarded “six bits push.” Rev. C. 
H. Anderson is chaplain. While there 
is considerable surprise expressed at 
the actions of Prof. Easton in falling in 
evil paths so early, the actions of Rev. 
Anderson occasion no surprise, as he 
always leaves his pulpit when there s 
a chance to “do politics.” This, of 
course, is by J ho means a crime, but 
the minister who leaves his exalted po¬ 
sition to do politics cannot command 
the respect that his great calling de¬ 
mands. As there are no moral ques¬ 
tions at issue in this campaign, the 
white ministers have kept their gar¬ 
ments clean. There is hope for Broth¬ 
er Anderson, for Jesus weeps, he weeps 
and loves him still. 

-o- 

A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. 

The opportunity for the colored peo¬ 
ple to acquire homes in Southern Cal¬ 
ifornia was never greater than now. 
There are thousands of acres of val¬ 
uable agricultural lands that can be 
purchased by colonies at from $10 to 
$25 per acre. It sells now in small lots 
at $25 to $50 per acre. A gentleman the 
other day placed at our disposal 40,000 
acres of good land, suitable for decid¬ 
uous fruits and all kinds of vegetables. 
As this land is right on the railroad a 
ready market is brought to the door of 
the farmer. The demand for farm pro¬ 
duce is always greater than the supply, 
so prices are always good. A colony of 
300* families with $200 per family can 
get this land and build a town with 
schools and churches, thus giving them 
an opportunity to show what they can 
do. In the surrounding towns the sons 
and daughters of the colonists can get 
ready employment at $15 to $25 per 
month. This would board the families 
while making their first crop. These 
opportunities cannot last.

B 



JOHN KENEALY, FO CITY TAX AND 
LICENSE COLLECTOR. 


Personally, there is not a more popu¬ 
lar man in Los Angeles than Mr. Ken- 
ealy, and it was upon this personal 
prestige the Democrats based their 
hopes of success in nominating him for 
the office. Mr. Kenealy says frankly 
the reason he is seeking the office is 
because he needs it. Ten years ago he 
never believed he would take any office 
within the gift of the people, but cir¬ 
cumstances have changed, and he says 
he will be thankful if he is elected. 

Apart from a lifetime spent in build¬ 
ing up the city, Mr. Kenealy’s great ex¬ 
perience in business in Los Angeles, 
his capacity for hard work, his famil¬ 
iarity with the needs of the city, and 
his wide list of friends and acquaint¬ 
ances, all make him an especially 
strong candidate. 

-o- 

BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL 
KNOW THEM—If the colored voters 
should measure the two leading candi¬ 
dates for mayor, Hon. M. P. Snyder and 
Mr. P. W. Powers, by the above stand¬ 
ard, the whole colored vote would be 
polled for Mr. Snyder. Mr. Powers is 
just now unusually concerned about the 
negro and his welfare. In the distribu¬ 
tion of public patronage he thinks his 
party has treated the colored voters 
badly. He is just aching to be elected 
mayor so that with the balm of official 
patronage he can anoint the wounds of 
che much-abused colored voters. Now 
if Mr. Powers had taken advantage of 
the opportunities that have been wal¬ 
lowing at his feet to help the negroes 
we would sympathize with him in his 
present solicitude. 


NO FRUIT.—For the past two years 
Mr. Powers has held the position of 
president of the city council. As such 
his share of the public patronage 
amounted to about forty positions. How 
many of these appointments has he 
given the negroes? He has appointees 
in the engineer’s, fire, street, police and 
water departments. Among them there 
is not a single negro, as far as we can 
learn. Why didn’t Mr. Powers remepa- 
ber the colored man and brother while 
making those appointments ? Why 
didn’t he practice then, what he is 
preaching now? He even saved up a 
good job in the street department for 
his son. So far as the negro is con¬ 
cerned the Powers tree is barren; the 
colored voters should do what they 
can to grub it up. 

Mayor Snyder has only to point to 
his record in the past as an index to 
his future dealings with his colored fel¬ 
low citizens. His record has been man¬ 
ly, fair and just. He has never lost an 
opportunity to assist the negro by giv¬ 
ing him a working chance. For the 
colored voters to desert him for Mr. 
Powers is swapping bread for stones. 
Randolph in the police, Bright and 
Glenn In the fire departments and 
Messenger Johnson in the city hall are 
fruits borne on the Snyder tree. “By 
their fruits ye shall know them.’’ To 
desert a friend because his enemy says 
he is to be beaten, is the rankest cow¬ 
ardice. To stand or fall with your 
friends is a virtue that never goes un¬ 
rewarded. Mr. Powers’ friends are 
promising the colored voters every¬ 
thing but the sidewalks, just as Eaton’s 
friends did four years ago, and they 
will be fulfilled just as Eaton did. Sev¬ 
eral negroes have already got happy 
and quit work to electioneer for Mr. 
Powers on mere promises. Will tbe 
negro never cease to be a fool? One 
excellent shoe polishing artist is labor¬ 
ing under the delusion that, with a 
gold pen up over his ear, he is to stand 
behind a big stack of books as clerk in 
the city hall as soon as Mr. Powers is 
elected. Now if Mr. Powers had any 
record for the appointment of colored 
men, this .might be all right, but he has 
none. “By their fruits ye shall know 
them.” Remove from office the negroes 
that Mayor Snyder has appointed and 
the negro has nothing left. Take your 
choice. 

-o- 

Elsewhere in this edition will be 
found cuts and short writeups of sev¬ 
eral gentlemen who desire the suffrage 
of the voters on December 1. These 
gentlemen are well fitted for the po¬ 
sitions for which they aspire. We hope 
the colored voters will carefully con¬ 
sider the claims of these gentlemen be¬ 
fore voting. By placing their cards in 
this paper they have used the same 
means to get colored votes as they have 
to get white ones. This fact should not 
be lost sight of. A vote for them is a 
vote for racial advancement. 


MAYOR SNYDER. 

If the best interest of the city is to he 
served, if the best interest -of the citi¬ 
zens and taxpayers is to be protected, 
by all means Mayor Snyder should be 
re-elected. During his administration 
some of the knottiest problems in the 
history of the city have been set¬ 
tled and settled in the interest of the 
people. When that infamous freight¬ 
carrying franchise passed the council 
with and by the aid of Mr. Powers, his 
opponent, Mayor Snyder, vetoed it and 
saved to the city thirteen miles of beau¬ 
tiful streets. It was Mayor Snyder and 
not Mr. Powers that saved the taxpay¬ 
ers $275,000 in the water works deal. 
He has been tried, but never found 
wanting. He has been faithful to every 
trust. His life is an open book, every 
page a record of duties well done. The 
voters of this city want a man, not a 
part'san, for mayor. In IMayor Snyder 
they have always found what they 
wanted. He is one of the people for 
the people. In pointing to his record, 
we have no apology to make. 


VERY GRATIFYING. 

The progress made by the colored 
people in the acquisition of homes and 
other property has been extremely 
gratifying. Many enterprises have 
been undertaken by the race and all 
of them are prosperous. There is a 
marked tendency on the part of the 
race to patronize each other, and the 
feeling that a closer union is needed 
is everywhere manifested. The dispo¬ 
sition to save money and do business 
was never so strong as now. The young 
men and women are learning trades and 
are preparing to employ themselves. 
The number of young ladies in the 
high school is larger than usual. We 
have several grocery stores, all doing 
well. We have one gents’ furnishing 
establishment, one tailor shop, one den¬ 
tist and three physicians, all of whom 
we are justly proud of. Let us hope 
and pray for more work and a closer 
union next year. For the colored per¬ 
son who wants to do something and be 
something, California is a paradise. 
-o-- 

DEFEATED CAPT. BEATY,—It 
must not be forgotten that the defeat 
of Capt. Beaty for appointment as po¬ 
liceman was brought about by the vote 
of Police Commissioner Walker, Re¬ 
publican from the Fourth ward. Walk¬ 
er lives in Mr. Powers' ward and was 
appointed by Mr. Powers. His action 
in voting against Capt. Beaty was in 
keeping with those of Mr- Powers, who 
has never appointed a black Repub¬ 
lican to a position, in voting against 
Capt. Beaty Mr. Walker possibly carried 
out the wishes of Mr. Powers. Mr. 
Snyder had slated three colored men 
for appointment on the police force, but 
when Beaty was defeated by a Repub¬ 
lican vote the other two were not nom¬ 
inated. “By their fruits ye shall know 
them.”

THE LIBERATOR. 


REV. DONOHOO GIVES IT UP — 
Rev. Donohoo sees the handwriting on 
the wall and is getting ready to yield 
to the inevitable. The .mistake of his 
life was made when he failed to re¬ 
sign. He has, however, made several 
mistakes, all of which are sincerely re¬ 
gretted. His police protection was a 
serious blunder; it gave his case away 
and strengthened his opponents. His 
abuse of Mrs. McDonald, a widowed 
member of his church, was very un¬ 
manly. Some things he said to her 
cannot be printed in this paper. It 
was a grievous mistake. The fight on 
him is simply the church against the 
pastor—there can be but one result— 
the pastor will have to go. The sooner 
he goes the better for him. 


WILL TAKE THE TABERNACLE 
BAPT 7 ST CHURCH. 

There is a current rumor that the 
Rev. S.W. Hawkins,whom Bishop Clin¬ 
ton sent to Oakland, is to return soon 
and take charge oft he Tabernacle Bap¬ 
tist church. In the event he runs against 
kickers who object to having a Meth¬ 
odist minister, Hawkins will pull off 
his coat and orgnpi^e an independent 
church to be known as “The Church of 
Jesus Christ.” Those who know Rev. 
Hawkins know just the kind of hang¬ 
out his so-called church would be. It 
would be the rendezvous of disreput¬ 
able secret societies that rob widows 
and speculate in the dead bodies of 
their members, the rallying ground of 
political deadbeats and six bits grafters. 


When he starts this church The Lib¬ 
erator wi'll entertain him royally. He 
is another preacher that killed himself 
“doing politics.”
