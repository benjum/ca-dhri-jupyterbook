THE LIBERATOR. 


Dr. Gen. D. Taylor, Presi¬ 
dent of the Business 
Men’s Association, Re¬ 
turns from Richmond. 
What He Saw There. 

Dr. Taylor, presideni of the Los An¬ 
geles Business Men’s Association, has 
just returned from an extended trip 
through the south. He attended the 
National Colored Business Men’s 
League, held at Richmond, Va. He 
went as a representative of the associa¬ 
tion, thus putting the colored business 
vnen of the coast in touch with those 
of the east. He reports an interesting 
session and says the colored men of the 
south and east are making marvelous 
strides in the commercial world. He 
says that in Richmond alone the col¬ 
ored people own three banks, two iarge 
wholesale and retail stores, besides 
many corner groceries, employing 
scores of young men and women, all 
colored; one shoe store, one up-to-date 
hotel containing 75 rooms, one drug 
store, one steam laundry, the machin¬ 
ery of which cost $20,000. This laun¬ 
dry- has 30 colored employes. There 
are several colored insurance com¬ 
panies. The organization of the col¬ 
ored companies forced the white com¬ 
panies to reduce the premiums required 
of their colored beneficiaries, it being 
much higher than that required of 
white patrons. The white companies 
found it necessary to employ colored 
solicitors. 

At Hampton, Va., 5000 colored people 
there have two banks and several 
stores and are doing well. The neat 
homes and farms owned by the colored 
people run up into the thousands and 
represent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. 

After a pleasant stay of several days 
with his mother and sister, whom he 
had not seen for several years, the doc¬ 
tor left Richmond for Atlanta, Ga., 
where he found the colored people ac¬ 
tively engaged in every avenue of busi¬ 
ness. Atlanta is the Athens of the 
south as regards institutions of higher 
education for colored youths, there be¬ 
ing six colored colleges in that city, 
all of which are well attended. 

Little Rock, Arkansas, was also vis 
ited. The colored men are well rep¬ 
resented in business circles of that city. 


There seems to have been an attraction 
at the last named city that affected the 
doctor as the north pole does the needle 
of the mariner’s compass. Although he 
went at it in a roundabout way, Little 
Rock was the Mecca of his journey. 
There are many refined, handsome wo¬ 
men in that southwestern city, among 
whom are several widows of entrancing 
beauty. One of these he knew when she 
was a sweet girl graduate and though 
he seemed to have kept the secret to 
himself he entertained a feeling of 
kindness toward her much stronger 
than the ordinary ties of friendship. 
Judging from his looks, he must have 
fared better than did Ichabad Crane. 

Washington, Baltimore and New 
York City were included in his tour. 

The doctor’s report is encouraging— 
highly so. He says the school facilities 
for the education of colored children in 
the cities visited by him are ample and 
are largely attended. He says the 
moral, intellectual and financial inter¬ 
ests of the race are being rapidly ad¬ 
vanced. That everywhere the march is 
onward. Let us keep our forward gait 
and “Learn to labor and to wait."

ENTERPRISING COLORED CITIZEN 


Mr. A. R. Wyne, one of the trusted 
employes of Dean’s popular drug store, 
is investing his earnings in valuable 
real estate. He is building houses to 
rent and his income from this source 
will soon be considerable. So well has 
he performed his duties, that the firm 
now employs three colored persons. 
This firm has a large colored patronage 
and it is appreciated. 

* * * 

Flint and Daniel, the grocers, are 
doing a fine business. Mr. Flint, the 
manager, is a good business man, and 
his success is only a matter of time. 
They carry a complete, well selected 
stock. Among the intelligent, thought¬ 
ful colored citizens they have a large 
trade—a good indication. 

* * * 

W. H. Smith, dealer in gents’ furn¬ 
ishing goods., carries a good stock and 
has a growing business. Mr. Sjnith 
deserves encouragement. He has am¬ 
bition of the right sort. 

* * * 

Miss Lula J. Holden, who recently 
graduated from the Los Angeles Art 


school, is an artist who will make her 
mark. Among the paintings in the 
school hers took a high rank. 

* * * 

Mr. Allen Watson has stopped his 
widowed mother from paying rent. He 
purchased her a lot on which he erect¬ 
ed a splendid roomy tent. He will 
build her a neat, comfortable cottag 
as soon as he saves money enough to 
pay cash for it. He doesn’t believe in 
going in debt. Mr. Watson never vis¬ 
its the so-called clubs or crap dives. 
He has set an example that many of 
the older men could copy with profit. 
Men who love their mothers always 
make good husbands and citizens. 

* * * 

Mr. H. Stricklin, the butcher, is en¬ 
joying prosperity so ;nuch so that he 
has found it necessary to employ an¬ 
other man. He employs one of Rev. 
C. H. Anderson’s sons. Every negro 
who succeeds lifts up his race by fur¬ 
nishing employment to some member 
of it. 

* * * 

Mr. C. W. Holden bas put in a large 
lot of machinery on his hog ranch, be¬ 
sides other improvements and will go 
into hog raising on a larger scale. 

* * * 

Mr. Van C. Williams, who holds a 
responsible position with Cass & Smurr 
Stove Co., displayed remarkable enter¬ 
prise by marrying one of our amiable 
young ladies. Now that is real enter¬ 
prising. Mr. Thilo Taylor should fol¬ 
low suit. 

* * * 

Every church member ought to make 
the ownership of a home one of his 
earthly ambitions. The c-urch with 
the largest tax paying membership can 
render the largest service for the moral 
upbuilding of its community. Poverty, 
vice and crime go hand in hand.

THE BORADWAY DEPARTMENT 
STORE. 

The sixth annual opening of the great 
Broadway Department Store was the 
largest thing of the kind ever witnessed 
in the city. For more than three hours 
a streajn. of well-dressed, happy hu¬ 
manity made up of all ages and sexes, 
nations and kindreds, surged in and 
out of that immense building. It 
looked as if the whole city had turned 
out. One of the attractions of the even¬ 
ing was the Ivy Leaf Quartette, colored. 
The young men acquitted themselves 
well, and the manager of the store ex¬ 
pressed himself as highly pleased with 
them. This great store never overlooks 
the colored people when they go to 
spend money.

Killed the Wrong Negro. 

TWO ENTERPRtcta.to WHITE WO¬ 
MEN DRESS AS NEGRO MEN FOR 

MURDER AND ROBBERY—BOTH 

KILLED. 

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. 7.—Rep¬ 
resentative C. L. Pool of Calhoun 
county was in the city tonight, and re¬ 
lated meager particulars of a bloody 
tragedy which occurred in the western 
part of Columbia county last night. Mr. 
Pool’s informant was unable to give 
the names of the parties, but related the 
facts about as follows: 

BASIS OF THE CRIME. 

A citizen of the county sold a tract 
of land for $300 cash Monday, and two 
of his neighbors, being aware of the 
transaction, went to his home the fol¬ 
lowing evening and proposed an op- 
possum hunt. Not suspecting any 
harm, the man who had the $300 in his 
house departed with the men. 

Soon afterwards a peddler drove up 
to the house and requested lodging for 
the night. The housewife, thinking her 
husband would soon return from his 
hunt, told the peddler to take his team 
to the house, which he did in short 
time. 

WOMEN IN BLACK FACES. 

When he reached the dwelling he 
found what appeared to be two negro 
men inside, who had just .murdered his 
hostess by severing her head from the 
body with a knife. The peddler shot 
and killed the two negroes and imme¬ 
diately aroused the neighbors. 

An examination revealed the 
astounding fact that the supposed ne¬ 
groes were in reality white women dis¬ 
guised as negro men, and were the 
wives of the two men who had pre¬ 
viously gone hunting with the woman’s 
husband. 

The latter failing to return, a search 
was instituted and his body found in 
the woods, where he nad been mur¬ 
dered. 

This is a pretty fair sample of what 
the negroes have to stand. He has to 
be blamed and criticized for all of his 
misdeeds because he cannot success¬ 
fully paint his face to play white when 
one wants to commit a crime, and then 
he has to be blamed for all the crimes 
like this where- the trashy whites black 
their faces and play negro when they 
are committing crime. This is a fre¬ 
quent occurrence. Now had these two 


women not been killed or captured this 
crime would have been charged to 
‘Two bully niggers.”—Preacher Safe¬ 
guard.

THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. 


(Hon. T. B. Reed, at Bowdoin Cen¬ 
tennial.) 

When the slaves were liberated the 
first thought of some of the best of 
them was to be learned preachers, doc¬ 
tors and lawyers. Heaven forbid that 
those who are worthy should be cut 
off from any employment; but the 
longing was not a wise one. Today the 
colored race is acquiring that knowl¬ 
edge which is the basis of their future 
hope, the knowledge of how to live an 
everyday life and cope with everyday 
duties. When these people have dem¬ 
onstrated, as they -surely will, their ca¬ 
pabilities for everyday life, they will 
grow to all -the rest. On the other band 
the scorn with which the Negro is 
treated is a blunder. It keeps him 
down and the scorner also. It is the 
same thing the white slaves met with 
in old feudal days. It took a thousand 
years for them to ’reach equality. If 
the principles of Christian religion 
could be honestly applied it would 
solve the problem somewhat sooner. If 
religion does not solve it, selfishness 
will’; for men will sooner or later un¬ 
derstand that a mass of ignorance can¬ 
not exist without lowering the stand¬ 
ard of those who think themselves the 
better classes—Congregationalist and 
Christian World. 

-——o- 

The following extract from the 
secretary’s report of a colored insur¬ 
ance company of Richmond, Va., shows 
that the negroes are beginning to do 
something else beside build churches: 

Receipts and disbursements for the 
year beginning July 1st, 1901, and end¬ 
ing July 1st, 1902. 

The reports showed 6400 policies is¬ 
sued for the year and 59,477 policies is¬ 
sued since the organization of the com¬ 
pany. 

Amount of insurance effected, $1,335- 
424.00; 10,579 sick and accident claims 
paid for the year, $28,863.64; 257 death 
claims paid for the year, $7,915.65; total 
amount paid for the year on 10,836 
claims, $36,779.29. 

That part of the secretary’s report on 
the farm and other properties’ of the 
company showed the same to be in first 
class condition. 

-o-— 

THE MOB. 


The Richmond (Va.) Times has seen 
fit to warn the South that unless the 
people of that section bestir themselves, 
the mob will hold full sway, and asks 
the question: “Then whose life will be 


safe?” adding, “Either the law or the 
mob will rule.” 

The position of the Times of Rich¬ 
mond and “The Times” of this city by 
their strong condemnation of paob rule 
is indeed commendable. When the ex¬ 
ample set by these papers is followed 
by other journals of like character, a 
stop will be put to our present national 
decay. Either the nation or the mob 
must go. The silence of the church and 
state regarding this crime against God 
and defenseless human beings, speaks 
bad for the future of this nation. 
Either every citizen of this country, re¬ 
gardless of race, color or condition, 
Will have to have the full protection of 
the laws, or the silence of national 
death will reign in the deserted halls 
of congress that pervades the capital 
of all the nations that have forgotten 
God. 

“The god that reigned over Babylon 
is the god that is reigning now.” 

CHILDLESS MARRIAGE. 

There is no condition of wedded life 
so fraught with infelicity, temptations, 
loss of health, youth and charms as 
are childless marriages. Without chil¬ 
dren the home can never be the tem¬ 
porary heaven, with the wife and moth¬ 
er as the sun of the domestic circle, 
that it was designed to be. 

In fact, in the ’ -* - sweetness 

of that term, there can be no home 
without children. But the college bred 
woman, the new woman, the ""-to-date 
woman, who wears bloomers, runs 
wheel races, plays golf, gambles and 
bets on horse races, are not expected 
to sacrifice these innocent amusements 
for the duties maternity, certainly not. 
They cast away diamonds to secure 
pebbles, sacrifice the real for the im¬ 
aginary. For selfish pleasure never re¬ 
alized, they saermee health, home, hap¬ 
piness for premature old age, infidel¬ 
ity, divorce, insanity, suicide. These 
results follow the means too often re¬ 
sorted to, to bring about childless mar¬ 
riages. The woman is always the loser 
by these infractions of nature’s laws. 
“The wages of sin is death.” 

--—o- 

If the negro hopes to enjoy the full 
benefit of American citizenship he will 
have to get in and he an American citi¬ 
zen by putting his shoulder to the 
wheel of progress along with the white 
citizens. He will have to actively sym¬ 
pathize with white people in their ef¬ 
forts to advance the moral and mate¬ 
rial welfare of the country. He will 
have to raise the moral and intellect¬ 
ual standing of his children. He will 
have to save his money and deal in 
government bonds, bank railroad and 
canal stocks. This government is not 
and never will be run by paupers. No 
government ever was. The negro must 
act in the living present or not act at 
all. God loves the white man because 
he loves himself.

HAMBURGER PUNGLED UP.—In 
the August number -of the Liberator, 
under the caption of “No. Fight on 
Hamburger,” we called the attention 
of the colored citizen to the fact that 
Hamburger did not advertise in colored 
papers or in any way patronized enter¬ 
prises owned or controlled by negroes. 
This, of course, he has a perfect right 
to do, and the negro has the right to 
do the same thing as regards Mr. Ham¬ 
burger and his enterprises. When he 
read the article his eyes bulged and the 
sweat rolled. He read the paper 
throughout and, being a good judge of 
a newspaper, he knew that none but 
an intelligent people would support a 
paper gotten up in the shape, neatness 
and completeness with which “The Lib¬ 
erator” is gotten up. He squirmed like 
a worm too near the fire. Now, Mr. 
Hamburger is a business man and 
knows that there will soon be 10,000 
colored people in this city, and that he 
could not hope to get a share of their 
trade, with an able, up-to-date paper 
like “The Liberator” calling attention 


to the fact that he ignores negro en¬ 
terprises. The other day one of the 
colored papers came to our exchange 
table with a big advertisement from 
Hamburger, the first in the history of 
his business. Like Napoleon I, Mr. 
Hamburger knows the harm that an 
adverse newspaper - can do. This is an 
object lesson from which the colored 
people can draw some valuable conclu¬ 
sions: that no man is compelled to pa¬ 
tronize their enterprises, and that they 
are not compelled to patronize his. Any 
person will patronize your enterprises 
if you make it to his interest. To pa¬ 
tronize those who patronize you is the 
key that will unlock the door to many 
avenues that are now closed to the race. 
While business may recognize a fool, 
it knows no color. 


Judge Morgan.—Police Justice Mor¬ 
gan is a candidate for re-election to his 
present position. The able and pains¬ 
taking manner in which he has per¬ 
formed the duties of the office entitles 
him to the endorsement of the voters 
by re-electiom This, we believe, he 
will get, for the voters of this city and 
county are non-partisan in the selec¬ 
tion of their judges, As a result they 
have a judiciary that is second to none. 
Judge Morgan has given the city an 
able, clean administration, and the 
peace and dignity of this community 
has been upheld as far as lay in his 
power. He has carefully guarded the 
rights of the colored citizens by giving 
them representation on the juries and 
whe nhe thought best has given them 
juries composed entirely of their own 
race. This must not be forgotten.

The chances of the election of Mr. 


-o- 


MR. EDWARD L. HUTCHISON. 

Mr. Hutchison, nominee for state 
senator for the 36th senatorial district, 
is a self-made man in its truest sense. 
Starting in the world without a dol¬ 
lar, he has unaided won a place 
in the legal profession of which 
any man of his age could feel 
proud. His ability ** been repeatedly 
recognized by the vot' v — of the city. 
He served the city as councilman from 
the 8th ward for several years, during 
which time he was ever the champion 
of the taxpayers. He is a clean, ca¬ 
pable representative of the common 
people that came up from among them. 
At this writing the indications point to 

the election of Mr. Hut_son by a safe 

majority. His opponents, who do not 
seem to be numerous, give him credit 
for being everything that we say he is. 
Their only argument against him is 
that his election -might endanger the 
re-election of U. S. Senator Perkins. 
That there is not the remotest danger 
of this is so well known by the voters 
of the district that it will not cost him 
a single vote. If the voters of that dis¬ 
trict make the highest merit the requi¬ 
site for promotion on November 7th 
their ballots will reau when deposited: 


For Senator 36th Sena¬ 
torial District, 
Edward L. Hutchison. 



“Political Short Stops,” a series of 
articles written for The Enterprise by 
Prof. W. E. Easton, form an interesting 
feature of its entertaining news col¬ 
umns. Prof. Easton is a writer of 
more than national repute. The En¬ 
terprise is indeed enterprising. Best 
wishes, neighbor. 


Le Compte Davis for senator in the 
Thirty-eighth senatorial district are 
steadily growing brighter. He is mak¬ 
ing a thorough canvass, and his friends 
both white and black, Democrats and 
Republicans’ are doing the same thing. 
He is a young man with a clean record 
and his ability is unquestioned. When 
you cast your ballot on November 7th 
see that it is marked thus: 


•

The man who has no business of his 
own, is not well prepared to dictate to 
other people as to how they should 
manage theirs. You cannot name the 
employes of a bank without controlling 
some of its capital stock.

Mr. H. T. Gordon, candidate for the 
office of superior judge, is well known 
to the voters of this county and city. 
He is identified with the religious and 
moral forces of the city, and is an elder 
in the Presbyterian church. His high 
standing in the legal profession is proof 
of his fitness for the exalted position 
to which he aspires. If elected', as he 
deserves to be,, he will carry to the 
bench qualifications and dignity of a 
high order. He is a citizen, Christian, 
lawyer, your neighbor, not a politician. 
Vote for him.

Messrs. R. T. Douglas and J. A. 
Weyley, who are .making a tour of the 
state in the interest of the candidacy 
of Hon. Franklin K. Lane, are in the 
city. They are very sanguine in the 
belief that Mr. Lane will be elected. 
They say Mr. Lane will poll a large 
colored vote in the northern part of the 
slate.

Church Members take 
part in Burning a Negro 
at the Stake. They have 
a Gala Time. 

The burning of Thomas Clark, col¬ 
ored, at the stake at Corinth, Miss., on 
Sunday, September 28th, adds another 
savage, brutal crime to the long chapter 
of bloody deeds that have made the 
south a field of blood, and brought 
shame and disgrace upon the whole 
country. For that unspeakable crime 
against the laws of God and of the 
nation no excuse can be offered in pal¬ 
liation, It was not prompted by a de¬ 
sire to punish crime, hut a desire to 
commit crime, to revel in human mis¬ 
ery, to show .their contempt for laws, 
for 'hu,man rights and civilized meth¬ 
ods. Corinth, which is a town of 2500 
inhabitants, is the seat of justice of 
Alcorn county and is a railroad center 
of considerable importance. . It has 
schools, churches, newspapers, tele¬ 
graph and telephone communication 
With the outsid eworld, yet with all of 
these .advantages the citizens of that 
town are still in the depths of barbar¬ 
ism, if the story they tell upon them¬ 
selves is tiue. The hour for the burn¬ 
ing was set at 3:30. This would give 
.the church people, women and children, 
an opportunity to take part in the aw¬ 
ful crime •without being forced to leave 
church service for the purpose. The 
citizens of the town and country that 
is the white people, turned out en 
masse. It was ar white man’s festival. 
So dense was the mass of humanity 
that the-officers of the law had to force 
a passage so that the trembling negro 
dragging heavy chains, could reach the 
place of execution. The mob was 
composed of thousands of men,.women 
and children. It-was a circus that they 
would not miss. The piteous moans of 
the victim as the crackling fire eat up 
his vitals and dried, up nis heart’s 
blood fell like music upon the ears of 
the'mob and was greeted .'with cheers. 
He was burned at* the gate of the 
negro cemetery, an attempt to insult 
the negro dead who had escaped moo 
hate and mob Torture. On the 
hill above, the bleaching bones of 
more; than 5000 federal soldiers slaugh¬ 
tered* by the ancestors of'" that very 
mob were silent witnesses of that 
crime against all law. Tney were 
martyrs to the cause of justice and 
equal rights. They died in vain. Scat¬ 
tered everywhere at the scene of that 
tragedy in long nameless trenches 
mingling with the common clay is the 
dust of twice as many southern soldiers 


whose lives God required as a sacrifice 
for the wrongs their fathers had 
heaped upon a defenseless race. Per¬ 
chance. that iron stake to which the 
negro was chained .was driven through 
the remains of a confederate soldier. 
They too were mute witnesses and 
their sad fate offered a silent protest. 
It was heartless shocking, cruel, in¬ 
human beyond, the power of language 
to describe. * It is a crime the depth 
of which none but God can fathom 
and perhaps nothing but an eternal 
relentless hell can punish. They set 
going a conflagration in human flesh 
that like Pelee will sweep the whole 
country, for the spirit of the mob has 
already gone beyond the power of the 
government to check. These people 
go to church and pray to whom? They 
know not God; .respect no law. They 
live in houses, have schools and have 
the full protection of the very laws 
that they freat with scorn. They vote 
for officers to rule a country whose 
constitution and laws they hold in 
utter contempt and by whose savage 
deeds it has been made the leper of 
nations. , ; 

If Clark was guiity he deserved and 
would have the severest penalty 
known to our laws. No negro crim¬ 
inal ever escapes in that section if 
once he falls into the clutches of the 
officers of the law. According to the 
laws of this country he is innocent, 
having never been proven guilty. The 
story of his confession comes from the 
foulest gang of heartless, cold-blooded 
murderers that ever breathed the 
breath of life. They never fail to get 
a confession when one is needed. They 
torture a confession from the defense¬ 
less victim—they torture him. for. con¬ 
fessing. Their victims are-black and 
the laws of this country do not pro¬ 
tect the blacks. This is" a sau condi¬ 
tion. When will it end? What is to 
be the outcome of this increasing law¬ 
lessness and savagery among the 
white people? The responsibility foi 
this awful state of affairs lies at 
the -door of every white voter in 
this country. Every one of them 
was a partaker in that crime if 
not, then this is not a republic, gov¬ 
ernment by the majority, but a gov¬ 
ernment by a savage, lawless minority. 
What have the American people done 
to bring the perpetrators of these aw¬ 
ful crimes to justice. What protest 
have they offered against this whole¬ 
sale violation of their constitution and 
laws? Absolutely nothing. 


Mr. G.E. Cummings has opened a new 
and second-hand ■ store house at 234 
East Second street, where he buys and 
sells all kinds of new and second-hand 
stoves and kitchen utensils. He also 
buys and sells junk in large or small 
quantities. Those wishing to buy or 
sell goods in his line will do well to 
£ive him a call. 


INDEPENDENT CLUB ORGANIZED. 

The organization of an independent 
club by a number of intelligent colored 
citizens is a movement in the right di¬ 
rection. This club, which bids fair to 
be the most important organization 
among colored voters looking to their 
advancement, is composed of many of 
the leading business and professional 
men of the city. There will be branch or¬ 
ganizations in Pasadena and neighbor¬ 
ing towns. The feeling among the col¬ 
ored voters that independent political 
actions own their part is necessary, is 
the prevailing one. In independent po¬ 
litical action lies the negro’s future po¬ 
litical hope. The negro’s identity as

REV. DONOHOE. 

Nine out of every ten members of the 
Wesley chapel M. E. church want a 
change of pastor. Among these are the 
working members or supporters of that 
church. The immediate resignation of 
the pastor, Rev. Donohoe, would be a 
graceful act on his part. The mere fact 
that the pastor requires the aid of the 
police force in holding down his pul¬ 
pit shows that his congregation is 
against him- The continuation of his 
pastorate under police protection may 
result in the conversion of the police 
force, a thing the city would doubtless 
pay for, but his congregation wouldn’t. 
In this unfortunate affair the pastor is 
wrong. We say this with no ill feelings 
toward him. The majority is against 
him. Right is against him. His hope 
lies in bis resignation. 

- O'---—:: 

If the negro hopes to enjoy the con¬ 
fidence and respect of the white people 
who control the affairs of this commu¬ 
nity, he will have to make better use 
of his money than giving so-called 
“swell entertainments,” picnics and ex¬ 
cursions. We had rather record the 
purchase of a single one-room cabin by 
a negro than tell of a himured “swell” 
entertainments when we know that 
these entertainments mean the useless 
sacrifice of many weeks’ wages. The 
negro who buys a nome, it matters not 
how humble, exhibits intelligence ahd 
self-respect that counts, gives a bond 
for his good behavior and lays the 
foundation for a citizenship that his 
country will recognize. 

—--o—-- 

The attempt to put-all negroes on a 
common level by the negroes them¬ 
selves works a great hardship upon 
.those who are laboring for the ad¬ 
vancement of the race. The man who 
tries to do something receives no more 
credit than the vagabond who does 
nothing. The man who succeeds has 
to do so with the ocicis all against him 
and succeeds to still be a common ne¬ 
gro in the estimation of those whose 
plaudits he ought to have gained.

The fights over crap games in this 
city have been called off to get out of 
the way of church fights. When it 
comes to a fight over a good paying pul. 
pit the crap shooter ain’t in it.

One of the crying needs of the col¬ 
ored people of this city is the owner¬ 
ship of homes and farm's. If our peo¬ 
ple hope to command the respect of 
their whito feLow citizens they must 
become self-supporting taxpayers. Re¬ 
ligion, character and self-reliance will 
make a place for any people. The re¬ 
ligion that does not teach morality, in¬ 
dustry and frugality is a religion with¬ 
out a god.

The awful tragedy at Birmingham, 
Ala., by which 115 people lost their 
lives, is one -of those occurences that 
are not confined to any people. No 
class is exempt from them. Although 
there have been many such catastro¬ 
phes among the white people, this is 
the first on record among the colored. 
Near Birmingham only a few days pre¬ 
vious an excursion train left the track 
while running at a high rate of speed 
and killed 30 colored passengers. Ala¬ 
bama is not a good place for colored 
visitors this year.
