The Door of Hope Closed to the Negro by the Progress 
sive Party, Thoughtful Negroes have no 
Reason to Support Bull Moose Ticket 


There may be a few—and a 
mighty few—individuals here and 
there on the Progressive State 
ticket that colored voters can vote 
for; but they have nothing in com¬ 
mon with the Progressive ticket 
as a whole, whether State or 
Nationoh While disfranchising 
thousands of white voters in this 
State, the "Progressives, which is 
nothing more than a Lissner-John- 
son machine, have absolutely 
closed the “Door of Hope' 7 to the 
Negro voters throughout the State. 
As for Governor Johnson, vice- 
presidential candidate on the Pro¬ 
gressive National ticket, he has 
given the colored voters less con¬ 
sideration than any other gover¬ 
nor in the past twenty years. 
Gov. Johnson has not only not 
given the colored voters, who sup¬ 
ported him, representation in mak¬ 
ing his thousands of appointments 
but has taken from them the only 
decent paying job they had. 

The position of Governor’s messen¬ 
ger was created by Gov. Budd, a 
Democrat, and given to Mr. John 
Wiley, one of his Negro suppor¬ 
ters. During the administrations 
of Governors Gage, Pardee and 
Gillett, the position, was held by 
a Negro, and, owing to the increased 
responsibility of the position, the 
salary was raised from $100 to 
$125 per month. Gov. Johnson 
has seen fit to give the place to a 
white man, despite the fact that 
there were a number of worthy 
Negro applicants for the position, 
who had loyally supported the 
Governor when a candidate. The 
only logical conclusion the Negroes 


could reach in the matter was that 
the governor undoubtedly consid¬ 
ered the pay too high for a Negro. 

Having absolutely ignored the 
colored voters of this State, if 
there is any reason why they should 
support Gov. Johnson and his 
Progressive National ticket, we 
would like to know it! The Gov¬ 
ernor has seen to it that every 
class of voters were cared for ex¬ 
cept the Negroes. What is true 
in regards to the Governor is equally 
true of every man on his Congres¬ 
sional and Electoral ticket—they 
do not regard the Negro as a citi¬ 
zen. 

The Negro Ignored by this City 
and County Officials. 

The actions of the City and 
county government under the Pro¬ 
gressive rule is so in keeping with 
that adopted by the governor, 
that it shows that the policy 
of ignoring the Negro has been 
well digested and agreed upon. 
Without the Negro vote, Mayor 
Alexander would have, long ago, 
passed from the political memory 
of men. That vote saved him when he 
ran independently against Lauder 
for supervisor. It saved him and 
the Good Government ticket when 
a candidate for mayor against 
Smith and the so-called machine. 
And all that the Negro voters have 
received at the hands of the mayor 
and his party, has been a loss of 
positions they held under the city 
government, when the mayor was 
swept by their votes into power, 
and a lowering of their standing 


as citizens. In order to cheat the 
Negroes out of their rights, the 
civil service has been juggled and 
the color line drawn in the public 
service. 

When Hon. M. P. Snyder, a 
democrat from North Carolina, 
was mayor of this city, he put 
the Negroes in both the police 
and fire departments. He put 
them into parks and used his in¬ 
fluence to get them into the street 
department. It was with his sup¬ 
port and during his administra¬ 
tion that civil service was adopted 
by the city. 

Owing to the policy of fair play 
adopted by Mr. Jas. Hanly, an¬ 
other democrat, the city employed 
in the street department, more 
than a dozen teams owned by 
colored men. 

This continued until Mayor 
Alexander and the Good Govern¬ 
ment bunch got possession of the 
city government. As soon as the 
so-called Progressives got complete 
control of the city, in spite of the 
fact that the colored employees 
had proven themselves in every 
way worthy of the confidence re¬ 
posed in them, they were sneaking- 
ly let out of the parks and their 
teams removed from the street 
department. The colored men in 
the fire and police departments are 
protected by civil service or they, 
too, would have been disposed of! 
It is the fixed policy of the Progrse- 
sive City government, that, re¬ 
gardless of fitness to hold posi¬ 
tions, carrying with them respon¬ 
sibility, the Negro citizens and tax 
payers shall be given only posi-

bunch took charge. This is equally recently declared for Wilson after position will be discussed at the 


true at the County Court House. 
Of the 260 regular clerks employed 
by the County, the Negroes have 
no representation. 

Such has been the contempt 
with which the Negro voters have 
been treated under the so-called 
Good Government crowd that when 
a colored girl, some months ago, 
applied for admission to the nurse 
training school of the County Hos¬ 
pital, she was refused solely on 
account of the color of her skin. 
Yet the nurse training school of 
the County Hospital is a public 
institution, supported by public 
taxation. 

These are about the only induce¬ 
ments that Gov. Johnson and his 
party, the Progressives, have held 
out to the Negroes for their sup¬ 
port. And it is safe to say that 
nine-tenths of the thoughtful Ne¬ 
groes of the state will, with the 
regular republicans, cast their votes 
against the Bull Moose ticket in 
this state. To do otherwise would 
be an endorsement of the treat¬ 
ment they have received. If the 
Negro finds the Progressives, with 
whom he lives, closing the “Door 
of Hope” in his face, what can he 
hope to gain by putting them in 
control of the National govern¬ 
ment?

JOHNSON FOR WILSON 


Father of the Governor is Against 
His Own Son 


(By Direct Wire to the Times) 
Sacramento, Oct. 8—)Exclusive 
Dispatch.) Grove L. Johnson, 


the Taft electoral ticket was ruled 
off the ballot. Mr. Johnson says 
in his letter; “I read with much 
pleasure this morning that you 
would announce through your 
paper that Republicans should vote 
for Wilson so as to rebuke the 
wicked theft of the Republican 
party by the Bull Moose State 
Convention. I think every Re¬ 
publican newspaper in the State 
should follow your example. En¬ 
closed I send you a copy of reso¬ 
lutions adopted by our Republican 
Club here, some two hundred 
strong, last Wednesday night. 
I think such resolutions should be 
adopted all over the State. I have 
not voted the Democratic ticket 
since 1875. But this year, I shall 
and believe that a majority of the 
voters of California will do like¬ 
wise.” 


INTERESTING MEETING OF 
THE MINISTER’S ALLIANCE. 
BISHOP CALDWELL SPEAKS. 


An unusually large number of 
ministers and visitors assembled 
at the Y. M. C. A. building, Tues¬ 
day morning attracted by the 
announcement that Bishop Cald¬ 
well of the A. M. E. Zion church, 
one of the most distinguished pul¬ 
piteers of the race, would speak. 
President Kinchon was away at¬ 
tending the conference at Long 
Beach. Vice-President Harris 
presided. Secretary McPherson 
was out on his district. His sta¬ 
tion was filled by Rev. Ramsey. 
The reports made by the pastors 
were, as usual, helpful and interest¬ 
ing. Many pastors reported in¬ 
creased attendance and higher 
spiritual fervor. 

Resolutions of respect and es¬ 
teem for Rev. and Mrs. Tillman, 
recently of Pasadena, were read 
and adopted. Earnest expres¬ 
sions of good will and esteem were 
made concerning the reverend and 
his most excellent wife. A reso- 


next meeting. After the business 
session the president introduced 
Bishop Caldwell who delivered a 
most forcefull address on, “The 
Problems of the Church in the 
West.” His masterly treatment 
of this subject evidenced the keen 
investigation and close study of 
many of the matters of church 
progress in this section. The ex¬ 
tensive travels of the bishop through 
all sections of the country placed 
him in position to make interest¬ 
ing and effective comparisons of 
the churches throughout the coun¬ 
try and the spirit of the people 
toward them. In his conclusion 
he said that California furnished 
a problem singular and peculiar 
but cheered the ministers as he 
said that he had been impressed 
by the alliance that we were taking 
the right steps toward its fortunate 
solution. His remarks were round¬ 
ly cheered and a vote of thanks 
extended. 

Rev. Jas. A. Stout will address 
the alliance next Tuesday on the 
subject: “Ancient Theology in the 
Light of Modern Science.” 


Will Speak at the Lyceum 

Rev. Geo. Ringo, democratic 
candidate for Congress from the 
10th Congressional district will 
speak at the Lyceum, Sunday, 
Oct. 13th. Invitations have been 
extended to the Progressive and

pected to be present and speak. 
Every body is cordially invited.

THE NEGRO AND PROHIBI¬ 
TION 

By Dr. Booker T. IVasbington 

Long years of observation have 
convinced me that strong drink 
is one of the worst evils that beset 
the Negro. If the money they 

































THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


spend annually for strong drink 
was invested in property their 
wealth would be increased each 
year by millions of dollars. 

Ever since prohibition has been 
agitated in the South I have been 
greatly interested in it and have 
watched closely its effect upon the 
Negro. My own observations and 
the best information that I can 
obtain convince me that prohibi¬ 
tion is a good thing for the Negro. 
Under prohibition he generally 
drinks less whisky than he does 
when he has access to licensed 
saloons. I am reliably informed 
that since the restriction of the 
sale of liquor in South Carolina 
drinking has visibly decreased 
among the Negroes. In Alabama 
since prohibition went into effect 
the amount of liquor consumed by 
the colored people has been greatly 
reduced. This I have observed 
to be especially true in my own 
county. 

Another thing that prohibition 
does is to enable the Negroes to 
save more of their money. In a 
single court in Alabama since pro¬ 
hibition has gone into effect the 
fines imposed upon Negroes have 
decreased fifty per cent, annually. 
This means that these same Negroes 
will have that much more money 
to spend for food, for clothing and 
to invest in property. 

Another thing that prohibition 
has done is to diminish crime. 

I find that it is true that wherever 
there is prohibition crime among 
the colored people has decreased. 
Chief Justice Walter Clarke, of 
the Supreme Court of North Caro¬ 
lina, says that since the State-wide 
prohibition law has gone into effect 
in that State crime has been reduced 
fifty per cent. Murder in the first 
degree in North Carolina decreased 
twenty-two per cent; burglary, 
twenty per cent; attacks with dead¬ 
ly weapons, thirty per cent; lar¬ 
ceny, thirty per cent; manslaughter 
twenty-five per cent; murder in 
the second degree (thirty five 
per cent. In some instances, ac¬ 
cording to Chief Justice Clark, 
crimes have decreased more than 
sixty per cent since prohibition. 

I find that in Columbus, Ga., 


Negro arrests after prohibition 
went into effect decreased twenty- 
six- per cent. 

I recently made an investiga¬ 
tion of the effects of prohibition 
upon crime in Alabama. I sent 
out inquiries to sheriffs, chiefs of 
police and recorders of police courts, 
asking their opinion as to the chief 
cause of Negro crime and the effects 
of prohibition on Negro crime. 
The majority of these replies show 
that strong drink is the chief cause 
of crime among the Negroes of 
the State. These statements are 
corroborated by the report of the 
State Attorney-General, which 
shows that fifty three per cent of 
all murders in the State were due 
to strong srink. 

The effects of prohibition on 
crime among the people of my race 
in many cases were remarkable. 
In my own county in Alabama 
crime has been reduced sixty per 
cent since prohibition went into 
effect in the county four years ago. 
In many other counties in the 
State there has been a like reduc¬ 
tion in the amount of crime since 
the advent of prohibition. When 
everything, therefore, is considered, 
it appears that prohibition is an 
excellent thing for the Negro.

ALL FOR WILSON 


The political tide of this state 
as well as the country at large is 
flowing toward Woodrow Wilson 
for president of the United States; 
each day adding to the volume of 
the tide. Gov. Wilson’s chances, 
to carry this state, are indeed flatter¬ 
ing. The disfranchisement of tens 
of thousands of Republicans, by 
the Progressive machine of this 
state, has driven them into the 
Wilson camp; and every voter 
who believes in the absolute right

LETTER 


At the request of the Legue we 
mailed a big bunch of the Julian 
Harris letters to the Independent 
Politican League at El Dorado, 
Kansas. Since the publication in 
this journal of Atty. Wickliffe’s 
address to Col. Roosevelt there has 
been a steady demand for the 
Julian Harris letter. Hon. Theo. 
W. Jones, ex-commissioner of Cook 
County, Ill, is president of the 
Independent Political League. 


Mr. Jones is rendering the race 
splendid service. 


MR. FRANK H. MOUSER 

The election of Mr. Mouser to 
the legislature is no longer a doubt. 
His splendid run at the primaries 
demonstrated his popularity. He 
received 720 votes more than his 
nearest competitot, and had a 
majority of 160 over his four com¬ 
petitors. At the late Progressive 
convention, Mr. Mouser secured 
the adoption of a plank in their 
platform pledging a minimum wage 
for women in all industrial occupa¬ 
tions. He has been a resident of 
California 23 years and was edu¬ 
cated in the public schools here. 
He is, therefore, in every sense, 
a Californian. Besides The Lib¬ 
erator's support, Mr. Mouser has 
the loyal support of both Revs. 
Jones and Hubbard, late candi¬ 
dates before the primaries.

THE LYCEUM HOLDS AN IN¬ 
TERESTING SESSION 

The discussion of current topics 
at the Lyceum last Sunday covered 
a wide range and was the most 
interesting that has been witnessed 
there for a long time. The dis¬ 
cussions were full of good sense 
and sparkled with wit and humor 
on both sides. The discussion of 
the defeat of the Grandfather 
Clause at the recent election in 
Arkansas brought out the fact that 
the Prohibitionist and white moral 
forces did everything in their 

power to disfranchise the 
colored brothers. The Democrats 
refused to put the Grandfather 
clause in their platform. That 

clause being opposed by prominent 
democrats throughout the state. 

The colored men are learning with 
sincere regret that too often the 
moral forces among the white 

people are among the first to deny 
them equal opportunity to im¬ 
prove their condition. There seems

THE GREATNESS OF THE OLIVE IS THE 
GREATNESS OF GIBRALTAR. The advance 
of California land values is the advance of GIB¬ 
RALTAR. The strength of co-operation is the 
strength of GIBRALTAR AND IS BACK OF 
THE EARNING POWER OF YOUR DOLLAR. 
1287 SHAREHOLDERS are back of GIBRALTAR 
and have given it the weight of their approval. 
The largest olive nurseries in the world are joined 
to the greatest prosperity of the olive industry 
which this country has ever known in assuring 
big profits on every dollar invested. Subdividing 
land and selling orchards planted from our im¬ 
mense stock of growing olive and orange trees 
are a big factor in assuring the sale of stock for 
15c by January 1. PREFERRED STOCK IS 
UNLIMITED IN SHARING ALL GREATER 
PROFITS BEYOND THE 8% GUARANTEED.
