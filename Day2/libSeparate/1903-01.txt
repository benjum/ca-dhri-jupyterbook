MR. JAMES M. VENA. 


Hr. Vena’s Great Speech 
Introducing Booker T. 
Washington at Simp= 
son Auditorium. 

cMr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen :— 
At the beginning of the new year, it 
is very appropriate to assemble our¬ 
selves together in council, to review 
the past, and make expression of our 
hopes for the future. The solution of 
problems that have confronted civiliza" 
tion has required the bright minds of 
the ablest men, guided by experiences 
in the. past, in order to more success¬ 
fully combat the solution of questions 
that naturally arise, aad concern the 
welfare of mankind. 

The problem that assembles this aud¬ 
ience tonight, is one that has for cen¬ 
turies puzzled the minds of the greatest 
statesmen, scholars and philantroptaist9, 
through whose efforts many of the ob¬ 
stacles have been overcome. 

The history of the Negro In America, 
the world knows by heart, and it is not 
mv province at this time to enter into 
that discussion in detail. 


While he has his vices he also has his 
virtues. Being deprived for centuries 
of the results of his labor, with no op¬ 
portunity for advancement along moral 
and educational lines, may be offered in 
extenuation of some of his failures. 

His patriotism, and devotiun to his 
country, has been so great, regardless 
of conditions, that no spirit of anarchy 
has ever entered his breast. His 
loyalty in peace, and his bravery in 
war, attests his full appreciation of the 
present greatness, and future possibili¬ 
ties of this government, that has raised 
him to the high plane of citizenship, 
and around whose form they have drawn 
the sacred circle of the constitution, a 
document so glorous and so grand, 
that the better elements of all races 
aod sections, who are now joining 
hands to uphold it, will make this coun¬ 
try the paradise dreamed of by our 
forefathers, when acquiesed in by their 
sons. 

Hospitable and industrious America, 
may no ill-fate ever impede t y present 
progress. Fertile in her soil, abundant in 
her harvests, thriving in her manufac¬ 
tories, active in commerce, exact in 


business, beautiful in her streams, ma“ 
jestic in her mountains, glorious in her 
freedom, Christlike in her religion, she 
stands today, the most conspicuous star 
in that galaxy of civilized nations; and 
from her schools and colleges have em¬ 
anated fair women and brave men of 
the humblest families, whose intellect¬ 
ual endowments have revolutionized 
the world. She has produced a Frank¬ 
lin, a Morse, an Edison, a Lincoln, a 
Grant, a Sherman in war and a Sher¬ 
man in peace. She has produced a 
Sumner, a Roosefelt. She produced a 
man from the humblest walks of life, 
through whose executive guidance 
Cuba has been freed, and the stars and 
stripes with American civilization wave 
over in Puereto Rico, and the Philli- 
pine Islands. Sacred be the memory 
of the late William McKinley. 

Her sunny south, once rank with 
weed and thistle, blooms today in one 
vast held of cotton. Her colder north 
buds in fields of waving grain. Indus¬ 
try and thrift have usurped the places 
of idleness in the east, and beneath the 
bareness of our western hills lie con' 
cealed some of the richest mines of 
earth. 

America, with all thy faults we love 
thee still. In order to proove onrselves 
worthy of this boon of citizenship per¬ 
haps more than any other class of citi¬ 
zens, we have followed Literallv the 
teachings of Jesus Christ; smitten on 
one cheek, we have turned the other to 
the smitter, robbed of our coat at law, 
we have given up our cloak also; nailed 
to the cross of public scorn with the 
spikes of public hate, we have said of 
these American Caesars, “Father for¬ 
give them for they know not what they 
do.” 

Tbe remarkable advancement the 
Negro has made, struggling against ad¬ 
verse circumstances, is unprecedented 
in the annals of history. His wonderful 
acquisition of wealth and intelligence 
in such a brief period speaks well for 
his possibilities in the future. And the 
fact, that he has overcome so many ob¬ 
stacles, apparently unsurmountable in 
the past, entitles him to a fair chance 
for life, liberty and the pursuit of hap¬ 
piness. 

In his struggle for these rignts, I 
would say to the black man, with apolo¬ 
gies to Rudyard Kipling: 












THE LIBERATOR. 




“Take up the black man's burden, 

Send forth the best ye breed, 

To tell the world we’re rising 
To teach, to pray, to plead. 

When weighed, be not found wanting, 
What’s done, is not undone, 

For conflicts yet arising 
Just gird your armor on.” 

And, likewise to the white man, I 
would say: 

“Take up the black man’s burden, 

Don't curse him in advance. 

He cannot lift a white man’s load 
Without a white man’s chance. 

When yours, his chances equals, 

Give him the strictest test, 

Then, hands off, he your motto, 

And he will do the rest.” 

I highly appreciate the honor confer¬ 
red upon me by the colored citizens of 
Southern California of having the privi¬ 
lege of presenting to this audience a 
man, who has accomplished more per¬ 
haps than any other one man in the past 
century, to bring about a peaceful solu¬ 
tion of one of the most intricate prob¬ 
lems that has ever confronted the 
American public. 

The affairs of nations as well as indivi¬ 
duals strengthen my belief that “there 
is a divinity ihat shapes our ends rough 
hew them how we will.” During the days 
just preceding and following the eman¬ 
cipation we had a champion, remarkable 
for his gifts; who, soaring aloft in the 
infinite space of philosophy, culling the 
truths which history and ethics teach 
and using them as battering rams to 
break down the bulwarks of prejudice 
reared against his race, grand and mas¬ 
terful was Frederick Douglas. When 
the fortunes of war and the policy of 
statesmen had changed these con¬ 
ditions we had the fearless Langston. 
But as time speed on and the 
passions and sentiments engendered 
by that conflict had subsided and the 
people seemed in their “madning rush” 
to forget that the question involved was 
one of evolution, there came upon the 
stage of action, a man endowed with all 
the worthy faculties of our former lead¬ 
ers, with advanced ideas carrying prac¬ 
tical benefits, that is bringing to our 
assistance the humanitarians of the 
world. That man is Booker T. Wash¬ 
ington whom I now introduce to you. 


Don’t forget to buy all of your 
Musical Instruments. from the 
dealers who advertise in the 
Liberator. The friends of the 
race are those who patronize race 
enterprises. Those firms want 
your trade and will treat your 
fairly. 



MU. A. u. BILLIPS. 

Mr, A, D. Billips, door man of the 
Angelus Hotel, who came here recently 
from Salt Lake City, adds another worthy 
young man to the fraternity of hotel men 
in this city, Mr. Billips is an old hotel man, 
having served from every capacity from a 
bell boy to head waiter. He has been in 
the employ of Mr. Holmes, proprietor of 
the Angelus, for eighteen months. At Salt 
Lake City Mr, Billips was identified with 
the intelligent progressive people, and 
served four terms as president of the 
Dumas Literary Society. He is a native of 
Chattanooga, Tenn., and is a tanner by 
trade, having engaged several years in 
that business. For his mother he has pro¬ 
vided a home at Chattanooga. Mr. Billips 
is widely read, especially in race literature, 
He knows the value cf the papers, and sup¬ 
ports them generously. He is door man of 
the Spring street entrance 01 the Angelus. 
His ehances for promotion are good, in 
which event other colored men will be em¬ 
ployed. Mr. Billips is proud of his posi¬ 
tion, this of itself, is one of the .essentials 
to success, whatever your calling. With¬ 
out love for your occupation you canftot 
hope to reach the top. He is a worthy 
young man. 


Business and Personal. 

Mr. B. R. Randolph, our popu¬ 
lar policeman, is the happy pos¬ 
sessor of a handsome and tuneful 
Behr Bros, piano, recently pur¬ 
chased of Williamson Bros, 


Mr. E. G. Hill has bought out the 
Original L. A. Rubbish company. He 
makes a specialty of store, stable and 
yard cleaning. His office is 236 San 
Pedro street. Phone John 4371. Miss 
Pearl Boggs, a graduate of the high 
school, has charge of the office. By his 
industry, economy and enterprise Mr. 
Hill gives employment to a number of 
colored persons. This and the owner¬ 
ship of a splendid house adds to the 
value of his race. 

* :J: * * * 

Mr. Wm. McClain has sold his busi¬ 
ness here and will soon move to his 
valuable farm at Imperial. 

* * * * * 

Prof. Jas. C. Moore, formerly head of 
the industrial school for colored youths 
at Knoxville, Tenn., has become a resi¬ 
dent of this city. Prof. Moore is a 
Booker T. Washington and will .make 
us a very desirable citizen. The Libera¬ 
tor extends him a hearty welcome. 

* * * * sis 

Mr. G. W. Albright, the well known 
orator and proprietor of the Dayton 
Heights grain mill and wood yard, is 
now grinding out eloquence that never 
fails to reach people’s pockets, as well 
as their hearts. He grinds first-class 
corn meal and furnishes wood to cook 
it. He is regarded as one of the im¬ 
portant citizens of his community and 
although his family is the only colored 
•one there he has held the position of 
school trustee in his district several 
years. His P. 0. address is Station E. 

* * $ * S*t 

Mr. I. Beal, a wealthy colored rancher 
of Redlands, came to this city to hear 
Prof. Booker T. Washington. He went 
to Pasadena and heard him there also. 
The round trip was something like 150 
miles. He says the lecture was worth 
a journey of 1000 miles. 

* * * * $ 

Mr. Edward Bellamy is building a 
$1900 cottage on his lot at 842 15th 
street. He is an enterprising young 
man with an eye to business. Go 
ahead, brother. 

:1s * * * * 

Mr. H. Burdette has been reappointed 
to his position in the park. He is a de¬ 
serving man and was not overlooked. 
He made a hard fight for Mr. Lauder 
in the Seventh ward and took his de¬ 
feat hard. If Burdette had had his way 
the whole republican ticket would have 
gone through. 

* * * * * 

Rev. G. R. Bryant, the new pastor of 
Wesley chapel, has made a very favor¬ 
able impression. He urges the people 
to educate their children, buy homes, 
engage in business and employ them¬ 
selves. He believes that religion makes 
people honest, proud, industrious and 
economical. This is mighty pound 
preaching. Now, we have no faith in 
the religion of the fellow wlio wants 
nothing till he dies. He will catch 
what the poor devil did who hid his 
talents.

THE TIMES. 

The editorial in the Times of 
14th inst., under the caption of 
“No Color Line,” is characteristic 
of that gTeat journal. It em¬ 
phatically endorses the manly 
course of the President in doing- 
his sworn duty. The constitu¬ 
tion recognizes neither race or 
color, and the President is sworn 
to obey its mandates. This he 
has bravely determined to do and 
he is not a man to shirk a duty. 
The President is right. His posi¬ 
tion impregnable. The Negroes 
are citizens of the United States, 
and as they become fitted, will 
either enjoy of the rights guar¬ 
anteed by the constitution or the 
white men will not enjoy them. 

Caste prejudice and our nation¬ 
al constitution cannot live on the 
same territory. One or the other 
must go. 

The appointments of Messrs. 
Crumb of South Carolina, and W. 
H. Lewis of Boston, Mass., were 
made solely on the grounds of 


their fitness, and for the white 
people of Boston or Charleston to 
raise objections solely on account 
of their color, would show that 
the citizens are too ignorant too 
understand the meaning of the 
constitution or are unwilling to 
obey it. 

The position of the Times on 
the so-called race problem is just 
and must prevail. 

The Times says:— 

“If the colored race will faithfully 
follow the guidance of Booker T. Wash¬ 
ington, and will make a concerted and 
earnest effort to raise itself in the 
plane of civilization and enlightenment, 
it will not be many years before it will 
be found giving the white race plenty 
of competition in the field of intellectual 
achievement. When the negro race shall 
thus have advanced itself, through its 
own efforts, its recognition in affairs of 
government will come as an undeniable 
right, and not as a favor. In the mean¬ 
time, with a ,man like Theodore Roose¬ 
velt in the presidential chair, colored 
men need have no fear that their just 
claims will be ignored. They should 
not, however, ask for nor expect recog¬ 
nition in any capacity, on the ground 
that they are colored men. They should 
keep steadily in view the grandeur and 
the prestige of American citizenship, 
and should constantly aim to make 
themselves more and more worthy of 
the honors and responsibilities which 
American citizenship confers. 

Colored men, cut this out and paste 
it in your hats. Read it to your chil¬ 
dren. 

-o- 

ANOTHER OUTRAGE. 

At Indianola, Miss,, a few days ago, 
Mrs. Cox, colored postmistress, had to 
resign her position to keep the white 
men of that town from murdering her 
in the streets. Her only crime was that 
of being black. She has held the posi¬ 
tion for a number of years, and had 
given entire satisfaction, in fact the 
town has never had a more worthy and 
efficient officer. But she was black and 
had no rights that Mississippi whites 
are bound to respect. Since the presi¬ 
dent announced his intention to recog¬ 
nize only fitness in making federal ap¬ 
pointments, the mob which runs things 
in the South has decided to force his 
colored appointees to resign or murder 
them without regard to age or sex. It 
is up to the president whether the mob 
succeeds. The office has been closed 
and should remain closed until the citi¬ 
zens of that town agree to protect Mrs. 
Cox in the lawful exercise of her duty. 

If they are unable to do this let them 
say so. The murder and burning of 
Postmaster Baker and child of South 
Carolina and the heartless, cold-blooded 
shooting of his wife and daughters as 
they fled from the burning postoffice is 
fresh in the minds of the people. Ben 
Tillman, the mob leader, went to Presi¬ 


dent McKinley and gave him to under¬ 
stand that if Baker was appointed he 
Baker, would be killed. Baker was ap¬ 
pointed, Tillman kept his word. The 
office was closed, but at the demand of 
the mob President McKinley reopened 
it. The success of the mob was com¬ 
plete and though well-known, its mem¬ 
bers went unwhipped by justice. The 
same spirit that murdered ^Balger^anft 
his innocent child iff c<Jl* tfbod and 
maimed for life his defenseless wife and 
daughter as they fled from the burning 
postoffice, because they were black; 
murdered the great William McKinley’ 
because he was president. Baker and 
family were butchered because he held 
an office, President McKinley was 
murdered in cold blood because he held 
an office. Both men were federal offi¬ 
cers and were shot down without mercy. 

1 he wife of one of them is amply pro¬ 
vided for by a government pension; 
the other, Mrs. Baker, subsists upon 
charity. The men who will murder 
a colored man because he holds a fed¬ 
eral office will murder a white man —a 
president—for the same reason. This 
has been proven. Shall history repeat 
itself? The actions of the white citi¬ 
zens of Indianola are treasonable in the 
extreme.

THE COLORED FARMERS WILL OR¬ 
GANIZE. 

The movement looking to the organ- 
ization of a n association to be made up 
of the colored men and women who are 
engaged in fruit growing, truck farm¬ 
ing, stock and poultry raising, is a 
good one, and should be encouraged. 
Scattered over Southern California are 
many colored persons engaged in these 
pursuits and an interchange of ideas 
by them in annual meetings would be 
very beneficial to all. Such an associa¬ 
tion with its annual meetings would 
arouse an interest in these pursuits that 
would increase the number of persons 
engaged in these profitable independ¬ 
ent occupations. This fact must not be 
lost sight of: That if the colored people 
here hope to hold their own they will 
have to depend more largely upon the 
soil. There are millions for them in 
truck gardening if they will only seize 
the opportunity that is lying at their 
feet. There is a ready market waiting 
for their productions. But the market 
will not always wait. Already com¬ 
panies of Japanese are making over¬ 
tures for lands for truck gardens. They 
mean business. By all means let us 
have the organization, let us buy and 
cultivate more land; let us by our pro¬ 
ductions make ourselves of such indls- 
pensible value to our communities that 
our presence cannot be dispensed with.

Messrs. Easton and Thoraton are do- 
well with their fish market. Professor 
Easton is a gentleman of splendid in¬ 
tellectual attainments. The attempt of 
some of his so-called friends to do him 
does the whole race an injury. Any 
ignoramous can burn a book, but only 
a scholar can write one.

President of the Afro-American State 
Council is one of the best known young 
men in Pasadena if not in Southern 
California. His election to the presi¬ 
dency of the state council was a well 
merited honor as he has been identified 
with every measure for the advance¬ 
ment of the Afro-American in the state. 
Mr. Prince enjoys the confidence of the 
business and leading citizens of his, 
city, which, of itself is a good certifi¬ 
cate of character. Besides his hand¬ 
some two story cottage on Vernon Ave„ 
he owns other valuable city property 
in Pasadena. He is priciple owner of 
the lot and building on Fourth street in 
this City, leased and occupied by the 
Enterprise Publishing Company, Of his 
investments the Fourth street property 
is the best of them ail. He is also 
business manager of the Enterprise 
Publishing Co.

PASADENA ENTERPRISE. 

That all of the colored people in 
Pasadena are busy is a healthful sign. 
Our people overe there have one black¬ 
smith shop, two tailoring establish¬ 
ments, two tonsorial parlors, one em¬ 
ployment office and many expressmen 
and up-to-date public carriages, two 
churches.pastored by two worthy young 
ministers. Mr. A. Hill, the tailor, has 
a well patronized tailoring establish¬ 
ment at 27 West Greet street. He makes 
a specialty of ladies’ tailoring and is 
meeting with much success in the de¬ 
partment, pressing, repairing, steam 
cleaning and dying departments have 
all of the work they can do. This is 
proof of satisfactory work. His estab¬ 
lishment is well kept, everything wear¬ 
ing a business air.

J. H. Griffin & Son, proprietors of the 


Enterprise Barber Shop and Employ¬ 
ment agency are doing a good bnsiness. 
Mr. Griffin is president of the Enter¬ 
prise Publishing Company. He is a 
g'ood business man and a staunch sup¬ 
porter of race enterprises. Although 
he came to Pasadena 12 or 15 months 
ago he owns a nice home and is there¬ 
fore a tax payer.

Rev. E. T. Hubbard paster of the A. 
M. E, chnrch of Pasadena, is the young¬ 
est minister on the coast. He is the son 
of Rev. J. H .Hubbard, presiding elder 
of the Denver district of the Colorado 
conference. As paster at Marysville and 
Bakersfield, Rev. Hubbard was very 
successful. He is doing a good work in 
Pasadena. He possesses a well cultivat¬ 
ed mind and is a forceful speaker and 
writer. He is progressive and can be 
relied upon in any matter for the ad¬ 
vancement of the race.. 

Mr. W. C. Dent’s Cosmopolitan ton¬ 
sorial parlor is one of the neatest in 
Pasadena and is patronized by the peo¬ 
ple of the better class. Mr. is superin¬ 
tendent of the Friendship Baptist 
church Sunday school and has been 
identified with those engaged in the 
religious and moral upbuilding of the 
city for a number of years. He is a 
working memeber of his church and a 
valued member of the Western Baptist 
Association.

REV. DONOHOO. 

With the sudden disappearance of 
Rev. Donohoo, the troubles of Wesley 
Chapel M. E. Church vanished. Since 
that happy event peace has settled up¬ 
on the congregation like gentle show¬ 
ers upon thirsty vegetation. It was a 
long stormy siege, in which the pastor 
exhibited some of the patience of Job, 
but be lacked the other car inal vir¬ 
tues of that revered patriarch. While 
Job’s patience are said to have been 
bound ess, he never claimed enough of 
that God-like virtue to attem t to 
preach to a congregation that did not 
want to he r him. I his Rev. Donohoo 
tried to do and failed. 

Rev. Dnnohoo reported to every 
scheme known to wire pulling pieach- 
ers to hold onto his job, bet to no pur- 
bose. He called in the police, that 
only made matters worse. He prayed 
but the God of peace never bpth s 
with a church row. Under the l$»det- 
ship of T. M McClellan, the meoifbets 
agreed to attend all meetings of: tl e 
church, but retire in a body whenever 
the pastor rise to speak. At this un¬ 
expected move the pastor was non¬ 
plussed. It was a contingency that 
neither prayer nor the police force 
could reach. As this last movement 
cut off the postoe’s salary, he changed 
his tactics and ordered a church rally 
to raise the money due on the organ, 
hoping to appropriate the amount col 
lected to his salary. Mr. McClellan 
spoiled the scheme by bringing an or¬ 
der from the music dealer, who sold the 
organ requesting the church to pay all 
money due on the organ to him. At 
this announcement the preacher called 
the rally off, and the people paid the 
money to Mr. McClellan. The pastor 
bravely held his own till night fall, 
then quietly pulled down his tent and 
left for parts more congenial. Allis 
peace now at the Wesley Chapel M. E. 
Church, and the church can hardly 
hold its congregation. For this, much 
is due to Messrs. McClellan, Eagle,. 
Jackson and Hill.

THE LJflERATOR. 


Toast,--“The Colored Press.” 

Responded by J. L. Edmunds, 
Editor of The Liberator, at the 
Banquet tendered Prof. Booker 
T. Washing-ton by the Colored 
Citizens of Los Ang-eles, at 
Simpson’s Auditnrium, January 
3, 1903. 

MR. TOASTMASTER. 
LADIES and GENTLEMEN: 

At no period in the history of this 
country has the press wielded a great¬ 
er influence in shaping- public senti¬ 
ment than now. Ill a country like 
ours where public sentiment is king^ 
the maker of this king holds a position 
of immense responsibility. Such is 
the responsibility that rests upon the 
American press today. If the press 
stands for lawlessness and vetialty, 
lawlessness and venalty reign. 

The present reign of the mob in this 
country is proof of the assertion. 

If it stands for God and righteous- 
ness,Jwhich implies justice and equal¬ 
ity of opportunity for all, the masses 
will be impaired by the hope of reward 
for well doing, and the movement will 
be upward, and the life of the nation 
lengthened. 

The owner of a number of what are 
known as “yellow journals” and who 
is making a financial success, is said 
to have remarked that “his success 
was due to the fact, he gave the people 
what they wanted;” in other words, 
he gave the children razors because 
they wanted them, and there was 
money in it. The danger of this class 
of journalists to the future well being 
of the country is apparent. Immoral, 
sensational literature should not be 
given to the people because they want 
it and are willing to pay for it. This 
applies with equal force to many other 
abuses and cannot be too well under¬ 
stood by the colored press, whose 
it is, not only to mold among the 
Negroes a sentiment that will tend to 
elevate them morally, intellectually 
and financially, but to present their 
case before the bar of public opinion, 
and stimulate in them those princi¬ 
ples of manhood that will bring them 
in sympathy ahd touch with their 
fellow-white citizens. 

The progress made by the colored 
press in character and ability has been 


great. It has done much for the elev, 
vation of the race and the country, 
but the race is still in the formative 
stage, so the greater part of the work 
is yet to be accomplished. We, as 
journalists, should see to it that the Ne¬ 
groes’ hopes are not built upon a fals3 
foundation The Negro must learn. 
That at the root, and underlying all 
success, is the ownership of character, 
intelligence, industry and the ability 
to produce somo of the needs of life. 
That to be self-supporting, is to be 
American. That no race ever dreamed 
itself into affluence. That the difficul¬ 
ties that now surround them lay 
across the path of every race that ever 
succeeded. The fact that the colored 
press is beginning to teach these 
things is a hopeful sign. The grow¬ 
ing independence of the colored press 
is another hopeful sign, for only when 
it is independent can it strike its hard¬ 
est blows for the cause for which it 
stands. As the press becomes inde¬ 
pendent, the scope of its influence 
broadens, its means of support break 
through racial aiid party lines. Anoth¬ 
er hopeful sign is, the increasing faith 
in the colored press by the people. 
This is shown by their increasing sup¬ 
port. Its need and value is beginning- 
to be understood and appreciated. 
Still, the lot of the colored uewspaper 
is to be a hard one for sometime to come, 
and the colored journalist who is no 
prepared to make sacrifices for th 
common advancement of the race, has 
missed his calling. 

In dealing with our people, their 
prejudices and inconsistencies furnish 
a problem that is at the bottom of 
many of our severest trials. Their 
love of show that too often has no 
solid foundation, love of cheap noter- 
iety,love for the superficial rather than 
the real, dislike of criticism, unwilling¬ 
ness to tolerate a difference of opinion, 
inabality to espouse a common cause, 
are a few of the difficulties that beset 
our path and retard our progress. 
The 3 r are outposts of ignorance and 
must be driven in. If the colored press 
is to be to the colored race what the 
white press is to the white race, these 
shortcomings will have to be met and 
dealt with stearnly. Those of us whom 
love of race and country has called to 
journalism, are exceedingly fortunate 
for we are laborers in the field that 
produces earth’s greatest harvest. Let 
us be faithful to our trust. Give the 


people what they need, and impress 
upon them that idleness, extravagence 
and shiftlessness are crimes. 

To live and labor for the elevation 
of men, is not to die. John Brown, 
Lincoln, Garrison, Lovejo 3 % Frederick 
Douglass and others of their kind, 
were,, indeed, fortunate. The 3 r will 
ever live in the happiness of those 
they helped to raise. 

Ours is a proud duty. We are citi¬ 
zens of a great county, and to assist 
in fittiug our race for the duties that 
this great citzenship imposes, is an 
honor that cannot be over-estimated. 
Let us,- therefore, put our shoulders to 
the wheel aud aid the white press in 
every endeavor for the advancement 
of the American people aud the per¬ 
petuity of American institutions.

SUPPLEMENT. 


THE LIBERATOR. 


Washington’s Great 
Ovation. 

The ovation tendered Booker T. 
Washington by the citizens of this 
city was unprecedented in its history. 
In their efforts to do honor to the 
great leader and apostle of industrial 
education the populace went mad. No 
visitor to this city ever aroused an 
enthusiasm so heart-felt, so wide and 
deep and universal as that aroused by 
Booker T. Washington. A wave of 
good feeling seemed to pervade all the 
air and the hearts of the people, re¬ 
gardless of race, color or condition 
beat in love and unison. Every one 
was possessed of the feeling that he 
was in the presence of a great person¬ 
age, whose love was as broad as hum¬ 
anity, and the desire to see him—to 
touch the hem of his garments be¬ 
came a passion. 

There is something wonderful about 
this great man that makes all the 
world around him akin. He seemed to 
be a member and leader of every race 
and each vied with the other in the 
manifestation of their love. His pre¬ 
sence appealed to the nobler senti¬ 
ments of the heart and every one 
leaves him with a love for humanity 
he never felt before. 

A writer in the Times speaks of him 
in part as follows: 

‘•Greatness Is simplicity and humble. 
Booker T. Washington is simple, humble 
and great. He is not great because he Is 
a black man, but in spite of it. Six thou¬ 
sand people listened to him here yesterday 
They gave rapt attention, and clamorous 
applause. He made three talks, and all 
who heard them departed impressed that 
they had been in contact with an exalted 
master of life, whose ideas are austere, 
but whose person is gentle. 

Mr. Washington says he does not like to 
lecture. Men born with great gifts often 
become disgusted with the exercise of 
those gifts. It is said that Shakespeare 
often regretted that he ever tried to write, 
as Michael Angelo cursed the day he be¬ 
came a sculptor. Lincoln said he was not 
an orator, yet today the public schools of 
England, Germany and Holland use his 
orations as texts for children. 

Mr. Washington is not a lecturer: he is 
an orator. He is also an economist, a phil¬ 
osopher, a coustructive statesmen, and a 
great leader of a people. His talk has 
dramatic sequence, and is pregnant with 
vitality. It is enthusiastic, bold, sincere. 
He forgets himself in his fervor. He 


launches himself out with sublime non¬ 
chalance, and he carries his audience with 
him. He thrusts his hands In his pockets; 
he lolls upon the desk; he mops his face 
with his handkerchief. 

But you do not notice it. You forge t he is 
a black man. He seems an inspired apostle 
to the whole human race. While speaking 
of the Negro, he is talking to all colors and 
creeds. It is as though a child with simple 
pratle had confounded schools and systems. 
The bootblack on the street can understand 
him. The flue gentleman applauds him. 
You bend double under LL witticisms. You 
are startled at bis absolute logic—yet all is 
simple—as simple as Abraham Lincoln, 
His terrible intensity seizes you. You 
could not escape if you wished, yet you 
love the man. His sympathy is universal, 
and through it all shines a cool, penetrat¬ 
ing reason that illumines his sentences as 
a glint of sunlight flashes up the facet of a 
diamond. 

AT HAZARD’S PAVILION. 

Mr. Washington was greeted by one 
of the most cultured audiences that 
ever assembled in the city. Besides 
the teachers of the State, ladies and 
gentlemen of high business, official 
and social circles packed the hall. To 
the editor of this journal, who was once 
a slave and witnessed many brutal 
deeds perpetrated upon fellow slaves 
by the brutal Overseer and his less 
savage companion the blood hound, 
the scene at Hazzard’s Pavilion was a 
strange one. Proud white women of 
high social standing deemed it an 
honor to take part in a program of 
which Washington was leading star. 
White men who in part control the 
offices of the City and State crowded 
upon the stage and deemed a seat 
there as not only an honor but a proud 
epoch in their lives. From the outset 
the speaker had that vast audience at 
his mercy, brave men and fair women 
laughed and cried by turns, storms of 
laughter succeeded by intense silence 
which in turn were broken by deafen¬ 
ing applause followed each other like 
wave on wave. As we looked upon 
that human ocean in a tempest, we 
could not resist exclaiming “what 
wonders God has wrought.” 

PROF. WASHINGTON AT SIMP¬ 
SON’S AUDITORIUM. 

If Prof. Washington ever faced an 
audience that was just what he wished 
it to be, it was the one that welcomed 
him at Simpson’s Auditorium Satur¬ 
day evening, January 3rd. To a com¬ 
mittee of colored gentlemen, headed 


by Dr. Taylor, Mr. Washington so 
lovingly said, “at that meeting I hope 
to meet as many of our people as pos¬ 
sible, especially the women who wash 
and iron and cook, the men who carry 
hods and black boots. I want to see 
and shake hands with all of the work¬ 
ing people.” It was a splendid aud¬ 
ience. The colored beople had turned 
out en masse, bringing with them as 
invited guests many of their white 
neighbors. Several white ladies sat 
by the side of their colored cook, and 
white men of leisure occupied seats 
with their colored coachmen and boot¬ 
blacks. It was strictly a cosmopolitan 
audience, one of the most beautiful we 
ever saw, with its white, black, brown 
and yellow faces. In spite of the fact 
that he had traveled nearly one hun¬ 
dred miles and made two speeches and 
had lobored 36 hours of the preceding 
48 hours, Mr. Washington was at his 
best when he rose to speak. He had 
come to his own and his own received 
him with applause and open arms. 
Persons who had heard all of his 
speeches, say that his speech to the 
colored people was the ablest and most 
earnest of his speeches. It was 
couched in the simplest language, but 
delivered in a manner that carried it 
to every heart, making a lasting im¬ 
pression. His appeal to the young 
people to learn trades, save their earn¬ 
ings, buy lands and homes and become 
self-supporting, will bear much fruit. 
His plea for the separation of the good 
from the bad will not go unheeded. It 
was great speech and fell like rain 
upon thirsfy soil. 

Mr. James Vena’s speech introduc¬ 
ing Mr. Washington, published else¬ 
where in these columns is a master. 
It was a credit to the occasion and a 
credit to its author. He is the local 
man of the hour. The vocal solo by 
Mrs. R. C. Owens and the piano solos 
by Misses Brown and Spikes were well 
rendered and were generousally ap¬ 
plauded. 

It was a great occasion, made so by 
the presence of the greatest man liv¬ 
ing, Fortunate indeed were those who 
composed the audience. 

PARAGRAPHS FROM HIS 
SPEECH DELIVERED AT 
THE AUDITORIUM. 

At Simpson Auditorium, Saturday night, 
Mr. Washington delivered a notable address 




THE LIBERATOR. 


on the Negro question. He spoke on that 
occasion in part as follows: — 

•*I want to express from the bottom of 
my heart the gratitude which I feel and 
experience this moment for the welcome 
extended since I set my foot on California 
soil. So general, so continuous, has the 
welcome been that I have had scarcely a 
moment to write my good wife. I have 
been pleased with the encouragement, the 
inspiration, with the hearty welcome I have 
received from your hands. I want to ex¬ 
press the satisiaction it has given me to 
hear from every hand the attainment of 
my people in Southern California, Some 
time ago in our part of the country, it is 
said, two unfortunate frogs jumped into a 
jar of milk one night. After several hours 
of floating about in the milk one of the 
frogs declared to his fellow that it was no 
use to try; they were doomed to stay. 
The second was full of hope, and was re¬ 
solved to get out; he kicked and kicked, un¬ 
til about three o’clock in the morning that 
milk had been churned into butter, and the 
two frogs walked out of that jar.” 

PRIDE OF RACE. 

“No race of people can ever get on its 
feet and stand there without pride of race. 
There is no race in this world to which I 
would rather belong or give greater honor 
than the black race. I belive the day is 
coming when every black man or woman 
will count it an honor to be one of that race. 
Every race goes through certain stages of 
growth. Some of us have to build palaces 
others to hew forests, but the palaces can¬ 
not be built without the forests are hewn. 
No race has ever gotten on its feet unless 
through the industrial, the economic pro* 
cess. 1 am trying to impress upon mv 
people that education has changed and is 
changing. Today, in addition to the old 
college curriculum we have added the 
sciences, domestic science and other bran¬ 
ches. Education has been tending toward 
bringing the indnstries in closer contract 
with matter, with life. We as a people, 
should cling to industrial education and 
put brains, and industry, and skill 
into our work. We should not shun the 
so-called lowly positions. Not all the white 
people are preachers or doctors; why should 
our people want to follow these two call¬ 
ings? Some of our people say to me. “I 
have been discriminated against.” If you 
are discriminated against in one thing, go 
at it and create some-thing for yourself. 
Get in a furrow and stand there if need be, 
without hat without shoes, bare-footed, but 
there until you wrestle success out of that 
furrow 

MATERIAL AND ETHICAL 

Now, you will say this relates to the 
material and overlooks the ethical. Just 
so much as we become owners of farmes, 
operators of industry, will we be able to 
s upport our ministers and others to minis¬ 


ter to the ethical. If a man today starts a 
farm or a industry and keeps it, his child¬ 
ren and his grand children can have the 
ethical advantage that he did not. I ad¬ 
vocate industrial education because it not 
only teaches our people how to work. It 
shows them how to take advantage of the 
power of steam and electricity. 

I advocate industrial education bee use 
in proportion as our people learn to love 
labor, they will hate idlen ss. The curse 
of our large cities is the very large class 
of young men who stand idly on our street 
corners. 

Parents, if you love your boys and girls- 
remember they are not sate until you have 
given them a trade. There is no disgrace 
in any form of service done well, and there 
is eternal disgrace in poor service. 

I advocate our giving attention to utili¬ 
tarian things, because I find a disposition 
on the part of our people in some parts of 
the country to prepare themselve 10 die. I 
don’t know if there is such a tendency 
among the people here. In a city not long 
ago, where I was stopping, I met a gentle¬ 
man at the hotel who said that he was the 
president of a great society, which had 
500 members. I asked the object of his 
society, and he said that its principal ob¬ 
ject was to bury the dead. A few minutes 
later another gentlemen called on me, and 
he said he was the president of a great 
society, numbering about 300 people He 
told me that the main object ot his society 
was to bury the dead. While I was going 
from this city to another, I met a very im¬ 
portant appearing Individual, who carried 
aD armful of books. He talked about or¬ 
ganizing societies—said he had organized 
five in the last county he was in. 
I became interested in his societies, and 
asked what the purposes were. He said 
that their main object was to care for the 
sick and to bury the dead. Now it seems to 
ine that we have too many ot these societies 
and that we ought to stop this burying 
business. No people on earth can live un. 
der such conditions. We are always hear, 
ing of great benefits we are to receive 
after we die. I want some of these good 
things here, I hope you haven’t any of 
these burying societies here, hut if you 
have them don’t break them up, hut change 
the objects. Instead let the purposes be to 
teach the people to put their money in the 
hanks. Let us prepare for life, not death.

Home of Mr. and Mrs. 
Skanks. 

Saturday Evening, January 3rd inst. 
Mr. aud Mrs. J. H. Skanks entertained 
at dinner in honor of Booker T. Wash¬ 
ington at their beautiful home 417 W. 


22nd St The parlors w<»re beautifully

and Mrs. Skanks. Mr. and Mrs. Skanks 
are known for their hospitality, their 
home being one of the most enclusive 
in Southern California. Their enter¬ 
taining is of the refined and cultured 
order with no rudness in their parlors 
and never catering in the least degree 
to the Bohemian. Mr. Washington be¬

ed with the situation and took occasion 
to pay the home and hostes a deserving 
compliment in his address that evening 
at Simpsons Auditoreum.
