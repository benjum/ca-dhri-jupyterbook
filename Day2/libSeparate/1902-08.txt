MISS SUSIE EVA EDMONDS. 


Miss Edmonds, proof reader of The 
Liberator, is the only colored girl in 
The Times scholarship contest. Being 
a working girl she has been unable to 
give to the contest the time it deserves. 
For the generous support she has re¬ 
ceived from friends both white and 
black she is very grateful, especially so 
to the white citizens of South Pasa¬ 
dena, who are so nobly standing by 
her. 


Rev. J, E, Edwards, the popular pas¬ 
tor of the Azusa Street A. M. E. church, 
has also rendered valuable service. He 
stopped another daily paper and paid 
in advance a three months’ subscrip¬ 
tion to The Times for Susie’s benefit. 
He is also doing good work among his 
young people. In fact the colored people 
are beginning to take a lively interest in 
the contest, and the chances to win are 
good. If the colored people of this city 


and vicinity who do not read the Times 
will pay an advanced subscription of 
three to six pionths, she will be a sure 
winner. The Times is a great paper, 
and treats all alike. If the colored peo¬ 
ple will call the attention of their 
white friends to this contest, many of 
them would subscribe for Susie’s bene¬ 
fit.

The Race Question. 


A Strong Letter by “The 
Captain" 


Tillman Scourged. 


The South will have to Deal 
Fair with the Negro. 


Equality of Rights and Op¬ 
portunity the Only 
Solution. 


The article by “The Captain,” on the 
race question, which appeared in the 
“Saturday Post” of JuJy 19th, is by 
far the most candid presentation of the 
facts as they really exist that has come 
under our observation for a long time. 
It is a masterly plea for that fair play 
for which the Declaration of Independ¬ 
ence stands. A plea for that respect 
for the constitution and laws of our 
country without which the American 
governmental fabric must fall and the 
attempt at self-government be brand¬ 
ed as a failure. “The Captain” sees 
and presents Mr. Tillman in his true 
light, as the arch enemy, not only of 
the South, but of the whole country. 
For want of space we can give only a 
few extracts of that powerful arraign¬ 
ment of the South's blind policy of 
repression and retrogression. 

SOUTH CAROLINA A CANCER ON 
THE BODY POLITIC. 

* ***** * 

The great negro race question of this 
country commenced with the forced 
landing of slave cargoes in Virginia 
and North Carolina in Colonial days. 
The people in the Colonies affected 
were even more strongly and violently 
opposed to the introduction of negroes 
than the Pacific Coast has been and is to 
the introduction of the Canton Chinese. 
After the first introduction of negro 
slaves by large land holders and ship¬ 
pers the most unfortunate thing that 
ever happened to the nation was the 
compromise to continue the slave trade 
for eighteen years forced into the con¬ 
stitution by a combination of South 
i on the one side and the New 
t shipping interests on the oth- 
was during those eighteen 
hat the bulk of the negroes 
troduced and it was this trade 
d slave labor in the South. The 
on of slavery had already been 
oed by the civilized world, at 
theory. In fact the Declara- 
Tndependence formally declares 
for freedom and equality before the 
law for all. 

* * * * * * * 


South Carolina stands to the fore in 
the present negro race question, just 
as she did in fixing slavery on the na¬ 
tion, just as she did in forcing seces¬ 
sion. In none of these has South 
Carolina been a good leader for the na¬ 
tion, for the South or for herself. Her 
politicians have always been in a gen¬ 
eral way extremists, arrogant and dic¬ 
tatorial, offensive in their methods and 
blind to the irresistable world tenden¬ 
cies of humanity. Inese politicians 
have often been men of great courage 
and ability, like Calhoun, and often 
mere rough-handed and sharp-tongued 
quarrelers like Brooks, who struck 
Sumner in the senate just as Tillman 
struck his fellow senator, McLaurin, In 
the senate the other day. 

* ***** * 

THE TRUTH OUT. 

His open defense in the senate of 
fraud and shotgun politics in the South 
was one of those impolitic follies with¬ 
out sense or excuse. It was a case 
of indecent exposure. 

* ***** * 

A POLICY OF DESTRUCTION. 
The South Carolina politicians have 
been able to lead the South about by 
the nose, just as they are leading now, 
and they have always led into cul de 
sacs without any outlet. That is what 
they are doing now. The South Caro¬ 
lina politicians have only a hand-to- 
mouth policy to keep the negro from 
the franchise or any responsibility of 
a public kind and by any means what¬ 
ever. There is no future to their pol¬ 
icy. It is against the fundamental prin¬ 
ciples of the republic, just as slavery 
was. The situation under their 
scheme grows worse every day. The 
race antagonism is worse and more 
extreme now than it ever has been 
and grows worse. Rape and lynch 
law accompany political frauds and vi¬ 
olence and the situation is dark and 
dubious, as it was before the civil war. 
THE NORTH DID NOT- WISH TO 
FREE THE NEGROES. 

The free states before the war did 
not intend to interfere with slavery in 
the slave states. The entire body of 
the people were opposed to even rais¬ 
ing the question. Only a. few aboli¬ 
tionists existed in the North and in 
England, but the growing altruism of 
the world was with them. It was the 
South Carolina policy that forced the 
issue to the front. The expansion of 
slavery was their war cry. It was an 
impossible policy for a final outcome. 
Then as an alternative they proposed 
and inaugurated secession and the for¬ 
mation of a slave empire. This was 
equally impossible as a final solution. 
******* 

LOVE NEGRO WOMEN. 

No solution of the race question is 
proposed by the South Carolina lead¬ 
ers. These men can eat food handled 
by negroes, be cooked for, brushed, 
washed or shaved by negroes and even 
have children by negresses—a rather 
intimate personal contact, but cannot 
ride in the same car with a negro or 


he in the same hotel with one—except 

as servant. 

* ***** * 

INSURRECTION AND BLOOD—TILL¬ 
MAN MUST GO. 

The South should cut loose from this 
Tillman cul de sac. There is no health 
in it. If the South does not wish to 
see some outsider come in and settle 
the local race question it must find 
and faithfully follow a practical solu¬ 
tion itself. The present policy has 
no end but surrection and blood. 

SOUNDS THE KEYNOTE. 

The only possible settlement of the 
race question is a fair deal. Liberty 
and law, equality of right and equal¬ 
ity of opportunity must be estab¬ 
lished. To overthrow these can only 
mean at best a temporary gain at ter¬ 
rible cost. The civil war shows what 
the cost can be. We have seen Hayti 
and been in Africa and know some¬ 
thing of the difficulty and danger of a 
fair deal to the negro. Yet there 
can he no other solution that will 
stand. 

GETTING THEIR EYES OPEN. 

The savage is being brought out in 
the white as well as in the negro. Re¬ 
cent lynchings, both North and South, 
of negroes, show what the policy of 
South Carolina is doing for breeding 
hatred between the races. Politicians 
made the civil war over nothing. Blind 
politicians they were. So they are 
now blind as Sampson, but like him 
they pull the building of the state 
down, and not on his enemies, as 
Sampson did, but on their friends. 

Politicians after the civil war, also 
blind, started the race question 
wrong. Is there any hope for a per 
manent caste in a free country? There 
is no hope in it. 


It has been our contention all along 
that the toleration lawlessness in the 
South toward the negroes would lead 
to a spread of lawlessness over the 
whole country. The wholesale lynch¬ 
ing of negroes in the South and the 
frequent burning of them at the stake 
on suspicion of crime has brought dis¬ 
grace. upon the entire country and 
threatens civilization itself. What a 
spectacle, this nation with mobs and 
burnings at the stake presents to the 
civilized world. With power to stand 
against the world, it cowers before a 
lawles minority within its borders. 
Like a huge prize fighter, while stand- 
in the ring with all competitors at bay, 
is slowly dying, the victims of an ap¬ 
petite which he has not the moral coub 
age to resist, yet he must know that 
that it is resistance or death. The 
compromise with slavery during the 
life of Thomas Jefferson simply re¬ 
sulted in compromise after compromise 
each more degrading to the country 
until the nation was plunged into a 
bloody war. Those, who have stud¬ 
ied the race question have witnessed 
the same compromising spirit on the 
part of the northern people that char¬ 
acterized them before the rebellion.

The South’s demand to be left alone 
to settle the race question in their own 
way—a way they claimed would be 
just and fair to both races, was 
granted. The South next gave the 
country to understand that the 
only way the two races could dwell 
together amicably was the disfran¬ 
chisement of the negroes, or, in other 
words, although the South was pe.i. 
fectly friendly toward the negro, the 
only way to maintain that friendship 
was to chain the negro hand and foot. 
And, strange enough, the country 
thought it the best way to give the 
negro a chance. This gave the negro 
a chance—a chance to be lynched, to 
be burned at the stake on suspicion, 
made him the victim of the lawless 
element of the entire country, .made 
h‘m the scapegoat of the vicious whites 
of both sexes. 

When the South, with the consent of 
the country, went into the scheme of 
nullification it committed itself to a 
policy of lawlessness with the result 
that after 27 years of white supremacy 
in the South we have a condition of 
lawlessness in that section that is un¬ 
parallelled in history. The fact,how¬ 
ever, must not be lost sight of that 
the addition to the already large illit¬ 
erate voting population of the South 
by the enfranchisement of the negroes 
augmented it out of all proportions, 
and confronted that section with a se¬ 
rious problem—one requiring states¬ 
manship, honesty and forbearance. The 
South made the mistake of trying to 
rectify a supposed wrong by doing 
wrong; to encourage respect for law 
by setting it aside; punish murder by 
murder.

THE RIVER OF YOUTH. 

Sweet, limpid stream of thee I dream; 

Within the shady dell; 

Through ever-glade and cedar’s shade 
Thy waters seethe and swell. 

i 

Tby song so sweet my senses greet, 

As onward thou dost flow; 

In joy and glee, so wild and free— 
Where fragrant breezes blow. 
Through green, wild woods and soli¬ 
tudes 

Is heard thy melody; 

Through summer bloom and winter’s 
gloom, 

My soul is linked to thee. 

Like summer dreams and rainbow 
gleams, 

So full of ecstacy; 

Flow on serene through meadows 
green, 

Into the deep, blue sea. 

Thy anthem swells in sad farewells 
To joys forever gone; 

Sweet, limpid stream of childhood’s 
dream. 

Passed to oblivion.

MR. C. C. FLINT. 

“In view of what Gov. Gage has done 
for the negroes, they owe him an un¬ 
qualified indorsement. To do other¬ 
wise is suicidal.”—C. C. Flint. Mr. 
Flint is a representative man and suc¬ 
cessful grocer.

THE AFRO-AMERICAN LEAGUE 
VERY LOW. 


The condition of the Afro-American 
League is precarious. Bad health and 
lack of funds is said to be the trouble. 
A meeting called the other night to ap¬ 
point a finance committee was slimly 
attended, made up mainly of the old 
push. The call for the meeting, was 
read from every colored pulpit in the 
city, and headed “A meeting of the 
Afro-Americans;” the addition of “s” 
and leaving of the word “League” out 
caught only a few suckers and they 
left in a hurry. It seems the league 
is up against a hard proposition; the 
Morton wing of the congress will .meet 
at Bakersfield some time in September. 
How to get to Bakersfield on wind 
without wings is the nut they are try¬ 
ing to crack. 

After player for divine aid, which 
will certainly be needed, a call for 
a collection to pay for the lights re¬ 
vealed the fact that every mother's son 
of them was “non-financed.” There is 
a few disgruntal's, headed by the Eagle 
man, opposed to the endorsement of 
Governor Gage. They feel that they 
got left in swig scrap. Mr. G. M. 
Warner favors the Governor’s endorse¬ 
ment for the recognition he has given 
the negroes. To make the congress a 
success, there is a movement on foot 
to bring it to Garvanza; this would se¬ 
cure a full house, as the fare is only 
5 cents and the more economical could 
take Adam’s line—take it a-foot. 


THE W r ESLEY CHAPEL BENEVO¬ 
LENT ASSOCIATION. 

At the annual election of the above 
association, Mr. A. S. Eagle was re¬ 
elected president almost unanimously; 
Mrs. Harriet Owens, vice-president; 
Miss Lucille Brown, secretary; S. Ol¬ 
iver, assistant secretary; Mr. Henry 
Busby, treasurer; Horris Busby, chap¬ 
lain; Mr. A. Fleming, marshal. The 
annual sermon will be preached Au¬ 
gust 10th. The society is in a prosper¬ 
ous condition and the utmost harmony 
prevails. This society has rendered 
valuable service to its members, its 
business being conducted on business 
principles. The personnel of its of¬ 
ficers recently elected guarantees con¬ 
tinued pr osperity. _ 

A GRAND RECEPTION: The recep¬ 
tion tendered Rev. Donohoo, late dele¬ 
gate to the International Sunday 
school convention at Denver, was a 
brilliant affair and reflected . much 
credit to the Woman’s Home Mission¬ 
ary society all concerned. The audi¬ 
ence, made up of representative citi¬ 
zens, was a large and appreciative one. 

The introductory paper read by Mrs. 
Betty Montgomery, on behalf of the 
woman’s home missionary society, 
deserves much credit, and was one of 
the main features of the evening. Mrs. 
Montgomery must try again. 

The prelude played by Miss Jetty 
Clark, was worthy of the occasion, and 
was greeted with a hearty encore. Miss 
Clark was at her best and played her 
oqAi *i£qsng nmossiH ssrH *TT3A\ hind 
presided so gracefully at the piano is 
deserving of special mention. The 
manner in which she handled the keys 
nf the instrument was simrdv remarka¬ 
ble, *nd the taud'en p e lost, itself in the 
melody that came forth at her bidding. 
Mr. W. F. Henderson, whose rich 
voice has been a source of attraction 
to Wesley Chapel for the lovers of 
good singing, scored another triumph. 
The audience was simply swept from 
its feet and borne aloft on wave after 
wave of melodious ecstacy. 

On the whole the speakers of the 
evening, Messrs. Edwards, Hubbard 
and Donohoo, acquitted themselves 
well and the audience showed its ap¬ 
preciation by close attention and be¬ 
coming demeanor. Rev. Donohoo's re¬ 
port was full and interesting and his 
welcome was very cordial. Rev. Ed¬ 
wards paid special attention to the 
influence of leaders upon the mases. 
His remarks made a deep impression. 
Rev. Hubbard brought greeting from 
Pasadena. After a vocal solo by W. 
F. Henderson refreshment were served. 

Rev. Woodbey, the colored socialist 
orator, who has been delivering a se¬ 
ries of lectures in this city, on social¬ 
ism, is an orator of rare powers and 
has been listened to by larger colored 
gatherings that was ever listened to by 
any anti-republican speaker. This,of 
itself, is a splendid sign and proves 
that colored men are doing some think¬ 
ing in their own name. Rev. Woodbey 
is eloquent, logical and persuasive.

THE CAPTAIN. 

Elsewhere in these colujnns we pub¬ 
lish extracts from an able article on 
the race problem by “The Captain/ 7 
published in the Saturday Post of July 
19th. It is by far the most candid 
broad, honest presentation of the facts 
in this vexed problem we have read 
yet. No one can read it without be¬ 
coming convinced that the real prob¬ 
lem before the American people today 
is not the negro problem, but the white 
man’s problem. Whether the white 
man will obey his own self-made laws 
or not. It is with the white men to 
say whether this is a land of Chris¬ 
tians or hypocrites; whether this is 
the land of the free and the home of 
the brave or a land of cowardly, cold¬ 
blooded murders and negro burners. 

It is extremely gratifying to know 
that able, conscientious white men, 
like “The Captain”—men who are not 
afraid to speak out in the interest of 
justice and fair play are beginning to 
take a hand in this matter looking to 
an honorable settlement. The best 
friends of the South today are the 
men of the Captain's stripe. “The 
Liberator,” like “The Captain,” is op¬ 
posed to the South's policy of murder 
and nullification not because we are 
enemies of that section, but because 
we know it to be a destructive policy; 
one that must lead to ruin, not only 
the South, but the whole country. We 
do not believe in compromising with a 
wrong because the people want it, or 
because it is popular.

NO FIGHT ON HAMBURGER: 
While this journal has no fight on 
Hamburger, it is our plain duty to im¬ 
press upon its colored readers and sup¬ 
porters the fact that Hamburger does 
not want their trade. He flatly re¬ 
fuses to advertise in colored papers or 
in any way patronize them, while the 
great Broadway Department Store, the 
largest establishment of the kind in 
Southern California, is liberal in its 
patronage of colored pape^ and col¬ 
ored enterprises. Hamburger patron¬ 
izes nothing owned or controlled by ne¬ 
groes. Have you ever seen his adver¬ 
tisement in a colored paper? No, no, 
no! He wants nothing to do with a ne¬ 
gro, and the intelligent, self-respecting 
negro will have nothing to do with 
him. The man or firm that will dis¬ 
criminate against you in giving out his 
work, will discriminate against In 
dealings whenever possible. The Broad¬ 
way Department Store treats both 
races alike in letting out its advertise¬ 
ment. The large increase in the col¬ 
ored trade at that store shows that 
they have their eyes open. If we will 
make it a rule to patronize only those 


who encourage our enterprises, the 
color line in business will be 
broken down and hundreds of 
places will be opened to the boys and' 
girls we are educating. LET ALL 
COLORED PERSONS STAY AWAY 
FROM HAMBURGER’S TILL HE 
WANTS THEIR TRADE.

THE FLINT COLORED TROOPS 
BEATEN. 

The attempt of the Flint colored 
troops to pass a resolution indorsing 
him for governor in the B. K. Bruce 
Marching club was ignominiously de¬ 
feated Tuesday night. The anti-Flint 
forces under the leadersnip of Colonel 
Geo. M. Warner, who is a stalwart Gage 
man, won a signal victory. The Flint 
cohorts, like three frogs in a mud hole, 
made a d—1 of a lot of noise, but noise 
aint votes. The boys died hard, but 
died. The colored voters are for the 
endorsement of Gov. Gage. 

-Q.- 

WOULDN’T RAISE THE COLORED 
MEN’S WAGES. 


A few days ago the board of super¬ 
visors raised the wages of all em¬ 
ployes at the court house but the ne¬ 
groes; they were left out in the cold. 
The men who earn fat salaries mainly 
by wearing out the seats of their 
pants, had their pay increased, but ne¬ 
gro janitors who do all of the hard 
work cleaning up the filth and dust be¬ 
ing compelled to work twelve hours 
every other day were overlooked in 
the salary grab. If honest Jim Han¬ 
ley, the democrat, had been there, he 
would have made a howl. But the 
board is republican now. Lord save 
us from our friends. 

THE PASSING OF DISTINGUISHED 
CITIZENS. 

The deaths of Gen. W. H. L. Barnes 
and Millionaire John W. Mackay marks 
the passing of two citizens whose lives 
and characters made a deep impression 
upon their fellow citizens. At one fell 
stroke California loses a great lawyer 
and a remarkable financier. 

-o- 

MAJ. J. A. DONNELL—The an¬ 
nouncement of Maj. Donnell’s candi¬ 
dacy for the office of district attorney 
puts a new face on the present contest 
and practically puts tne other candi¬ 
dates out of the race. The major filled 
the office several years ago, and gave 
the people a safe, economical adminis¬ 
tration. So popular is he with the 
voters that his nomination is almost 
certain. 

-—-o- 

Mr. J. H. Trout, candidate for Coro¬ 
ner, is a sucessful druggist and is in 
every way well fitted for the position. 
Should he receive the republican nom¬ 
ination his election is almost certain. 
He is well known and popular, with the 
colored voters, not because he is a re- * 
publican, but on account of his straight 
forward manliness. In the convention 
he will have the solid colored vote. 



F. R. WILLIS, 

FOR STATE SENATOR, 36TH DIST, 

The News takes pleasure in present- 
ing to its readers this week the formal 
announcement of F. R. Willis of Los 
Angeles as a candidate for Senator 
from the 36th Senatorial district. Mr. 
Willis has resided in this ward for the 
last sixteen years, and during that time 
his official ancf private conduct has 
been such as to gain for hi,m the per¬ 
sonal esteem of all with whom he has 
become acquainted throughout this sen¬ 
atorial district. For years that portion 
of the city embraced within this dis¬ 
trict has cheerfully supported the nom¬ 
inee for State Senator, although the 
honor of naming a candidate has not 
been accorded to the city. Other things 
being equal we feel that we can now 
consistently ask that this nomination 
go to the city, and that the other por¬ 
tions of the district furnish the same 
support that we have done in years 
gone by. 

* * * * 

We need men who are obliging and 
courteous, men of undoubted integrity 
and personal worth, in order to com¬ 
mand the respect and influence neces¬ 
sary to properly represent us. All of 
these qualifications are possessed by 
our candidate, and we present his name 
with full confidence that he will re¬ 
ceive the support of the best element of 
his party.—Los Angeles News. 

Mr. Willis will have the support of 
the colored delegates in the convention, 
as his business relations with the col¬ 
ored citizens has made him many 
friends among them.

Trying to Prevent the 
Colored Voters from 
Endorsing Gov. Gage. 

The Political Highwayman 
Abroad. 


Gage will be Endorsed. 


The Old Gang Shown Up. 

The attempt of a few ballot mongers, 
nuclei* the leadership of J. J. Neimore, 
to sell the B. K. Bruce Marching club 
to the highest bidder, either by the 
endorsement of the candidacy of Sen¬ 
ator Flint or the withholding of the 
merited endorsement from Governor 
Gage, will fail of its purpose. Ninety- 
nine one-hundredths of the colored vot¬ 
ers favor the endorsement of the gov¬ 
ernor for the recognition he has given 
the race and he will have their un¬ 
qualified endorsement and should have 
it at once. The attitude in which 
Neimore and his gang is trying to 
place the race is one of the most dis¬ 
graceful ever conceived. How on 
earth can the negroes hope to com¬ 
mand the respect of the Flint support¬ 
ers or any one else, if they go hack 
upon Governor Gage, after all that he 
has done for them? The fight upon the 
Governor is not one of public policy, 
but of private pique. It is admitted 
by all who have no axe to grind that 
his administration has been strong and 
economical. In the present personal 
fight upon hi,m by certain newspapers 
in this state the negro has neither 
part nor lot. While the great body 
of white voters are lining up for Gov¬ 
ernor Gage, there is an attempt by a 
handful of political highwaymen to 
hold aloof the negroes, who have ev¬ 
erything, manhood, self-respect and 
honor at stake, in order that these po¬ 
litical vultures may devour the charac¬ 
ter and good name of the race. 

Shall it be done? Shall the virtue, in¬ 
telligence and good name of the ne¬ 
groes of Southern California be surren¬ 
dered to these shameless political job¬ 
bers. to be sold for a price? 

NO FRIEND TO THE NEGROES: 
Are the men who are conducting the 
Flint campaign in this city friendly to¬ 
ward the negro? Let uc see. Who are 
they? Senator Bulla, Boss Thomas 
Hughes and his two principal wards, 
Recorder Caldwell and Assessor Wade. 
What has Senator Bulla ever done for 
the negro? He gave one a job to clean 
spittoons in the senate at ‘Sacramento 
and displayed considerable carelessness 
in making his selection. But “Boss” 
Hughes, Caldwell and Wade, what 
have they done for the negro? How 



many negroes have Caldwell and Wade 
given employment in their offices dur¬ 
ing the past four years? Although 
Caldwell and Wade emp'oy each 20 
regular clerks and twice that many at 
the busy seasons of the year, they 
have never given the negroes a single 
day’s work. This, too, in the face of 
the fact that they had the support of 
fully 75 per cent of the colored votes. 
Ex-Assessor Theodore Summerland 
made it a rule when he was assessor 
to employ two or three colored clerks 
during the busy seasons, but these 
Flint gentlemen have made it a point 
to keep out all negroes except the spit¬ 
toon cleaners, over whom they have 
no jurisdiction. 

Who knows but what this fight upon 
the Governor is not partly due to his 
manly recognition of the black Repub¬ 
licans—a thing that was never done be¬ 
fore in this State. But what does the 
Neimore gang care for this? Neimore is 
the “Race” and the “Race” wants 
money and wants it bad. The Flint 
sack will not be “sacked” until the 
colored clubs are delivered and this 
must be done before the county con¬ 
vention or the sack will go “unsacked.” 
HE IS UNGRATEFUL. 

When the legislature assembled in 
January, 1901, this man Neimore was 
in this city completely stranded, an 
object of pity. When Speaker Pen¬ 
dleton, who is a friend of the Gov¬ 
ernor, heard of it, he personally sought 
the aid of Hon. W. S. M^lick, to se¬ 
cure him, (Neimore) a job of clean¬ 
ing spittoons at Sacramento, as that 
was all he was qualified to do. This 
is the gratitude he is showing his and 
the Governor’s friends. It is base. Can 
the respectable negroes of this c ; ty for 
a moment follow such a counterfeit of 
a man? 

THE B. K. BRUCE MARCHING CLUB 
TO BE AUCTIONED OFF. 

The movement to make Rev. S. W. 
Hawkins’ church or the nest in rear of 
the headquarters of this club, composed 
largely of honorable men, is conclu¬ 
sive proof that it is to be sold. This 
same hall, cor. 4th and Ruth ave., was 
the scene of the recent plundering of 
the Wesley Chapel Benevolent society 
by which the hard earnings of the poor 
old washerwomen and hard working 
old men were shamelessly and unlaw¬ 
fully squandered, and they were given 
to understand that they could leave it 
d ? spleased with the manner in which 
they had been swindled. This same 
den is to be the bargain counter over 
which this splendid organization is to 
be sold. 

The Afro-American Leaeue. which 
now consists of Neimore, G W. Haw¬ 
kins, the chronic windbag, Jas. Alex¬ 
ander, the good man gone wrong, 
Rev. S. W. Hawkins of the “dingy 
robe” fame, W. H. Shores, presi¬ 
dent of the Benevolent society, 
that created such a panic among the 
washerwomen a few days ago and who 
are still minus of their money and 
other members -of the old “finance 


committee” are quartered there. The 
attempt to make Mr. George M. War¬ 
ner president of the League so as to 
increase its selling price failed. War¬ 
ner wouldn’t be used. 

The latest scheme now is to round 
up the club and sell Warner, Loving, 
Njris, Burdette and the whole thing. 

Will these gentlemen and other de¬ 
cent members of the club allow them¬ 
selves to be auctioned off like so 
many cattle? We have no sympathy 
for those who have put themselves in 
the hands of this gang to be sold, buc 
we draw the line there. If Senator 
Flint wants to be stood up and relieved 
of his cash it is none of our business, 
but it shall not be done in the name 
:f the colored citizens, if we can help 
it. Only the other day a Flint man¬ 
ager expressed himself as being afraid 
to trust the negro. Unless the self- 
respecting negroes call a halt, the sen¬ 
timent expressed by the Flint man will 
be the prevailing sentiment. If Che 
negroes go back on Governor Gage not 
a Flint man in the state would or could 
trust them.

SUPT. J. H. STRINE. 


Prof. J. H. Strine, county superin 
tendent of schools, is a candidate be¬ 
fore the republican convention for re¬ 
nomination for bis present position. So 
well has he performed his duties that 
there will be no seri-ous opposition to 
his renomination and election. The 
position of superintendent of education 
is one of such personal interest to each 
voter that it should be stripped of all 
partisan significance, making the best 
interest of the schools the only issue.

Dr. M. E. Sykes is building a fine 
residence on Ohio street. He is also 
building a number of flats.

Miss Holden’s entertainment was a 
success, the participants playing well 
their parts. Miss Holden deserves 
much credit for its production. Finan¬ 
cially it was satisfactory. Consider¬ 
able less was entailed by the failure 
of some of the ministers to turn in un¬ 
sold tickets for reserved seats, all of 
which could have been sold if they had 
been turned in. 

-o-- 

There are so many so-called intelli¬ 
gent negroes who pretend to be help¬ 
ing the race by selling the race wind 
for money. These leaders have noth¬ 
ing to give. 


The negro is sorely afflicted with 
leaders who take no interest in him un¬ 
less the self-constituted leader is to be 
personally benefited. This class of lead¬ 
ers should be pulled down, whether in 
politics or elsewhere.

No. 31, Susie Edmonds, of South Pas¬ 
adena, is the only representative of her 
race in the scholarship contest. She is 
the daughter of the editor of the Lib¬ 
erator, a newspaper published in the 
c ty in the interest of the Afro-Amer¬ 
ican population. Miss Susie attends 
to all of her father's correspondence 
and reads the proof of his paper, and 
she does her work well. A white lady 
writing from Long Beach, says in be¬ 
half of this girl: 

“Inclosed are two subscriptions to 
The Times which I wish to have 
placed to the credit of Susie Edmonds 
of South Pasadena. I am sending in all 
the coupons I can for her, 'and I think 
she is deserving of assistance. I know 
her family and their circumstances 
only casually, from having lived in- 
their locality, and I am a stranger In 
this part of the state. If the people 
of her own race will only do all they 
can for her as their representative, I 
sure she cannot fail to win a 
scholarship. That she has made as 
good showing as she has is to her 
credit. Believing that in education lies 
the solution of the race problem in the 
United States, I shall continue to do 
what r can in her behalf, though I am 
not of her color, and she knows noth¬ 
ing about what I -am doing.”—The
