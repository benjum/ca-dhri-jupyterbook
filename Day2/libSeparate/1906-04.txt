LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALLENS 
WORTH. 

A splendid audience of representa¬ 
tive colored people filled the main 
auditorium of Wesley Chapel M. E. 
church on the ninth of April to a re¬ 
ception and banquet tendered Lieuten¬ 
ant Colonel Allensworth by the South¬ 
ern California Real Estate and Invest¬ 
ment Company, in honor of his retire¬ 
ment from the regular United States 
Army and promotion from Major to 
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 

Mr. C. C. Flint, president of the 
real estate company presided, and up¬ 
on the opening of the reception he 
congratulated his company for the 
good fortune of having Colonel Allens¬ 
worth for its business manager, and 
the colored people of the city for hav¬ 
ing in their midst the only colored man 
who had ever been placed on the re¬ 
tired list with a rank as high as Lieu¬ 
tenant Colonel. 

The most effective of the many 
speeches that were made, with the ex¬ 
ception of Colonel Allensworth’s, were 
those of Lieutenant Williams, Captain 
Crumbly and Rev. Pack. 

Lieutenant Williams informed the 
audience of the many hardships to 
which a colored soldier was exposed, 
and of the courage and manliness one 
must possess in order to succeed as 
had Colonel Allensworth. On the race 
question as it affected the army like 
his old neighbors of Atlanta DuDois, 
Bowen and J. Max Barber, he was 
strong and uncompromising. 

Captain Crumbly spoke of the ca¬ 
reers of several colored soldiers who, 
through the want of riper experience 
had failed. 

Rev. Peck was proud of our present 
leaders, and could not see why the 
race should not succeed. 

Colonel Allensworth was given a 
great ovation as he came forward to 
respond to the speeches; the response 
was in the nature of a reminiscence 
of his life in the army. For a half 
hour or more he kept the audience 
laughing continually at the way he 
kept the erring colored soldiers out of 
trouble, and how he overcame the 
foolish, prejudice the white soldiers 
entertained for colored officers. 

By that time the audience had be¬ 
come fully conscious of the importance 
of the occasion, and through the sug¬ 
gestion of the president they went for¬ 
ward at the end of the speaking and 
congratulated the gray-haired victor 
and acknowledged their appreciation 
of the good name he had made for 
them. The evening was pleasantly 
and successfully closed by a banquet 
in the basement of the church.

Good News for Vardaman 

DYING OUT. 

The Negro-haters of the country 
should be happy. Dr. Seale Harris, 
professor of medicine in the Univer¬ 
sity of Alabama ( waited on President 
Roosevelt at the White House last 
Monday and declared to him that the 
Negro race in this country was likely 
to become extinct through the rav¬ 
ages of disease. This should be grat¬ 
ifying information to all classes, who 
have been vainly endeavoring to bring 
about the results predicted. The 
lynchers and the white-cappers can 
certainly suspend operations for a 
while and await results. 

We do not know whether Dr. Har¬ 
ris refers specifically to black Ne¬ 
groes or to white ones, or to both, but 
he is certain that he is correct in his 
conclusions. This should be joyous 
information, too, to Bishop Henry M. 
Turner and his followers, who have 
been attempting to reduce the num¬ 
ber of Negroes in this country to the 
proverbial zero, by means of emigra¬ 
tion to Africa. They, too, can sus¬ 
pend their agitation and await the 
triumph of disease. 

As a preliminary method of aiding 
in this movement to eliminate the Ne¬ 
gro in this country as a living factor, 
we would suggest the hanging of all 
white men who are guilty of criminal 
conduct with the females of the Negro 
race. This would prevent to an extent 
at least the increase in the number 
of white Negroes. Some of these are 
so white that, barring their own word 
for it, there is no way of telling them 
from the genuine Caucasian article. 
Even the giant, Disease, will be baf¬ 
fled in its choosing of victims, not 
daring to attack a white Negro for 
fear of making a mistake and carry¬ 
ing off a genuine white person in¬ 
stead. 

As the average Negro has more re¬ 
ligion than anything else, and is ac¬ 
cordingly a sure candidate for Heaven 
and all of its immortal glories, we 
are of the opinion that Dr. Harris is 
certainly bringing good news to them. 
Just to think that we shall not dis¬ 
appear from this country by means ot 
amalgamation, but by the route of dis¬ 
ease. 


Why, this is enough to drive Rev. 
Thomas Dixon’s Clansman from the 
stage and give the Negroes of the 
country a rest from persecution for 
at least twenty years. There is one 
factor that we had lost sight of, how¬ 
ever, and which gives us no little 
concern. We refer to the employing 
elements of the South-land. Tobacco 
raisers, cotton and sugar cane grow¬ 
ers and the raisers of 'cattle and the 
producers of hay, corn, oats, wheat 
and barley. They have been claim¬ 
ing that the baby Negroes have not 
been coming fast enough, and when 
white men jumped in and helped to 
accelerate the commotion in this di¬ 
rection, they have said nothing. 

They want more Negroes, not less 
Negroes, and to them the prophecy 
of this meddling doctor will partake 
the nature of a funeral dirge. So far 
as the race is concerned, it has learn¬ 
ed to be smiling in the face of ad¬ 
versity and happy in the presence of 
good news. Dr. Harris may worry 
President Roosevelt and the moneyed 
men of the South-land, but “Sambo in 
Dixie” sees many bright things ahead 
and the prophecies of the Scriptures 
are ever uppermost in his mind. 

Even today, while the predictions 
of evil as to his future are being made, 
he is singing in the cornfield and in 
the cabin, in the kitchen and in the 
parlor: 

“In the sweetfields of Eden, where 
the tree of life is blooming. 
There’ll be rest for the weary; there’ll 
be rest for my soul.” 

—Richmond (Va.) Planet. 


AFRO-AMERICANS SHOULD TAKE 
NOPART IN THE JAMESTOWN 


Crow department would doubtless 
give some member of the race a 
chance to earn a little blood money at 
the expense of manhood. But the 
man who would sacrifice manhood 
rights for money or cheap notoriety is 
on the same plane witn the wretch 
who would barter female chastity for 
the same thing. Wait till the South 
recognizes the Afro-American as a 
man. Be in no hurry, wait till hell 
claims it own—the Vardmans, Till¬ 
mans, the Heflens and Jeff Davis’s of 
Ark. While Afro-Americans should 
aid the South in every laudable en¬ 
deavor, they should lend her no aid 
whatever in her unholy efforts to 
dwarf men’s souls. 


THE SAN FRANCISCO HORROR. 

The annihilation of San Francisco 
by fire, following an earthquake, re¬ 
cords one of the most appalling disas¬ 
ters ever witnessed in North Amer¬ 
ica. Giant steel buildings, with their 
massive foundations set deep in the 
earth, went down before the elements 
like toadstools. In 1898 we had the 
pleasure of visiting the Call, Exam¬ 
iner and Parrot buildings, and as we 
looked upon those giants- of architect¬ 
ural skill, we thought that they would 
challenge the admiration of inquiring 
multitudes long after the men of this 
day and generation had passed into 
oblivion. But, as with our mind’s eye 
we see the blackened ruins of San 
Francisco’s business center, which but 
yesterday was a veritable beehive of 
commercial strife, and her massive 
steel office buildings which bade fair 
to greet the rising sun for centuries 
to come, now silent heaps of steel, 
brick and stone, we are forcibly re¬ 
minded of the unstableness of the 
handiwork of man. Men erect states 
and build civilizations, only to see 
them die on reaching their meridian. 


EXPOSITION, 

In view of the fact that Jim Crowism 
is growing in this country and has a 
stronger hold in the South than relig¬ 
ion of Christ, Afro-Americans can not 
with self-respect take part in exposi¬ 
tions given in that section. When the 
Jim Crow cars and class legislation 
are abolished in the South, it 
will be time enough for Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans to put in money to ad¬ 
vertise it. Of course a Jim 


NEARLY $500 RAISED. 

At a mass meeting held by the Afro- 
Americans of the city at Wesley M. 
E. Church, nearly ?500 was raised for 
the San Francisco sufferers. This is 
in-deed commendable. San Francisco’s 
charity for the unfortunate has been 
world-wide and now sympathy for her 
in her great calamity is world-wide. 

Our brethren from the stricken will 
find our doors open and a cordial wel¬ 
come.

ings to the merciless flames. In San 
Francisco thousands of tear-wet faces 
witnessed the incineration of human 
bodies, because they were powerless 
to rescue them. 

At Springfield, Mo., 5(L0 merry-mak¬ 
ing white men, women and children 
witnessed the slaughter and incinera¬ 
tion of three Afro-Americans because 
they were black. The Springfield hor¬ 
ror was a display of the white man’s 
growing contempt for the laws of 
Heaven and earth—his growing dis¬ 
regard for the God-given rights of his 
fellow-man of darker hue. The one 
following it was the result of an act of 
nature. Before both the civilized 
world stands appalled. The latter, 
men cannot prevent. The former is a 
manifestation of the American white 
man’s freedom under the flag. 


white person can read it without hav¬ 
ing his or her respect for the down¬ 
trodden Afro-American increased. 
While it loves all of God’s creatures, 
it is an uncompromising foe of all race- 
haters and trouble breeders.

THE GENEROSITY OF THE AMERI¬ 
CAN PEOPLE UNBOUNDED. 

The response of the American peo¬ 
ple to the relief of our stricken sister 
city San Francisco, is as vigorous and 
forthcoming as the awful catastrophe 
was appalling. From nearly every 
section thousands are coming to swell 
the relief fund.

TWIN HORRORS. 

April, 1906, wMl be memorable for 
two horrors the contemplation of 
which makes the hearts of civilized 
men sick. One was enacted at Spring- 
field, Mo., when on Saturday Dight 
preceding Easter a mob of white men 
took three innocent untried Afro- 
Americans from jail and hanged them 
on the arm of the Statue of Liberty 
and burned their bodies to ashes in 
the presence of 5000 white men, wo¬ 
men and children. 

The other took place at San Fran¬ 
cisco on the 18th, when an earthquake 
shook down the business center of 
that great city, and as if to give a 
free hand to the subsequent confla¬ 
gration, wrenched in twain the water 
mains, leaving the doomed city and 
scores of living imprisoned human be* 


THE SLAUGHTER IN SAN FRAN¬ 
CISCO. 

The wholesale cold-blooded slaugh¬ 
ter of unarmed citizens by the soldiers 
and blood-thirsty irresponsible petty 
officers in San Francisco, unless 
checked, will be more appalling than 
the earthquake and conflagration. 

The wholesale lynching of Afro- 
Americans in this country has made 
life so cheap and the thirst for blood 
so oppressive that the average white 
man can not let slip an opportunity 
that comes his way to shed innocent 
blood, even if it be a white man’s 
blood. The mania for killing among 
the white people has become so ram¬ 
pant that they spare neither their wo¬ 
men or children. Unless there is a 
change, what a mess they will make 
of this country.

BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. 

The Binghampton (N. Y.) Republi¬ 
can says: 

In Texas the Negroes have pur¬ 
chased two hundred and sixty acres of 
land, and started a seclusive colony. 
No one but a Negro will be permitted 
to buy land there or build a house. 
That is all right as far as it goes, but 
it does not go far enough. In Texas 
wild land can probably be purchased 
for twenty-five cents to a dollar an 
acre. 

If the Negroes segregate and go in 
large numbers, there will be no such 
thing as going away back. Wherever 
there is a crowd is the center of the 
world, and the sun will revolve around 
it just as it goes around New York 
City. 

The Negroes in the South have ac¬ 
quired possession and ownership of 
much wealth. Instead of buying a 
small tract in Texas they can pur¬ 
chase a county. Then their segrega¬ 
tion will amount to something. And 
they can show the world what a Negro 
colony can do.—The Moon.

To a land of summer bloom. 

Its battle-flag floats on the breeze, 
Inscribed with many victories. 

Long may its stainless banner wave 
In triumph o’er oppression’s grave.

SENATOR HAHN IS POPULAR 
WITH HIS COLORED 

NEIGHBORS. 

, State Senator B. W. Hahn, who is 
candidate to succeed himself, has the 
enthusiastic support of the great body 
of his colored neighbors in Pasadena. 
If he holds his own with his white 
neighbors as well as he does with his 
dark ones, his re-nomination aud elec¬ 
tion is as certain as a thing can be. 
He comes of a family whose friendship 
for the Afro-Americans, has always 
been spontaneous and helpful, his 
father being loved by them as was the 
late lamented Doctor Ried. Discuss¬ 
ing the matter prominent colored 
men say that Senator Hahn, like his 
father, has always been identified with 
those most friendly to the race, he 
having placed in nomination United 
States Senator Flint, Gov. Pardee and 
the late Hon. W. S. Mellick, all friends 
of the race. 

It is further argued that, as Senator 
Mr. Hahn has given satisfaction to his 
constituents and rendered the state 
honorable service, his opponents who 
are all honorable gentlemen are sim¬ 
ply aspirants for the honor and pres¬ 
tige the position carries. Mr. Hahn is 
a young man with an honorable record 
and the unwritten law of a second 
term as an endorsement will hardly 
be broken in his. It looks as if the 
other candidates will have to wait. 


All Afro-Americans and every white 
person who is tired of mob rule must 
buy and prepare to use Winchester 
Rifles. 

Now that the President has decided 
not to punish the Chattanooga, Tenn., 
lynchers who set at defiance the na¬ 
tional authority by lynching Ed. John¬ 
son, colored, after the U. S. Supreme 
Court had granted a stay of proceed¬ 
ings, leaves all Afro-Americans at the 
mercy of mobs. 

The punishing mobs for murdering 
Afro-Americans is to be left to the 
states, this of course means 4hat- they 
are to be left without redresses here¬ 
tofore. It is worse than useless to 
look to officers of the law for protec¬ 
tion for they are usually a part of the 
mob, or are in sympathy with.it. The 
present plan is to call out the militia 
after the mob gets through with its 
butchery and other outrages. The 
governor denounces the mob, offers re¬ 
wards and now and then a few mem¬ 
bers of mob are indicted only to be 
discharged by juries chosen from the 
mob and the farce is ended, the mob 
endorsed and its victims declared to 
be innocent. For the Afro-Americans 
and good white people, and there are 
lots of them who are believers in the 
supremacy of the law, there is but one 
alternative, and that is to arm them¬ 
selves and holh mobs in check till the 
militia comes. 

If the good white people are afraid 
to stand for law and order, then Afro- 
Americans must display that same 
manly and unflinching courage that 
rescued the now silent Roosevelt from 
the jaws of death in' Cuba and chal¬ 


lenged the admiration of the world by 
their dash up San Juan hill. To break 
the shackles of their limbs and pre¬ 
vent the destruction of the greatest 
republic the world ever saw, 200,000 
black men went to the front in the 
sixties, sacrificing thousands of lives 
on the altar of liberty. Before mobs 
are suppressed in this country history 
will repeat itself. Are the Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans who pour out their life-blood like 
water for the protection of others too 
cowardly to pour it out to protect 
thejr wives, daughters and homes from 
lawless mobs, simply because their 
skins are white with hearts blacker 
than hell. 

How many more savage scenes like 
those enacted at Springfield, Ohio, and 
Springfield, Mo? 

How long oh Lord is this Christian 
nation to be held up to the scorn and 
ridicule of Christendom by this contin¬ 
ued display of low savagery? 

In every national crisis since the 
founding of this republic the Afro- 
American has gone to its rescue and 
its redemption from cowardly mobs 
and class legislation is lo be no excep¬ 
tion. One hundred Afro-Americans 
armed with Winchester rifles and a de¬ 
termination to sell their lives as dear 
as possible would have saved the coun¬ 
try and the two Springfields from 
deeds that would not be tolerated in 
hell. The mob spirit now dominates 
the country, the President is afraid to 
act, the country has got to be freed 
again and the black men have got to 
save it. Every Afro-American home 
must contain on,e or more rifles to. be 
used only in defense of law and order.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT JOINED 
THE NEGRO HATERS, 

Discussing the Bishop Turner flag 
episode, the Southwestern Christian* 
Advocate says: 

“The Bishop is neither a fool nor a 
crank, as some people pretend to be¬ 
lieve. He sees the situation as it is r 
and is brave enough to characterize 
it. Under the flag the Negro, a loyal 
citizen, has no rights which a white 
man is bound to respect, and the Pres¬ 
ident has joined himself to the race 
oppressors and agreed to be silent on 
the South’s inhuman treatment of the 
Negro. The Roosevelt that appointed 
and stood by Dr. Crumm does not ex¬ 
ist now. He is dead. Laugh at Bish¬ 
op Turner if you will, but he tells the 
truth when he says the flag does not 
protect or respect the Negro citizen ”
