ACHIEVEMENTS OF TWENTY 


If the progress of a race is to be 
in any wise judged by the capacity 
of its members to grasp intellectual 
knowledge, retain it, and use it for 
the common welfare of the masses 
of its own people as well as benefit 
the public generally, then the fol¬ 
lowing list of twenty eminent col¬ 
ored men, selected by the Negro 
Society for Historical Research of 
Yonkers, N. Y., who have won 
their spurs as authors, scientists, 
philosophers, statesmen, and war¬ 
riors is a refutation of the charge 
that the colored race is incapable 
of higher culture. The list includes: 

Francis Williams, born in 1700, 
poet, graduate of Cambridge. 

Anthony William Amo, doctor 
of philosophy, University of Wit¬ 
tenberg, 1720. 

Richard Allen, founder of the 
first Negro church in America. 

J. E. J. Capitein, Latin poet and 
linguist, University Leyden, 1720. 

Geoffrey LTslet, botanist, mem¬ 
ber French Academy Science, 1760. 

Prince Hall, founder of Negro 
Masonry in America. 

Crispins Attucka, patriot and sol¬ 
dier, Boston, 1773. 

Eustace, philanthropist, winner 
of Monthyn prize, San Domingo. 

Benjamin Bannaker, astronomer, 
born in Baltimore, 1732. 

Toussaint L’Ouverture, soldier 
and statesman, born 1743. 

Alexander Dumas, novelist. 

Alexander Pushkin, poet, the 
black Byron of Russia. 

Frederick Douglass, orator, dip¬ 
lomat and statesman. 

Brindis de Sala, Cuban violinist, 
decorated by the crowned heads of 
Europe. 


GREAT MEN 

Sir Conrad Reeves, chief justice 
of Barbados, Knight of St. George 
and St. Michael. 

Alexander Petion, civil engineer, 
Hayti. 

Paul Laurence Dunbar, poet. 

John B. Russworm, editor of the 
first Negro newspaper in New York. 

Martin R. Delaney, explorer, 
journalist and physician. 

Nathaniel Turner, prophet. 


A UTILITARIAN AGE 


We are living in a utilitarian not 
to say a materialistic age, and the 
test which is universally and in¬ 
voluntarily applied to every scien¬ 
tific discovery, every work of art, 
and every offspring of man's genius 
in every field of human effort, is 
“W'hat is it worth to the world?” 

We are richer than our forefathers. 
The centuiy has given us the 
railroad, the electric tramway, the 
20,000-ton ocean steamer, the tele¬ 
graph, the telephone, the phono¬ 
graph,. the combined harvester, 
the sewing-machine, the typewriter, 
the incandescent light, and many 
other useful and beneficent 
inventions. 

It may not be said that we have 
really retrograded or failed to 
advance in letters, or art, or oratory, 
or music; but our advance has been 
along different lines from those of 
the last century. There is no 
orator now living who occupies in 
the public estimation the same 
rank as that which was held by 
Beecher, or Chapin, or Yancey or 
Sumner, or Wendell Phillips, or 


Baker, or Starr King. There is 
no great tragic actor who has taken 
the place of Forrest of Maeready, 
or Edmund Kean, or the elder 
Booth, or Wallack. There is, in 
statesmanship, no Daniel Webster, 
no Henry Clay, no Abraham Lin¬ 
coln. There is in poetry no Byron, 
no Moore, no Tennyson, no Long¬ 
fellow, no Whittier, no Holmes. 
There is in philosophy no Macaulay, 
no Carlyle, no Motley, no Emerson, 
There is in fiction no Dickens, no 
Bulwer, no Thackeray, no Reade. 

Yet the world of activities, of 
progress and of thought is as full 
of untouched subjects for thinkers 
and writers as the universe is full 
of stars and suns that have never 
come within the sweep of a tele¬ 
scope. Maybe the Shakespeares 
and Miltons, and Beethovens and 
Angelos and Sheridans and Gold¬ 
smiths and Pitts and Gibonses 
of the Twentieth Century are now: 
toddling around the kindergartens. 
■—L. A. Times Magazine. 

And it can be added that those 
best circumstanced to enjoy all 
the benefits of this age are making 
a record that historians will not 
care to record as a guide for pos¬ 
terity. It all tends to taking away 
any premium that may be put on hu¬ 
man life.. Killing of whites, so com¬ 
mon, is brought about by the prac¬ 
tice of killing human beings in the 
savage and brutal manner such as 
lynchings, burning, butchering of 
Negroes. 

“II fares the land to hastening 

ills a prey, 

Where wealth accumulates and 

men decay.”

SANTA MONICA 


|k»A -successful revival was closed 
at the C. M, E. Church Monday 
evening by tendering a reception 
to'Rev: J; Gordon McPherson who 
conducted the meetings. The most 
interesting numbers on the pro¬ 
gram, besides the brief address of 
Rev. McPherson was the Rousseau 
family of musicians and Mrs. 
Mable E. Walker Davis. The Ros- 
seau’s a family of six little children 
whose ages range from 11 years to 
18 months, delighted the audience 
with three selections using different 
instruments each time. Mrs. 
Davis appeared first delivering an 
address on the possibilities of woman 
since her enfranchisement and after¬ 
wards she sang two beautiful selec¬ 
tions. 

Rev. McPherson was to have 
delivered an extended address on 
fiis experiences at San Juan Hill 
dut owing to the lateness of the 
hour his remarks though interesting 
were necessarily brief. Refresh¬ 
ments were served at the close. 
The audience was composed of 
both white and colored people. 


Mrs. Pm don of the city while 
visiting her mother Mrs. Herd 
assisted her in entertaining Rev, 
McPherson, Rev. Smith and Mrs. 
Kelsey early Sunday afternoon. 
They were entertained later in 
the evening by Mrs. Carter.

Mr. Grice the editor of the Pacific 
Plaindealer with his family will

Irwin Heights. 


The first real estate business to 
be opened by the colored people 
of Santa Monica was started by 
editor Grice and Mr. J. E. White. 


Mrs. Mable E. Walker Davis of 
Portland, Oregon expects to make 
Santa Monica her home and will 
teach music. 


SOMEWHAT WINDY 


A windstorm broke out in the 
Forum, over the admission of 
colored girls into the training de¬ 
partment of the County hospital 
as usual the noise was made by 
thoughtless windbags. After the 
fuss had subsided the chief pro¬ 
duced. a big bundle of 
meaningless resolutions long enongh 
to make a small volume which were 
adopted without a dissenting vote. 
In all probability they will be 
consigned to the waste basket as 
soon as they reach the board of 
supervisors for it would cost the 
county at least $100.00 in loss of 
time to read them. The resolu¬ 
tions would be alright if they meant 
anything. It will 'Take votes to 
settle that hospital business. 


Mrs. N. Weatherton of Pasadena 
is in need of several girls for per¬ 
manent positions in that city, see

The white and colored Baptists 
of Santa Monica and Ocean Park 
are signing a petition urging Rev. 
J. Gordon McPherson to take charge 
of the Baptist Church, left 
vacant by the death of Rev. Kelsey, 
This is a move in the right direc¬ 
tion. Rev. McPherson is a man 
of ability and we believe him to be 
worthy. From what we have seen 
of him we believe him to be just 
the man for the place. 


The Pansy circle gave a Box 
social at the home of Mrs. M. C. 
Edmonds, 1360 East 33rd street, 
Tuesday evening last. Mr. Otis 
Long acted as auctioneer, for the 
occasion. 


THE MANNER OF BOYS AND 
GIRLS 

Hearing a young man address a 
young girl by her first name, I 
asked, “How long have you- known 
"that girl?’' “About a week.,-” was 
the reply. “Did I hear you call 
her “Maude” “Yes,” “And you 
have known her only a week?” 
The young fellow replied, “Why, 
she calls me‘Tom/ This familiar- 
arity caused me to have some serious 
thoughts on the manners of young 
boys and girls. The latter are in 
a great. measure responsible for 
any familiarity a young man may 
assume. 

If a girl meets a fellow half w r ay 
and adopts the slang of the present 
day, she may be sure he wall feel 
he is permitted to be very familiar. 
A modest well-behaved girl will 
never wish to attract attention, but 
a forward girl will enter a street 
car and, by loud talking, attract the 
attention of the whole car. If girls 
only knew how much more they were 
admired and respected for quiet, 
lady-like manners, they would cer¬ 
tainly cultivate them. 

# It depends entirely upon the 
girl to keep a boy at the proper 
distance; if he does not respect a 
girl enough to behave in her presence 
she can easily make him do so. 

Young people ought to have a 
good time, and we do not believe 
in too much restraint being put 
upon them, but a good time does 
not depend upon loud and boister¬ 
ous behavior in the street or else¬ 
where, and such manners in either 
a boy or a girl not only hurts them, 
but reflects often upon parents who 
have done their best to raise their 
children right—Christian Witness.

A NEW COLORED LAW FIRM 


Announcement is made of the 
organization of a Colored firm of 
lawyers, in the city; it is composed 
of Attorney Chas. S. Darden, a 
well known and successful prac¬ 
titioner of Los Angeles and E, 
Burton Ceruti of Brooklyn, New 
York, Attorney Ceruti is well 
known in Fraternal Circles and is 
the Grand Legal Adviser to the 
National Body of Elks. The firm 
of Garden & Ceruti will practice 
in all the State and Federal Courts. 


We regret very much to learn of 
the serious illness of Earnest Mc¬ 
Coy of Duarte. 


THE NEGROES GREAT 
NEED 


Criticism of alleged discrimina¬ 
tion toward Indians at the expense 
of colored citizens is made a part 
of the annual report of Howard 
university, forwarded to the secre¬ 
tary of the interior by President 
Thirkield. He pointed out that 
for the 250,000 Indians in the Uni¬ 
ted States the government last 
year spent $1,430,000, while-for 
the 10,000,000 Negroes only $100,- 
000 was appropriated, 

“Yet colored teachers in com¬ 
mon and high schools,” the report 
continues, “are expected to meet 
the requirements of State authori¬ 
ties. To practice medicine a color¬ 
ed man is required to pass the same 
examination before State boards 
as white physicians. So also in 
other professions and pursuits, pro¬ 
vision must be made for these 10,- 
000,000 colored citizens, else it 
will mean the blind leading the 
blind and both falling into the 
ditch, at great cost to society and 
the State.” 

In order to further emphasize 
the greater need of government 
aid Dr. Thirkield in his report says: 

“ While the Rockfeller fund of 
$1,000,000 is available for eradi¬ 
cation of the hookworm, yet there 
is the Negro race with tuberculosis, 
typhoid, and other diseases wiping 
out tens of thousands and lowering 
the vitality and physical efficiency 
of a race. At the same time their 
condition is a positive menace to 
the white race, with which it is so 
closely bound up. It is a question 
of national interest. Here is a 
race multitudes of whom are still 
the prey of voodoo doctors and con¬ 
jure men and given to patent nos¬ 
trums. The pressing need is for 
the training of men for the instruc¬ 
tion of the ignorant and supersti¬ 
tious, men with scientific know¬ 
ledge and broad views of medicine, 
men who can put medical knowledge 
in simple form before the masses 
and through preventive medicine 
raise the vitality of a race that is 
being decimated by disease.”

THE LYCEUM 


• Attorney Ceruti was greeted last 
Sunday by a large and cultured 
audience. The majority being well 
gowned, cultured ladies lent unusual 
grace to the occasion. The num¬ 
ber of business and professional 
men was larger than usual. 

. The address by Attorney Ceruti 
was one of those plain heart to heart 
talks that always makes a lasting 
impression. He touched upon many 
phrases of the problems confronting 
the Negroes discussing at con¬ 
siderable length the use and sacred¬ 
ness of the ballot. He especially 
urged the voters—men and women 
—-to fit themselves for the exer¬ 
cise of the franchise by studying 


the issues, men and the platforms 
upon which they run for office. 
He urged the necessity of organiza¬ 
tion along political lines for the 
purpose of securing the representa¬ 
tion due them by virtue of their 
voting strength. 

Against Segregation. 

He warned the audience against 
lending its aid to segregation as 
dangerous no difference how harm¬ 
less such movements appear upon 
their face. The jim crow legis¬ 
lation of the South was used to 
illustrate his point. The segrega¬ 
tion laws of the South look fair 
upon the surface but beneath they 
mean for the Negroes, disfranchise¬ 
ment, poor schools or none, pool- 
traveling accommodations and no 
protection under the law. What 
segregation means in the South, 
it can be made to mean anywhere 
else in this country. 


DARDIN & CERUTI 


Dardin and Ceruti the new col¬ 
ored law firm whose announcement 
appears elsewhere in these columns 
attention to which is especially 
invited. 

Since his admission to the bar 
several years ago, Attorney Dardin 
has made a good record and stands 
well in the courts. His defense 
and rescue of Edward Silver from 
the gallows and his recent victory 
in the state supreme court in the 
case of Washington vs. Randall 
has demonstrated his legal ability. 
The interest he takes in matters 
wherein the people are interested 
has put him in close touch with 
them. 

Mr. E. Burton Ceruti the junior 
member of the firm who is a grad¬ 
uate of the Brooklyn College of 
law of Brooklyn, N. Y., comes here 
from that city and was admitted 
to the bar in this state on the 
17th instant. Mr. Ceruti stands 
high in the Order of Elks of the 
World having served three years 
as National Grand Receiver of 
that order. He is legal advisor 
of the Order and represents it 
in two cases now pending, one 


before the N. Y. Supreme Court 
and the other in the U. S. Circuit 
Court for the eastern District of Ya. 

These gentlemen possess quali¬ 
fications that can make a strong 
firm. 


A MAMMOTH EDITION COMING 


The twelfth anniversary edition 
of The Liberator will be published 
April 1st. It will be a mammoth 
edition and will contain hundreds 
of portraits of the leading colored 
men of the state. Ministers, law¬ 
yers, Doctors, Merchants and men 
who are making their marks in

Pacific Coast. Cuts of many of 
the splendid homes owned by the 
colored people will also appear: 
Churches, lodges, stores and offices 
of our business and professional 
men and women will testify as to 
the Negro’s splendid achievements 
in this wonderland of the great 
west. How a mere handful of 
colored people in this city grew to 
20,000 in 15 years, accumulating 
millions of wealth will be graphic¬ 
ally told. 

This mammoth edition will be 
mailed to every part of .the civi¬ 
lized world and will be a perpetual 
memorial of Negro achievement.

GO AND SEE IT 


Accepting an invitation from 
the market gardners of Linwood 
Acres to visit- them prepared to 
examine their land and tell them 
what to plant and how to plant it’ 
We icallecl upon them Wednesday.. 
This honor was conferred upon the 
editor because he is a farmer, 
believes in the soil and never losse 
an opportunity to encourage over¬ 
worked struggling city people to go 
back to the farm and rest. Accom¬ 
panied by Mr. Clarence Harris, 
Mr. Harry Mitchell the .well known 
real estate dealer and promotor, 
took us down in his fine 32 horse¬ 
power machine. After a short drive 
we reached Compton ave., a splendid 
country highway, broad, oil-paved, 
dustless; is almost as smooth as 
glass. The auto joy riders from the 
city to the-sea who choose that pop¬ 
ular highway,are so numerous that 
they form an almost unbroken 
stream. 

Passing through the thriving 
town of Watts, we-reached Linwood 
to find everything on the move. 
The streets had been laid out and 
cement sidewalks laid on the north 


side of all streets. The, rich mel¬ 
low soil is being planted to pota¬ 
toes and other vegetables. Mrs. 
Hearty of Colorado has two acres 
and a neat five room cottage. She 
will plant the whole to potatoes 
and sweet com and pumpkins will 
be planted for a second crop. 
The land is rich and damp and 
both crops can be grown without 
irrigation. The tract has an abund¬ 
ant supply of artesian water, so 
crops can be irrigated if necessary. 

Mr. (Vm. Walker recently from 
Oklahoma, will make a specialty 
of truck gardening and will be the 
leading farmer of the tract. He is 
putting his land in excellent shape 
which always tells in the end. 

This splendid land is on the 
market at $1,200 per acre, the 
cheapest land in that locality. 
Undivided lands adjoining that 
tract are held at $1,500 per acre, 
in lots of 20 acres or more. For 
$500 cash on an acre, Mr. Mitchell 
will build cottages to suit purchaser, 
balance by a small monthly pay¬ 
ment. 

For the home seeker here is 
an unparalled opportunity to be¬ 
come independent. 

Go and see it. 


MOTHER’S MEETING A SUCCESS 


The Mother’s meeting at the 
A. M. E. Church was very largely 
attended, the meeting which was 
held under the auspices of the 
Woman’s Progressive Club, re¬ 
flected much credit upon them. 
The object of the meeting was to 
raise funds to assist in paying off 
a $2,000 balance due on the grounds 
for the Working Girl’s Home. 

Prof. Moore delivered an able 
and instructive address on the 
life and work of Sojourner Truth. 
His detail of the struggles and 
triumphs of that noble woman was 
full of inspiration. The life his¬ 
tory of that great woman should 
be in the possession of every mem¬ 
ber of our race, especially the 
younger members. It is unfor¬ 
tunate indeed that the mass of our 
people know so little of the great 
Negroes who have added in moving 
the world along. Much credit for 
the success of the meeting is due 
Madames Oliver and Scott of the 
State Federation of Woman’s Clubs.
