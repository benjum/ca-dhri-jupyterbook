COL. ROBERT G. INGERSOLL DEFINES 

RACE SUPERIORITY 


“Liberty is not a social question. 
We are equal only in rights. No 
two persons are of equal weight, 
or height. There are no two 
leaves in all the forests of the 
earth alike—no two blades of grass 
—no two grains of sand—no two 
hairs. No two anythings in the 
physical world are precisely alike. 
Neither mental nor physical equal¬ 
ity can be created by law, but 
law recognizes the fact that all 
men have been clothed with equal 
rights by nature, the mother of. 
us all. 

The man who hates the black 
man, because he is black, has the 
same spirit as he who hates the 
poor man, because he is poor. 
It is the spirit of caste. The 
proud useless despises the honest 
useful. The parasite idleness 
scorns the great oak of labor on 
which it feeds and that lifts it to 
the light. 

I am the inferior of any man 
whose rights 1 trample under foot. 
Men arenot superior by reason of 
race or color. They are superior 
who have the best heart—the best 
brain. Superiority is born of hon¬ 
esty, of virtue, of charity, and 
above all, of the love of liberty. 
The superior man is the providence 
of the inferior. He is eyes for the 
blind, strength for the weak, and 
shields for the defenseless. He 
stands erect by bending above the 
fallen. He rises by lifting others.” 

If the American pulpits of to-day 
were filled with ministers who 
lived the Christ life as Col. Inger- 
soll lived it, this country would 
not be reaping such a harvest of 
crime. Ministers of the gospel are 


so inconsistent that the church 
has lost its influence. The criminal 
class among the whites, is no 
longer the ignorant, but the 
educated class. Church mem¬ 
bers vote for the open saloon with 
its dens of vice and shame. Burn¬ 
ings at the^stake and all forms of 
mob murders have the silent en¬ 
dorsement of the pulpit.” 

It is not surprising that the giant 
intellect and human spirit Col. 
Ingersoll possessed should take issue 
with Christianity as represented 
by the American church. 

If this country is to be saved 
from infidelity and worse the pul¬ 
pits will have" to be filled with men 
who love men. 

At the Civil Rights Mass Meeting- 
held in Washington, D. C., Oct. 
22, 1883 the Hon. Frederick Doug¬ 
lass introduced the great Agnostic 
as follows: 

“Abou Ben Adhem—may his tribe 
increase! 

Awoke one night from a deep dream 
of peace, 

And saw, within the moonlight in 
his room, 

Making it rich, like a lily in bloom, 
An angel, wilting in a book of gold: 
Exceeding peace had made Ben 
Adhem bold; 

And to the presence in the room 
he said, 

“What writest thou?” The vision 
raised its head,. 

And with a look made all of sweet 
accord, 

Anwswered, “The names of those 
who love the Lord.” 

“And is mine one?” said Abou. 
“Nay, not so;” 


Replied the angel. Abou spoke 
more low, 

But cheerily still, and said: “ ] pray 
thee, then, 

Write me as one who loves his 
fellow-men.” 

The angel wrote and vanished. 
The next night 

It came again, with a great waken- , 

ing light, 

And showed the names whom love 
of God had blest; 

And lo! Ben Adhem’s name led 
all the rest.” 

I have the honor to introduce 
Robert G. Ingersoll. 

MR. C. C. FLINT FOR CITY 
COUNCILMAN 

At the urgent request of a large 
number of prominent white and 
colored business men, Mr. C. G. 
Flint the well known and popular 
grocer has consented to be a can¬ 
didate for city council two years 
hence. This announcement will 
meet the approval of the entire 
Negro voting population. Mr. 
Flint has been a resident of the 
city twenty five years and has been 
identified with every movement 
for the advancement of his rate. 
He is a member in good standing 
of the Merchant’s Exchange, has 
a first class rating in Bradstreet. 
and Dunn. The big grocery busi¬ 
ness that Mr. Flint has built up 
is proof that he is a man of affairs 
and is in every way capable to 
serve in the city council. 

As candidate, Mr. Flint will 
have the solid support of ‘the 
colored voters and taking the Whit¬ 
ley vote as a criterion, he* will

THE LIBERATOR 


easily poll 65,000 to 75,000 white 
votes. Running on an unpopular 
ticket with the odds all against him, 
Whitley polled 40,000 votes. 

Negroes have been voting for 
white men for nearly 50 years, 
and in asking white men to vote 
for a Negro who is fitted for the 
position for which he aspires, is 
asking no more than what is due 
them. 

The spirit of fair play shown the 
Negro recently by thousands of 
•white people in this city is indeed 
commendable and will prove a 
mighty incentive to the Negroes 
in their struggle for a higher and 
better citizenship. Taxation with¬ 
out representation is just what it 
was in 1776. 


CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT 

The Supreme Court of the United 
States handed down an opinion last 
Monday which will have a far- 
reaching effect upon the “Jim- 
Crow” Seperate Car laws in the 
several Southern States, if it is 
carried to its logical conclusion. 
It will result in a basis of estab¬ 
lished equality of service and privi¬ 
leges upon lines wholly within the 
confines of a State and eliminate 
many of the abuses from which 
intra-state passengers suffer. 

Certainly if a passenger traveling 
from one State to another must be 
accorded equal rights and privi¬ 
leges with every other passenger, 
then passengers traveling from 
point to point wholly within a 
State must be accorded the same 
rights and privileges. The colored 
passenger from New York being 
guaranteed equal rights and privi¬ 
leges by the Interstate Commerce 
Commission sits in the car with 
the colored passenger traveling 
wholly within the confines of a 
Southern State. 

The decision was rendered by a 
unanimous court, with a State’s 
right De nocratic Chief Justice pre¬ 
siding. The question raised involv¬ 
ed the enforcement of the Federal 


safety appliance act on railroad 
branches wholly within the con¬ 
fines of the State. In protecting 
human lives by its premises and 
argument, it protects human rights 
and deals a “body blow” to the 
cherished right of States and took 
one long step forward in the march 
of nationalism, which Hon. Wil¬ 
liam J. Bryan is pleased to term 
imperialism. It may not be that 
“God is fighting for Israel” in these 
cases, but it does look as though 
great principles are asserting them¬ 
selves, to the confusion of the poli¬ 
ticians and the Negro-haters of 
the country.

T. McCANTS STEWART ON 
LIBERIA 

On the eve of inaugurating a 
new administration, with leanings 
decidedly American, Liberia offers 
to-day the best opportunity abroad 
for investment of American money 
according to a statement issued 
in New York yesterday by Judge 
T. McCants Stewart of the Liberian 
Supreme Court. The quickening 
of United States interest in the 
Negro republic, Judge Stewart adds, 
is evinced by a recent loan of 
1600,000 by “New York bankers 
to Liberia with which to settle its 
domestic debts and what he terms 
American intervention in Liberia’s 
financial affairs, greatly to Liberia’s 
advantage. Judge Stewart is visit¬ 
ing America on a twofold mission 
the codification and publication. of 
the laws of his country, which 
have been issued in pamphlet form 
only during the past half a cen¬ 
tury; and furtherance of negotia¬ 
tions between his government and 
the State department. American 
interest in Liberian finances has 
fathered the hope in his country, 
Judge Stewart declared, that the 
United States will extend its in¬ 
terest to strengthening its com¬ 
mercial ties with his country. D. 
E. Howard, president-elect of Li¬ 
beria and D. Harmon, a merchant 
of Bassa, elected recently to the 
vice-presidency, will be inaugurated 
on January 1. Both the president 
and vice-president, Judge Stewart 
says, are men of strong American 
tendencies. Judge Stewart said 
that he had conferred with Secre¬ 
tary Knox recently, regarding the 
diplomatic negotiations pending be¬ 
tween , America and Liberia. He 
expects to sail for home to-morrow.

PROGRESS OF SOCIALISM 

There are many who are surprised 
at the growth of Socialism in the 
United States in the past decade. 
There was a time when it was 
thought that Socialism would never 
make headway in this country, 
but every new election held marks 
the progress of the Socialist propa¬ 
ganda in the United States. There 
are now 435 Socialists holding 
elective offices in this country, 
distributed in 33 States. They 
include one Congressman, a State 
Senator and 28 mayors, numerous 
aldermen and other offices of more 
or less importance in various muni¬ 
cipalities. In Los Angeles during 
the past few days the Socialist 
nominee received more votes than 
either nominee of the old line par¬ 
ties.—Exchange. 


THE PROGRESSIVE WOMAN’S 
CLUB MEET 


The all day meeting held by the 
Federation of Clubs which convened 
on the 7th, Avas largely attended. At 
the close of the program, which was 
well received, a donation was taken 
for charity. The club is making 
preparations to entertain the State 
Federation next year. Mrs. Oliver 
entertained the club yesterday at 
2018 Darwin Avenue. 

A mother’s meeting will be held 
at the OddfelloAv’s Hall on Sun¬ 
day afternoon, December 17th. 


THE LYCEUM 


The meeting at the Lyceum 
Sunday, proved to be very inter¬ 
esting in spite of the fact that the 
members had not fully recovered 
from the wear and tear of the 
campaign. After the discussion of 
current topics, some incidents of 
the campaign Avere discussed. 

A colored Socialist present, ably 
defended Socialism and declared 
that it would rise out of the dust 
of defeat and be as full of fight as 
ever. 


STRONG INSURANCE 
COMPANY 

The Atlanta Mutual Insurance 
Association furnishes a remarkable 
instance of racial co-operation and 
progress in the gigantic strides it 
has made in the last feAv years. 
Organized less than ten years ago 
with one branch office, two agents 
and $50,000 worth of insurance 
outstanding. It now operates, in 
three States, viz., Georgia, Alabama 
and Kentucky, boasts of .85,000 
satisfied policy-holders, has placed 
more than $1,000,000 worth of 
insurance, and employs 600 people. 
It has the distinction of being the 
first colored company admitted’to 
do business in Kentucky, and the 
further distinction of having its 
president sign a check for a bond 
pin-chase for a larger amount than 
any coloi’ed man had ever drawn 4

THE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND 
THE DOOR OF HOPE 

Will the Negroes be given their 
old places in the parks—the places 
they held under Snyder and Har¬ 
per, the two democratic mayors? 
is being asked on every hand. 
In spite of the fact that the Negroes 
lost their jobs in the parks and 
their wagons were taken off the 
street under the Good Government 
rede, when Socialism threatened 
to engulf the Good Government 
ticket and its candidates cried lustily 
for help the colored voters 
went to the rescue with a rush. 
Will they be forgotten? Will the 


park gates remain closed to the 
Negroes? Is cleaning streets and 
spit-toons all that the Negro voters 
deserve? Is that all he is to have? 

We shall see. 


40,000 VOTES FOR WHITLEY 


That the Socialists supported 
Whitley loyally is shown by his 
big vote. In spite of the teriffic 
fight made upon the Socialist ticket 
and the appeals to race prejudice 
made quietly against him by the 
opposition, the vote he polled was 
simply marvelous. The Socialists 
by the vote they gave Whitley 
have set an example that other 
political organizations will do well 
to follow. 

There is nothing more gratifying 
in this connection than the fact 
that the ancient breach between 
the Negroes and poor whites is 
being slowly closed as this vote 
plainly shows. And if Whitley’s 
candidacy did nothing else, the 
proof it gave that there are thous¬ 
ands and thousands of white 
people who are willing and even 
anxious to give the Negro a square 
deal is worth more to all concerned 
than many times the cost of his 
campaign. He failed to reach the 
office but gained more for his race. 

It is a defeat that holds within 
its grasp coming victories. 

The breach between the work¬ 
ing whiteman and Negroes is be¬ 
ing closed for the mutual benefit 
of both. In this matter the white 
men are taking the initiative and 
should be met half way by the 
Negroes. The interests of the poor 
white man and Negroes are iden¬ 
tical; the injury of one is injury 
of both. The sooner this is under¬ 
stood the better for all concerned. 
The Negro who makes slu ring- 
remarks about poor white folks 
is doing himself and race no good. 
Such Negroes create enemies 
among the poor whites while earn¬ 
ing the contempt of the wealthy. 
Once the Negroes and poor whites 
get together for mutual helpfulness 
both will receive better consider¬ 
ation from the people of wealth. 


NERGOES VOTED FOR DEMO= 
CRATS 

At the recent city election thous¬ 
ands of Negro men and women 
voted for four Democrats and 
elected six to office. There were 
four Democrats on the Good Gov¬ 
ernment ticket and under the new 
charter, Mayor Alexander will ap¬ 
point the city treasurer and city 
clerk, both of whom are Democrats. 
Four of the six Democrats who got 
office by virtue of the Negro fran¬ 
chise are from the South and left 
there since the Negroes were dis¬ 
franchised. The only remarkable 
thing about this matter is, that 
if these democrats had run on a 
Democratic ticket, the bulk of 
these colored voters, not only 
would have voted solidly against 
them, but would have urged os¬ 
tracism for any Negro who voted 
for them. With the words Repub¬ 
lican and Democrat taken off the 
ballot the blind Negro partisan is 
in the position of the man who 
although hating the sight of cats 
ate one supposing it to be fried 
squirrel. 

COLORED TROOPS AT ALLENS= 
WORTH 

A company of colored troops 
en route to the Philippines was 
given a lay over of 15 minutes at 
Allensworth by the Santa Fe R. 
R. last week. The soldiers were 
well pleased with the colony and 
a number of them will buy homes 
and reside there on retiring from 
the army.
