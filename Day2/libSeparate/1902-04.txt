Business Men’s Associa¬ 
tion Elects Officers. 


Now a Chartered Institution 
Its Capital in Demand 

Under its charter the Los Angeles 
Business Men’s Association has elected 
its officers, and those requiring bonds 
have qualified and the business matters 
of the association are rapidly shaping 
themselves. The following list of of¬ 
ficers is a guarantee of its good faith 
and gains for the organization the 
confidence of the public generally.: 
President, Dr. Geo. D. Taylor; vice- 
president, Eugene Walker; treasurer, 
J. H. Jamison; business manager, R. 
C. Owens; secretary, James M. Vena; 
board of directors, C. W. Holden, J. 
L. Edmonds, R. C. Owens, H. Strick¬ 
lin, Eugene Walker, Dr. Geo. D. Tay¬ 
lor, James M. Vena. Comment is un¬ 
necessary. 

There is a healthy demand for 
shares of the company’s capital stock, 
which is $25,000, but owing to neces¬ 
sary routine business the amount of 
stock to be floated has not been de¬ 
cided upon. This will be decided at 
the next meeting of the board of di¬ 
rectors. The dues received for stock 
sold amount to $104 per month, and 
are paid promptly on the first of the 
month. The association will have no 
difficulty in selling one thousand 
shares of its capital stock, as the de¬ 
mand for it si not confined to this 
state. The earnings from sales will 
be invested in real estate, building and 
loan and other business that will 
serve as a means of giving employment 
to colored people so as to better their 
financial condition. Available lands 
will be purchased and colonies estab¬ 
lished and farming encouraged. The 
tide of colored emigration to this state 
is steadily increasing; many of the 
emigrants are persons of intelligence 
and means. The association will assist 
these people in securing proper loca¬ 
tions and furnish them with such aid 
as they may need until they get on 
foot. The colored people of this city 
have $100,000 deposited in banks or 
in building and loan associations for 
which they get no credit and gives the 
members of the race not a day’s work. 


A realization of this fact has made the 
association necessary in order that 
this state of affairs be changed by in¬ 
vesting the earnings of the race in 
a way that will not only give them em¬ 
ployment, but will raise their business 
standing in the community. 

The fact that the association has the 
confidence of the entire community 
broadens its opportunities, makes its 
ultimate success easier, but increases 
its responsibilities. The association 
has a rare and magnificent opportunity 
to create new avenues in which the 
earnings of the race, which are now 
used to no purpose, may be turned 
with profit and credit to all concerned. 
It can increase the worth of the 
negro by turning his attention to busi¬ 
ness 'and the things that will raise 
him in the estimation of his fellow cit¬ 
izens. This is the ambition of those 
composing the association. The offi¬ 
cers are equal to the task. 


MR. EUGENE WALKER, vice-pres¬ 
ident of the association, is a tailor, 
well known in business circles. He is 
a business man who is indebted to 
none but himself for the success he is 
making. His tailoring establishment 
is a monument to his tact, push and 
untiring energy. He is a valuable 
member of the association, whose 
opinion in business and other matters 
is respected. 


Two white women shot down in cold 
blood by white men, one of them on 
the street, one white man in Pasadena 
charged with incest, one from Pomo¬ 
na charged with rape,half dozen deadly 
assaults upon white women by whrte 
men in this city, fifteen or more sui¬ 
cides, all white, one policeman dis¬ 
missed for stealing eggs, this and 
scores of other offenses are the record 
of the past 60 clays. What a field of 
labor laying all out of doors for Mad¬ 
ams Burdette, Chapin and Graves. 



DR. GEO. D. TAYLOR. 


The new president of the Los Ange¬ 
les Business Men’s Association is a 
practical, up-to-date young man. He 
is a successful physician, a man of 
broad, liberal "*ews, progressive, 


energetic, well known and popular for 
his integrity and personal worth. His 
selection was an exhibition of good 
judgment on the part of the associa¬ 
tion and strengthens it in the public 
confidence.

MR. JAMES M- VENA, who succeeds 
himself as secretary of the Business 
Men’s Association, is one of “Uncle 
Sam’s” clerks in the city pcstoffice. 


His ability, integrity, worth and ex¬ 
perience have made him a necessity to 
the organization. He is well known 
and h'ghly resepected in business, in¬ 
tellectual and social circles. 


MR. C. W. HOLDEN. Like the other 
officers of the association, Mr. Holden, 
who is a member of the board of di¬ 
rectors, was selected for his position 
because the position needed him. Am¬ 
ong the officers few are better known 
and none are more highly respected. 
His success as a rancher is an example 
of what colored men can do who are 
wiping to work. 


R. C. OWENS. 


MR. R. C. OWENS, business mana¬ 
ger of the association, comes of a 
pioneer family, who are well and fa¬ 
vorably known in business and real 
estate circles. He has ample means 
and is cautious in his investments; 
therefore his connection with the as¬ 
sociation has done much to inspire 
confidence in . its reliability. Mr. 
Owen owns some of the finest property 
in the city. Besides his fine resi¬ 
dence, corner of Tenth and Albany 
streets, he owns a block on Spring 
street, which is worth a fortune. He is 
street, is worth a fortune. He is pre¬ 
will engage in real estate and .insur¬ 
ance business. Mr. Owens is a native 
of this city and is very popular.

MR. JOHN SAUNDERS. 

Mr. Saunders who is a large stock¬ 
holder in the Business Men’s Associa¬ 
tion is a practical railroad man hav¬ 
ing been in the employ of the Santa 
Fe’s General Manager's private car 
for many years. Two genial 
managers have died, and he is 
now serving the third. This shows 
how well he has performed his 
duties. In saving his earnings he has 
done equally well and has considerable 
invested in business in this city. He 
is a working member of Rev. Edwards' 
church where he can be found at any 
service when in the city. The club or 
dive which is too often the undoing of 
railroad men has no attractions for 
him. He is a liberal supporter of the 
race enterprises, and can be depended 
upon to assist any cause for the ad¬ 
vancement of the race. 


MR. J. H. JAMISON, treasurer of 
the association, is a wholesale dealer 
in junk and does business throughout 
Southern California. He buys from 
local dealers in hundred ton lots,ship¬ 


ping it to the wholesale dealers in San 
Francisco. His square dealings has 
built him a business that is worth sev¬ 
eral thousand dollars annually. His 
bond as treasurer was promptly made 
by the bond insurance company. Mr. 
Jamison on being elected treasurer of¬ 
fered to make a cash bond by making 
a deposit of two thousand dollars in 
the bank to be subject to the order of 
the association in case of default dur¬ 
ing his incumbancy, but the associa¬ 
tion deemed this unfair to him and 
ordered the insurance on his bond 
paid out of the treasury. This in¬ 
cident showed not only his desire to 
make the association safe, but his 
financial standing as well. A gentle¬ 
man who was making a deal with Mr. 
Jamison which involved a thousand 
or more dollars called upon the presi¬ 
dent of the bank where Jamison did 
business to inquire as to his standing 
in that institution and was informed 
that his check for two or three thou¬ 
sand dollars would he honored whether 
he had any money in their vaults or 
not. He owns valuable real estate in 
the city, including his neat cottage, 
722 Mateo street. 


REV. J. E. EDWARDS. 

Rev. Edwards who was a delegate to 
the late EcuminicalConference in Lon¬ 
don, England is now engaged in rais¬ 
ing funds to build a new church. The 
congregation under his pastorate has 
outgrown his present place of worship, 
popularly known as the “Azusa Street 
Church." His whole church have en¬ 
tered into the spirit of the work and 
the movement is going forward with 
a will. Rev. Edwards was winner in 
the popular voting contest held some 
time since. He received 945 votes, 
Rev. Donohoo who was a close second 
received 737.

GOVERNOR GAGE. 


The fight among the Republicans for 
Governor Gage’s place is waxing warm 
and according to The Times he is al¬ 
ready defeated for re-nomination. 
While the fight against the Governor 
seems to be assuming ugly propor¬ 
tions, the convention has not yet as¬ 
sembled and the Governor still com¬ 
mands the works. Whether he can be 
beaten on the home run or not is giv¬ 
ing his opponents considerable 
concern in spite of their san¬ 
guine claims. While we are not en¬ 
titled to any credit for the Governor’s 
administration it is stating a truth to 
say that his administration has been 
as good as any other Republican 
would have given the state. To us it 
seems only a case of wanting to swop 
jobs. As to that there are some real 
good capable Democrats in this state 
who would like to do the same thing 
and they will do it if they have half a 
chance. In every party there are some 
perhaps who would like to run the ad¬ 


ministration, who, if turned down, dis¬ 
cover that it needs changing. Let that 
be as it may, there is one thing that 
nobody will deny and that is this: He 
has given the colored voters of this 
state a more substantial recognition 
than any governor the state ever had. 
His appointment of Attorney Wickliffe 
to a position in the office of the harbor 
commissioners was a recognition of 
the negroes’ intellectual qualifications, 
thereby placing those who supported 
the party on a level with its other sup¬ 
porters. This is right and just to all. 
There may be others who would do the 
same thing, but Governor Gage is the 
only one that has ever done it. Now, 
if the governor is to be turned down, 
we will do our best to help land an¬ 
other gentleman in his chair that we 
believe will do just as he has done, re¬ 
gardless of the party in which he is 
found.

A DEAD SHERIFF: Sheriff Gassa- 
way of Tuscumbia, Alabama is dead. 
His death is the direct result of the 
perfidious practice of officers arresting 
negroes and turning them over un¬ 
armed to mobs which put them to 
death without a trial. If he had ar¬ 
rested Will Reynolds, Reynolds cer¬ 
tainly would have been lynched, this 
he knew and resolved to sell his life 
as dear as possible. The sheriff who 
doubtlessly was leading the mob be¬ 
came first victim of Reynold’s deadly 
aim. According to The Examiner’s 
report which is correct, Reynolds kil¬ 
led seven and wounded 21 of the mob 
beside killing 7 or 8 horses. His aim 
was deliberate and the execution sim¬ 
ply terrible. While we regret the ter¬ 
rible loss of life in the battle there was 
nothing else for Reynolds to do, to 
surrender after the battle opened 
meant death at the stake, perhaps. The 
whole thing is deplorable but it is the 
legitimate result of mob law. As de¬ 
plorable as this thing is no man ought 
allow himself to be turned over to a 
mob if he can prevent it by the deadly 
use of fire arms. The blood of Sheriff 
Gassaway is on every mob sympathizer 
in this country and all of those who 
has in any way aided in propagating 
mob sentiment. Things for which ne¬ 
groes have been lynched without trials 
have been so many and trivial that to 
be arrested is to be lyncned. Now as 
juries do not regard lynchingand burn¬ 
ing at the stake as murder, the negro 


charged with offense has but one alter¬ 
native to escape being lynched and 
that is to arm himself anu .:ill every 
body in sight until he is killed. It is 
a desperate remedy for a desperate dis¬ 
ease. How long will lynch law be tol¬ 
erated? 

“The wages of sin is death.”

Mr. Stafford, city engineer, appoint¬ 
ed Mr. W. F. Henderson to the po¬ 
sition in his department made vacant 
by the resignation of Mr. James M. 
Vena. The appointment gives general 
satisfaction to the colored voters with 
whom Mr. Stafford is very popular. 
There were several candidates for the 
place but the demand for Mr. Hender¬ 
son’s appointment was so general that 
the place was given to him. 


REV. F. L. DONOHOO. 

The election of Rev. Donohoo as 
delegates to the International Sunday 
School convention, which convenes at 
Denver, Colo., June 22nd, is a merited 
honor. The convention which elected 
h'm was composed of 365 delegates 
representing the Sunday Schools of 
all denominations in Southern Califor¬ 
nia. The fact that there were only 
14 colored delegates in the convention 
makes the election of Rev. Donohoo 
all the more significant. It was the 
simple recognition of the worth of an 
able, conscientious Christian gentle¬ 
man. No* minister in the city, all 
things considered, has done greater 
work in the cause of Christ and the 
general uplifting of society than Rev. 
Donohoo has done. His ability has 
been recognized signally in every con¬ 
vention in which he has sat as a dele¬ 
gate, and he has secured from the 
great M. E. church higher recognition 
fcr the colored people of this city 
than was ever accorded them before. 
It is indeed pleasing to note that he 
ils loved and respected for his worth 
by the intelligent Christian colored 
people of all denominations. At Den¬ 
ver the colored Sunday Schools of 
Southern California will be ably repre¬ 
sented and he will be amply pro¬ 
vided for, so that he can fittingly rep¬ 
resent this great section in that august 
body. It is a great honor bestowed 
upon us all.

Only a Matter of Taste. 


The Record is Free. 

MRS. W. L. GRAVES HAS AN OR¬ 
GAN. 

Under the scare head of “MRS. W. 

L. GRAVES THREATENED BY NE¬ 
GRO WOMEN,” The Record of March 
13th told a tale of woe, about anony¬ 
mous letters that negro women had 
written to Mrs. Graves. If Mrs. 
Graves received the letters in ques¬ 
tion, is there any evidence that they 
wei'e written by negro women? White 
people are now and then accused of 
writ'ng anonymous letters. Only a 
short time ago a white woman, pres¬ 
ident of one of the women’s clubs in 
Chicago, was accused of writing anony¬ 
mous letters. If these letters were 
written by negroes, it is prima facie 
evidence that they were written by the 
base, ignorant element of the race. 

If the educated, high-toned negroes 
wished to reply to Mrs. Graves’ attack 
they would make use of the great dai¬ 
lies like the Times and Herald, so 
that the public could pass judgment 
on them. Mrs. James Vena’s reply to 
Mrs. Graves, published in the columns 
of the Herald, gave the latter far more 
annoyance than all of the anonymous 
letters the negroes will ever write. 

The Record says: 

“Not only have cowardly anonymous 
letter writers attacked Mrs. Graves,but 
‘The Liberator,’ a local weekly pub¬ 
lished by and for colored people, has 
contained some incendiary utterances 
calculated to stir up the blood of the 
blacks. Is it any wonder, then, that 
colored waiters and waitresses have 
of late been known to refuse to serve 
persons known to be opposed to ac¬ 
cepting their race on a social equal¬ 
ity?” 

If denouncing those as enemies of 
the peace and good order of this coun¬ 
try who are taking advantage of ev¬ 
ery opportunity to encourag lawless¬ 
ness, murder, brutality; if pleading for 
the supremacy of the law, equal rights 
and equal ^opportunity for all regard¬ 
less of color or previous condition is 
“incendiarism” “The Liberator” is in¬ 
cendiary to the core. The man who 
lends aid and comfort to the enemies 
of his country is himself an enemy of 
his country. We see mobs and the sym¬ 
pathizers of mobs in the samelight. The 


brute who assaults a woman is as bru¬ 
tal as the mob that burns him at the 
stake. Because a brute commits a 
crime, society is not benefitted by a 
whole community turning to brutes. 

In this country there can be no justi¬ 
fication of mob law. Mob law is an¬ 
archy and sooner or later those who 
justify it will be regarded and treat¬ 
ed as anarchists. We .shall wage an 
unrelenting warfare against mobs and 
their sympathizers, whether men or 
matter up, aside from their social lines, 
the American people ar divided into 
two great divisions. One is composed 
of those who love and labor for the 
p omotion of law, order and progress, 
who believe in granting every Amer¬ 
ican equality before the law, equality 
of opportunity and the adoption every¬ 
where of civilized methods. This class 
represents the virtue, intelligence and 
culture of the country, and is led by 
President .Roosevelt and Booker T. 
Washington. 

The other class is composed of those 
who oppose law, order and progress, 
anarchists who kill our presidents, 
those who make anarchists by encour¬ 
aging lawlessness, nullifiers, ballot 
thieves, political murderers, mobbers, 
those who burn human beings at the 
stake in the presence of their wives 
and children, then sell the baked flesh 
of their victims for the money there 
is in it. Think of it. selling 
baked human flesh for money; 
this class is lead by Senator 
T’llman and his cohorts, made up of 
men and women who are going over 
the country from one woman’s club to 
another stirring up strife between the 
races, justifying all that has been to 
impede the advancement of the ne¬ 
groes, encouraging race hate and sow¬ 
ing the seeds of revolution. 

If The Record chooses to be the Los 
Angeles mouth-piece of the Tillman 
gang, it is only a matter of taste. The 
Record is free. The Liberator will 
fight in the ranks of those who stand 
for law and order and equal opportu¬ 
nity for all. 

If this is incendiarism, the Tillman 
gang can make the best of it.

A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY. 

Florence, Ala., April 7. 

Simon Simpson, a colored man, was 
killed as a result of yesterday’s trag¬ 
edy at Tuscumbia. Simpson went into 


a butcher shop and began cursing all 
men who had participated in uie kill¬ 
ing, when he was ordered out by a 
white man named Walker. S.mpson 
refused to go and advanced on 
Walker, whom he struck over the 
head with a board, whereupon Walker 
seized a butcher knife and ham¬ 
strung Simpson in each leg, and cut 
off the thumb of his right hand. Simp¬ 
son bled to death. Walker surren¬ 
dered to tne authorities.

ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

In the popular voting contest held 
at the Azusa street church. Rev. Ed¬ 
wards was winner in the ministerial 
contest, receiving 945 votes. Rev. 
Donohoo, who gave him a close shave, 
received 937. Dr. Taylor, the most 
popular physician, and Miss Mattie 
Scott, the popular young lady. Rev. 
Nelson says he got more votes than 
any minister who was not running. 

If he had announced himself as a 
candidate he would have put a differ¬ 
ent face on the result. The contest 
was a profitable one for the church 
and made bushels of fun for the 
voters.

NEW WEEKLY PAPER. 

We had the pleasure of meeting Mr. 
Green, who will in a short time com¬ 
mence the publication of a weekly 
paper devoted to the advancement of 
the Afro-Americans. There is room 
here for a clean, up-to-date weekly of 
the kind in contemplation. Mr. Green 
is an old newspaper man and al¬ 
though he came here from Nashville, 
Tenn., he is a Mississippian, where 
he was connected with “The Senti¬ 
nel.” To run a negro newspaper in 
Mississippi requires pluck of a high 
order. Mr. Green is a practical print¬ 
er and has a plant of his own. He 
has The Liberator’s best wishes. 
-o- 

One of the state officers of the Af¬ 
ro-American League who resides in 
this city is trying to organize a secret 
political club to look after the negro’s 
interest during the coming campaign. 
This, of course, is naturally to he ex¬ 
pected, as none of the old gang will 
risk his business chances during the 
campaign by admitting that he Is a 
member of the League. Such an ad¬ 
mission puts the fellow under the 
ban of suspicion.

THE LIBERATOR. 


Shall Color be the Test 
of Womanhood ? 


Shall Woman’s Rights be 
Used to Crush 
Women? 

The battle that is raging over the col- 
or question between the white women 
of the different clubs composing the 
federation has not only side-tracked 
all other questions, but in some in¬ 
stances has almost reached the pugi¬ 
listic stage. 

To the colored women and other dis¬ 
interested spectators, the scrap is 
amusing, if not ridiculous. It is a 
case of building the steeple and letting 
the church go. The idea or an organ¬ 
ization having for its object the eleva¬ 
tion of womanhood attempting to 
make virtue, fitness and personal 
worth subordinate to the color of the 
skin is preposterous. 

But as absurd and un-Christian and 
un-American as the attempt is, it is 
just what the opponents of the admis¬ 
sion of colored delegates to the feder¬ 
ation are trying to do. That such a 
question should be entertained for a 
moment by a body of intelligent Chris¬ 
tian women, is strange. Isn’t virtuous 
womanhood, especially when enhanced 
by Christianity, broad enough to 
leave the highway to a nobler and 
purer womanly life open to all, regard¬ 
less of color? Shall the Christian sen¬ 
timent of this country surrender to 
jealousy and race prejudice? If the ele¬ 
vation of woman and the home is the 
object of women’s clubs, why is all 
this discussion about color? In spite 
of the studied evasion, these are the 
main questions involved in the pres¬ 
ent controversy and a frank discussion 
of them might give rise to some 
helpful reflections and put the Chris¬ 
tian white women of American in bet¬ 
ter light before the world. 

Do THE COLORED WOMEN desire 
admission into the federation of wom¬ 
en’s clubs? is a favorite question of the 
advocate of the color line. It is nat 
whether the colored women desire ad- 
mision, but whether the color of the 
skin shall be the test for admission in¬ 
to an organization which has for its 


object the general advancement of so¬ 
ciety by elevating womanhood. To 
make the color of the skin the test 
is to lower the standard of American 
womanhood. To this the colored wo¬ 
men are opposed. It makes woman¬ 
hood too cheap. Under such a test 
ony old thing whose color, not virtue 
comes up to the low standard would 
he a woman in the full sense of that 
significant term. Aside from this the 
colored women don’t care a snap. If 
virtue, intelligence and personal fit¬ 
ness is made the test the federation 
will have something to offer the young 
women of America and have some rea¬ 
son for existence. 

SOCIAL EQUALITY: Some of the 
reasons given by opponents of the ad¬ 
mission of colored delegates have been 
so flimsy that they would not be con¬ 
sidered serious in a “Lime Kiln Club.” 
Some consisted in wanton attacks upon 
the good name of the whole negro race, 
because, like the white race, some of 
them are bad. Some good Christ.an 
women so far forgot themselves as to 
justify and encouarge mob violence, 
burning at the stake on suspicion, 
murder, robbery, nullification and 
many other unlawful things that did 
not reflect credit upon themselves or 
the clubs upon whom they must have 
imposed. 

BUT THE PEAR OF SOCIAL 
EQUALITY, mixing of races, etc , is 
the straw that is breaking the camel’s 
back among nervous northern white 
women. But the southern women know 
that the races have already mixed and 
that social equality has existed be¬ 
tween the white men and negro women 
so long that it is difficult to distinguish 
a white person from a negro in tflu. 
South, especially in the larger cities 
and towns. If a man and woman who 
are raising a family of children as 
father and mother are not enjoying so¬ 
cial equality we would like to see a 
picture of social equality. If these 
good women really want to prevent the 
mixing of the races they are two hun¬ 
dred years too late. It is like one ad¬ 
vocating stringent laws against chicken 
thieves after he has stolen all of h.is 
neighbor’s chickens. 

CAN’T TELL A NEGRO FROM A 
WHITE MAN: The life of a railway 
conductor on Southern railroads in 
Southern states requiring separate cars 
for the races is one of trials and trib¬ 
ulations. In these states it is the duty 


of the conductor to keep the races sep¬ 
arate during the day at least. Now, 
to raise the question whether a dark 
skinned white man is a negro or not is 
to become the victim of a justifiable 
homicide. To put a blonde or brunette 
off the train because he or she refuses 
to leave the car set apart for negroes 
and the blonde or brunette thus ejected 
proves to be a negro and brings a 
damage suit against the railroad, the 
conductor is “up against” an unpleas- 
condition. 

TOO TRANSPARENT: Some of the 
reasons given by intelligent advocates 
of drawing the color line are so trans¬ 
parent as to raise the question of their 
seriousness. For instance, “I would be 
in favor of admitting the colored dele¬ 
gates if I was sure that .it would not 
bring about social equality and mix 
the races.” “It is but a step from the 
club to the drawing room,” etc. The 
above is a sample of the mechanical 
arguments adduced. In the light of 
surrounding circumstances they are 
transparent to say the least. In this 
state the white and colored people wor¬ 
ship in the same church, bow around 
the same sacramental altar, partaking 
of wine from the same cup, are bap¬ 
tized in the same pool, their chil¬ 
dren attend the same school, play to¬ 
gether on the same school grounds, sit 
together in the same theater, ride and 
seep in the same sleeping cars, bathe 
together in the same ocean, and die to 
sleep in the same cemetery. Yet with 
a black population of fifteen to twenty 
thousand and all this mixing there is 
less social equality and unholy mix¬ 
ing of the races in this state than there 
is in a single Mississippi town of 5000 
inhabitants with its separate schools, 
churches and graveyards. Now, if the 
admission of colored delegates to the 
federation will bring about social 
equality, why has not the co-education 
of the races brought it about in this 
state? If the admission of a half dozen 
colored women to the white clubs of 
this city will bring about social equal¬ 
ity, why has not the admission of hun¬ 
dreds of them to the white churches 
in this city brought it about? The at¬ 
tempt to lower the standard of Ameri¬ 
can womanhood is all that con¬ 
cerns us in this controversy. Men 
never rise higher than their ideals. 
They should therefore be lofty. The 
color line will be drawn in the federa¬ 
tion and by it the negro will lose 
noth/n^; more than what he loses in 
common with other American citizens.

Would N ot Be Lynched. 

Will Reynolds Cleans Up an 
.Alabama Mob. 

ANOTHER COLORED HERO ADDED 
TO THE CROWING LIST. 

Seven dead would-be lynchers, 21 
others with their bodies ripped and 
torn by Winchester bullets, the black¬ 
ened ruins of three or more cabins and 
the carcases of several dead horses, is 
Tuscumbia’s (Ala.) eloquent tribute of 
the memory of Mr. William Reynolds, 
the colored hero, who lynched a mob 
there on the 6th. Slowly but surely 
the negro is adopting a plan for the 
suppression of the mob that has never 
been known to fail—the cold steel cure. 
One negro with a Winchester and a de¬ 
termination to sell nis life as dear as 
possible, can prevent a mob of any 
number from lynching him. No ne¬ 
gro has failed who tried it. Mobs are 
always made up of cowardly cut¬ 
throats, who will fly at the first show 
of danger. 

THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE, 

The colored settlement near Tuscum- 
bia has been the scene of many out¬ 
rages committed upon the negroes who 
own all of the land in the settlement, 
by lawless poor whites, who upon one 
pretext or another, have made period¬ 
ical visits to the settlement, horse¬ 
whipping the negroes and otherwise 
maltreating them, “keeping the ‘nig¬ 
gers’ in their place,” as they term it. 
The negro who refuses to he whipped 
commits a capital crime, and is gen¬ 
erally arrested by the officers of the 
law and turned over to the mob, which 
hangs, burns or tortures him to death 
in whatever manner their savage in¬ 
stincts may suggest. Such crimes 
when committed upon negroes being 
no violation of the law of the country, 
since the negro is no longer property. 
Reynolds refused to be whipped, so 
the mob invoked the aid of the law 
to get him into their possession. In 
attempting to arrest Reynolds the 
sheriff was trying to turn him un¬ 
armed over to the mob. This Reynolds 
knew, and he treated him as he did 
the mob, of which the sheriff was a 
part. Reynolds taught them a whole¬ 
some lesson, one that will be long re¬ 
membered, one that is going to be 
imitated by other negroes in that mob- 
ridden section. The negro is getting 
over his fear of death and hell and is 
beginning to carry death, hell and 
damnation into the ranks of his per¬ 
secutors. The American people have 
surrendered the ten million negroes of 
this country to the mob and if the 
negro allows his throat to be cut with 
out making an effort to defend him¬ 
self, the country will continue to silent¬ 
ly approve. But if the negro will turn 
upon his assailants and cut some oif 
their throats while his is being cut, 
public sentiment will change front and 
a demand for the enforcement of the 
law will he made. Once make it cer¬ 


tain that some member or members of 
every mob will return home in a black 
box and the mob business will soon 
sleep in the grave with the lost cause. 
Charles, Lott and Edwards of Louisi¬ 
ana, Littlefield of Mississippi, Trice 
of Florida, Reynolds of Alabama, 
and others whose names we cannot 
recall, have set examples that if fol¬ 
lowed, and they will be, will put an 
end to the mob outrages that have made 
American civilization a stench in the 
nostrils of the world. In sections where 
to defend yourself against unlawful at¬ 
tack of lawless whites is a capital of¬ 
fense, as it is in Alabama and other 
Southern States, it is the duty of 
every negro to own a good Winchester 
rifle and when waited upon by a mob, 
whether it comes in tne capacity of of¬ 
ficers cr not. to make some member 
(f it bite the dust before he gives up 
the ghost. James Carter, who 
shot a white man at New Glas¬ 
gow, Va., was arrested, put in jail 
lill the mob got ready, then was taken 
out and hanged like a dog. If he 
treated the officers who arrested' him 
as Reynolds did he would hav-r d'.od 
like a man and took some of the mem¬ 
bers of the mot with him to the bur of 
eternal justice. The days of the mob 
aj’e numbered. “God helps them that 
lie.p themselves.” 

-o- 

REYNOLD’S VICTIMS. 

Sheriff Charles Gassaway (white) 
was shot through the arm and abdo¬ 
men. He is dead. Hugh Jones (white) 
shot through the head—dead. Bob 
Wallace (white) instantly killed. Will 
Gassaway (white) shot through the 
abdomen—dead; P. A. Prout (white), 
shot through the stomach—dead; Jes¬ 
se Davis (white), shot through the 

jaw—dead; -Payne (white), shot 

through the chest—dying; Robert 
Patterson (white), wounded in the 
leg; Jim Finney (white), wounded in 
the right shoulder. 

Don’t forget that all of this execu¬ 
tion was done by one lone negro, 
armed with a repeating rifle. No won¬ 
der the government has been using 
these kind of people in Juba and the 
Philippines. If one of these kind of 
men can put nine white men out of 
action, hold a company of militia the 
Wheeler Rifles, armed with one thou¬ 
sand rounds of ammunition—at bay 
until his own body was riddled with 
bullets and three buildings had been 
destroyed by fire in an effort to burn 
him out, what could he have done 
with the Spaniards, rour of whom 
were required to whip one American 
white man? 

While we regret the loss of life,still 
we admire the intreped bravery of this 
man, who will take his place among 
the heroes of the century. After he 
killed one man he knew what to ex¬ 
pect. It was either ignominious death 
by hanging or the stake. 

That he had nerve admits of no 
question. He had none of that 
squeamish fear that permeates the 


average colored citizen of the South¬ 
land today. He had no thought of the 
hereafter. He was in the living pres¬ 
ent. He believed no doubt that God 
would welcome a brave man rather 
than commend a coward. Nine men 
went down under his unerring aim. 
Seven white men joined him in the 
march to the other world. 


Mobs will be more careful .in Ala¬ 
bama hereafter. A few more of such 
colored men, and lynchings will go,
