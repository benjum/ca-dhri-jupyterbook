THE UBERATOR. 


The Record Opposed to 
Industrial Education 
of the Negro. 

Its Editor has a Severe Attack of 
Negrophobia. 

A Wail from the ‘lost Cause.” 

At the base of all the hubbub called 
the race problem is the steadily in¬ 
creasing disinclination of colored peupu. 
to do menial labor. Try as we will to 
shut our eyes to the truth, it is a labor 
problem at bottom. 

No sane white man or white woman 
has at heart any real fear that social 
equality of the races wall ever come 
about. The real thing which is objected 
to, and which is at hand, is industrial 
equality. 

The common idea is that this equality 
was conferred by the 14th amendment. 
It is not true. Industrial equality can¬ 
not be conferred by law. That can 
only give equality of opportunity. The 
freed slaves, spiritless and densely 
ignorant, were not transformed into 
skilled labor by legislation. Education 
was required and a cultivation of an 
understanding of the purposes and the 
dignity of labor. 

I he education has been generously 
lavished upon the negroes, at the ex¬ 
pense of the whites—yes, doubly at 
their expense, for the education has 
turned menial servants into industrial 
equals and competitors. 

No fact is more notable than that the 
first tendency of the half-educated negro 
is to seek the seemingly easy positions. 
Pay is a secondary consideration. He 
leaves the fields and the railroad grades 
and goes to the town to become a hotel 
porter or a barber. 

With a little education he instantly 
despises hard labor, and long to be in 
some brass button brigade. He has 
not been taught properly to appreciate 
the purpose and dignity of labor. The 
hereditary tendency to a life of ease 
and of display is still in him. One emi¬ 
nent, but harsh, southern sociologist has 
declared that the race needed another 
hundred years of slavery to drill that 
out of them. 

Southern newspapers report the con¬ 
tinual rise of an unwillingness among 
young colored women to do housework, 
since they "wish to be teachers/’ It 
is only another demonstration of the 
same tendency shown by the other six. 

The race problem, reduced to plain 
English, is the servant problem. In 
freeing and educating the negroes we 
have made them our industrial equals 
and deprived ourselves of a distinctive 
race that had performed our menial 
work. 


The situation came home in its full 
force when a little while ago in a 
southern city a crowd of striking union 
negroes fired upon a squad of white 
men who had gone to take their places. 
In leaping up to industrial equality the 
negro can ape the white man in more 
ways than one. 

The fault clearly lies in the kind of 
education given to the negro. He is 
given too much education of a wrong 
kind. His unchastened imagination . is 
stimulated, while no sterling qualities 
of character are drilled in him. He is 
given glimpses of the higher life and 
immediately seeks to gain it at a single 
bound, not being sufficiently taught that 
it is to be permanently attained only by 
slow, patient toil of hands and mind 
and heart. 

It requires immolation through many 
generations of servile toil and humble 
living to turn savage into man. The 
educators who seek to turn the negro 
into a gentleman by a course in college 
need to be educated themselves in some 
fundamental principles. 

No doubt they mean well and imagine 
they are doing the negro a great ser¬ 
vice in setting him to chasing the but¬ 
terflies of the industrial world. But 
they would do him an immeasurably 
better service were they to teach him 
the dignity and the chastening power 
of the common labor that his half-made 
nature can comprehend.—The Los An¬ 
geles Record. 

The writer of the above evidently set 
out with the intention to say some¬ 
thing “gin the nigger,” but every charge 
he brings against the negro, he unin- 
tentionly brings against the white man. 
What seems to trouble him, is that the 
negro with his half-made nature^ is suc¬ 
cessfully competing with the white man 
with his whole-made nature. So far as 
the "race problem” is concerned he hits 
the bull’s eye when he says: "The real 
thing which is objected to, and which 
is at hand, is industrial equality.” He 
says, that while the 14th Amendment 
confers upon the negro equality of op¬ 
portunity, it does not confer upon him 
industrial equality. 

If equality of opportunity does not 
carry with it unrestricted right to com- 
petion in all of the avenues of industry 
and trade, what does it mean? 

He admits, that the slave of forty 
years ago is not only the industrial 
equal, but a serious competitor of the 
white man with his centuries of free¬ 
dom and unrestricted opportunity. This 
speaks well for the negro. He sorrow¬ 
fully says, the negro leaves the fields 
and railroad grades and goes to town to 
become a hotel porter or a barber.” If 
we remember right the last named 
thades belonged originally to the negro. 
1^ is only of late years that white men 
adopted them and formed unions to 
crowd the negro out. “With a Htrie 
education, he despises hard labor,” he 
snvs. This is to be regretted, but we 
have known white men with a comnlpte 
education to show the same antipathy 


to hard labor and, before we forget it, 
we have known white men to leave 
the railroad grades to adopt the pro¬ 
fession of tramping, and some other 
very naughty trades. 

To our mind, it is no more criminal 
for the negro woman to want to become 
a teacher, than it is for a white wo¬ 
man, to want to become a teacher. If 
the southern newspaper editors presume 
that the educated negro woman is go¬ 
ing to cook for five dollars per month 
just because she is black, when she can 
earn $25 per month by teaching and 
dress making, etc., they are presuming 
too much upon her color. 

Those striking negro union men who 
fired upon non-union white men be¬ 
cause they wanted to work, simply 
imitated the white union strikers. If 
those negroes had been white men the 
Record would have hailed them as 
patriots for that lawless deed. In Illi¬ 
nois white strikers have frequently de¬ 
stroyed negro colonies, because they 
wanted to work. It was white strikers 
that mobbed a defenseless white woman 
for carrying her husband food while 
working to give his children bread. 
The only way to educate a race for 
menial service is to condemn it to per¬ 
petual slavery. Is that what the Rec¬ 
ord wants for the negro? 

We have advised the negroes all 
along to stay in the country, buy homes 
and educate their children, not for 
menials, but fit them to become lords 
of the land—that is the land they own. 
But any menial service is preferable to 
idleness. Better a thousand times live 
and die a menial than become a gentle¬ 
man burglar, a forger, counterfeiter, 
shop-lifter, foot-pad, thief, professional 
begger and tramp. To the credit of the 
negro the Record charges him _ with 
none of the above named improprieties, 
but gently upbraids him for wanting 
to better his condition by becoming a 
skilled laborer, for teaching school at 
$25 per month instead of cooking at $5 
per month, for wanting light jobs with 
big pay, such as editing one-cent even¬ 
ing papers, for laboring for a man’s 
money instead of holding him up, for 
receiving a check as a reward for hon¬ 
est toil instead of forging it, for leaving 
railroad grades to become hotel porters 
and barbers instead of tramping. 

Now we like the Record people and 
regret to see them training with the 
Tillman gang, but if we must, we will 
turn Baalam over to his asses.

JEALOUS WHITE GIRL. 

Kills Her Colored Rival in West Vir¬ 
ginia. 

Both in Love With a Colored Man- 
White Woman is Arrested by the 
Police. 

Parkersburg, W. Va., Nov. 14—Mabel 
Barnes, a white girl, lay in wait in a 
dark spot tonight for Perey Jones, a 
colored girl, attacked her with a knife 
and cut her throat, killing her almost 
instantly. 

The two girls were in love with a 
colored man, and jealously of the col¬ 
ored girl prompted the Barnes girl to 
commit the crime. The Barnes girl is 
under arrest.—Memphis Appeal. 

There will be no lynching, the negro 
girl is dead and the black bone of the 
contention took himself to the tall tim¬ 
ber, believing that there could be no 
harm in such a move. Reverse the case 
and the girl would be torturd to death 
in true Southern style. The truth is 
slowly coming to light. The author o f the 
miscegenation laws is the father of all 
the crimes resulting therefrom. It made 
the old rape dodge necessary and this 
dodge was used as a justification of 
mob law. , , 

Last year there were 1,846 marriages 
between whites and negroes in New 
York state. Nine hundred and twenty 
white men married negro women and 
928 white women married negro men. 

So far as the negro is concerned there 
is no rape ^racket in New York. There 
is no law in that state making the rape 
dodge necessary. See? 


“PAY RENT TO YOURSELF.” 
Noonday Meeting Held Yesterday at 
the Pacific Electric Shops by 
Francis Murphy. 

Francis Murphy held an enthusiastic 
meeting yesterday noon at the Pacific 
Electric Railway shops, where he had 
an audience of more than one hundred 
men. He admonished them to save their 
money now while times are so prosper¬ 
ous, to love their wives and make home 
happy. 

“Save _ your money,” he said, “and 
buy a little home of your own; stop 
paying rent to the other fellow, and 
pay rent to yourself.” 

The men were so well pleased with 
the talk of the veteran hero of the blue 
ribbon that they voted with a shout 
to have him come again, and he an¬ 
nounced another meeting at noon on 
November 24. On next Tuesday at the 
same hour he will talk at the Bishop 
Cracker Factory. 

The Murphy prayer meeting, which 
was held for the first time in the Art 
Room at Blanchard Hall, last Thursday 
evening, was attended by more than 
seventy people, and provision will be 
made for more people tomorrow even¬ 
ing in the same rooms. This meeting for 
more than a year was held from house 
to house until it entirely outgrew the 
accomodations.—The Times. 


We trust that our colored readers 
will read the above, paste it in their 
hats and govern themselves accordingly. 
Whatever is good for the white man is 
good for the negro. It is especially so 
in this case, as the negro has no mil¬ 
lionaire friend to give him employment 
he must save his earnings looking to a 
time when he can employ himself. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

HOTEL JONES has been re-opened 
in a new brick block. Everything is 
up-to-date. Jones needs no recom¬ 
mendation. 

* * * 

The habit of some cheap little negroes 
of speaking evil of every negro that is 
trying to do something for himself and 
race, is a vicious one and injures main¬ 
ly those negroes who possess it. Ev¬ 
ery stranger that comes to the city is 
given to understand which man needs 
watching, always marking men who 
stand for manhood and progress. How 
the fellow is to be pitied, who never 
speaks well of good men! We pray for 
these misguided men all the more, be¬ 
cause they are mainly ignorant young 
men who can read and write. Point 
out to the strangers the beautiful things 
about this great city. Tell them of o*r 
good people and their enterprises. They 
regard it as a good sign for you to be 
proud of your home and people.

It looks as if Doctor Geo. D. Taylor 
is going to take unto himself a better 
half. He purchased a lot recently in an 
aristocratic locality, and is preparing to 
erect a handsome residence. The doc¬ 
tor enjoys the confidence and best 
wishes of all who know him. Pie has 
a lucrative practice.

five acres of land at Sawtelle; price 
$1500, cash. Mr. Brooks made an ex¬ 
tensive trip through California last 
summer, and on his return home he 
spent some time in Southern California, 
visiting all points of interest around the 
city. He visited Sawtelle accompanied 
by Mr. and Mrs. L. L. Stewart, of 
Natchez, as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. 
Edmonds. He knows a good thing 
when he sees it. Sawetelle, the site of 
the National Soldiers’ Home, is situated 
14 miles from this city, and four miles 
from the ocean, is surrounded by tm- 
finest agricultural country on the globe. 
It is in the center of the immense bean 
fields that bids fair to surpass those of 
Ventura in extent, production and profit. 
Two railroads, steam and electric, con¬

OUR TICKET FOR 1904. 

For President of the United States, 
Theodore Roosevelt, of New York. 

For Vice-President, 

Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, of California, 
or 

Governor Durbin, of Indiana, 
DON’T LOOK UPON THE NEGRO 
AS INFERIOR. 

An editorial from the Record, pub¬ 
lished elsewhere in these columns, fur¬ 
nishes food thought. The attempt of 
certain whites to deny the negro his 
rights, to deny him the opportunity to 
develop himself along industrial, intel¬ 
lectual and other lines, is not made be¬ 
cause they regard him as an inferior, 
but because they believe him to be just 
opposite of what they claim. If this 
class really believed the negro to be 
inferior they would give him every op¬ 
portunity to prove it. If they believed 
what they preach they would open the 
doors of all of their societies for mental 
and moral culture to him as they have 
done to the Mexicans, Chinese, Japs 
and Indians. In every school or in¬ 


stitution for co-education of the races 
the negro receives more than his share 
o class honors. This can not be said 
of the others. Side by side the white 
man and the negro have fought all of 
the country’s battles, they furnished the 
labor and skill that has produced its 
great wealth. They furnished all the 
presidents, governors, jurists, senators 
and congressmen the nation has had. 
The eminent lawyers, soldiers, orators, 
doctors, scientists, inventors and fi¬ 
nanciers of the country have been either 
whites or negroes. The contest for su¬ 
premacy has been between them ancl 
them alone. Wherever the negro has 
had an even chance he has proven him¬ 
self to be the equal of the white man. 
The whole fight of his enemies now is 
to keep him from having an eqita. 
chance. This class of whites love the 
negro as a menial in spite of his black 
skin. Those whites who hate the negro 
worst as a man, loved him so well as 
a menial that they raise children by 
negro women, even if they had to kill 
the negro to do it. 

As a servant, they can swallow the 
negro, skin and all. This howl about 
the “race problem,” “negro inferiorry,” 
is a raw, base subtifuge and every now 
and then Tillman or some member of 
his gang admits the truth of it. Some¬ 
time ago ex-Gov. Northern, of Georgia, 
gave the lie to the whole gang in an in¬ 
terview. It is the negro's ability to gt». 
on in the world that they fear. Thev 
believe less in the inferiority of the 
negro than the negro does. 

If the negro’s faith in himself was 
as strong as these whites is, he would 
work winders. A man worthy of the 
name does not worry about his infer¬ 
iors except to give them a square deal. 
Only a coward will strike the fellow 
that’s down. 

The plea of the Tillman, Gorman, 
Vardaman, Carmack gang that ten mil¬ 
lion negroes, inferiors, created only to 
serve, must he disfranchised, chained 
hand and foot, to keep them from dom¬ 
inating sixty million white people, in¬ 
herently superior, created to rule, ought 
to he an insult to American manhood. 
The negro needs no class legislation to 
help him in the race. All he asks is 
the enforcement of the laws. He leaves 
the little matter of social equality and 
similar trifles to puzzle the brains of 
small white folks.

WANTS TO BE WHITE. 

From time to time we notice in the 
Richmond (Va. Planet and a few other 
negro papers, which advertises any thing 
that yields a revenue, the “Before and 
After” fraud, represented by cuts of 
kinky hair made straight and black 
skins made white, by certain recently 
discovered compounds. As these nos¬ 
trums are extensively advertised the ad¬ 
vertisers m_ist make money or they 
could not afford the expense. The fact 
that these fake skin-bleachers and halt 
straighteners are making money, shows 
that there are thousands and thousands 
of cheap negroes who would like to be 
white. 

This class of cheap, ignorant negroes, 
most of whom can read and write, be¬ 
lieve that man hood depends entirely 
upon the color of the skin and the 
texture of the hair. In other words 
they believe that a dark skin and kinky 
hair is proof of inferiority. This class 
is not only a disgrace but a detriment 
to their race. If they could be made 
white they would only increase the 
tramp gang. If tramp fraternity were 
negroes they too would be buy mg 
“skin bleach” and “anti kink.” But 
knowing as they do that without those 
virtues that constitute manhood, the 
color of the skin cuts little or no figure 
in the final wind up, they are trying to 
get even by committing burglary, high¬ 
way robbery, train wrecking, arson, kid¬ 
naping, loafing, begging and stealing. 
If the people of the “under world” j 
who constitute the ever increasing so- j 
cial evil were negroes they would also 
swell the demands for “skin bleach” 
and “anti-kink.” 

Our mail from time to time contains 
requests for space to advertise “skin 
bleach, anti kink,” and kindred frauds 
all of which find their way into the 
waste basket. We would not, if we 
could in any way change the pure, un¬ 
adulterated negro, believing him to be 
one of God’s masterpieces. As long as 
we see thousands and thousands of peo¬ 
ple of the so-called superior race in all 
stages of poverty, who are in the full 
enjoyment of unrestricted opportunity, 
we cannot but remain firm in our con¬ 
viction that superiority consists of some 
thing more than the color of the skin 
or the texture of the hair. The happi¬ 
ness that conies from doing good, that 
comes from living virtuous lives, is en¬ 
joyed only by those who do good and 
live virtuous lives without regard to 
race or colpr. 

To boil this matter down, if the ne- 
goes who are filling the coffers of these 
skin bleach fakers would spend that 
money for homes and race schools and 
churches and spend their idle moments 
in the cultivation of those virtues that 
make useful men and women, if they 
would love their race and support its 
enterprises, pay for and read race papers 
and entertain hatred for no race, but 
love for all, they would soon look 
about as well as other people. But the 


negro editors who allow their papers to 
be used as mediums to rob their race for 
sake of gain ought to cease their prat- 
ting about the equality of men, while 
they are teaching them that straight 
hair and a coat of white wash is lic^s- 
sary to make them equal.

ual Hall, John Mosee, M. G .Downey, 
Clarence Ward, Elzie Irvin and J. L. 
Edmonds Jr. are students at the Spring 
street night school. They work during 
the day and go to school at night. They 
belong to the class out of which the 
men of the future will come. Such 
pluck as they possessed surmounts all 
obstacles and never knows defeat. Such 
a desire for knowledge will not go un¬ 
rewarded. Knowledge thus acquired 
will make room for its possessor. The 
country is full of lost men, living dead 
men, who were sent to school, while its 
business is being conducted almost whol 
by men who went to school. Abraham 
Lncoln, Frederick Douglass, James A. 
Garfield and Booker T. Washington 
went to school. Lincoln went to school 
sax months. Douglass went to school 
to himself. Booker T. Washington 
walked several hundred miles to get 
there and then worked his way through. 
The way of self help starts out lowly, 
but it is the path the most illustrious 
have trodden. 


LYNCHERS MAY BE LYNCHED. 

The officers of the law at Lynchburg. 
Tenn.. have decided to protect the lives 
of white men and women in that little 
city and communitv by protecting those 
of the negroes. That is about the only 
way it can be done. Fourteen murder¬ 


ers who took part in lynching a negro 
at that place have been indicted and it 
is honed that the whole gang will get 
what they deserve. If the people of 
South Carolina had have adopted the 
same policy in dealing with its “nigger" 
killers Gonzales might have been spared. 
Thank God the South is waking up. 
The enforcement of the laws is her on/y 
hope. The man who will murder a 
negro will murder a white man. The 
jury that will acquit him in one case will 
acquit him in the other. Law or anarchy 
must reign. 


LECTURE ON THE LIFE OF MAR¬ 
TIN LUTHER. 

Attorney C. P. Lee’s lecture on “The 
Life and Times of Martin Luther,” de¬ 
livered before the Men’s Forum on the 
6th of this month, was the most elo¬ 
quent ever listened to by that body. His 
word pictures were so finely drawn, his 
description so vivid, his eloquence so 
fevid, his language so chaste, his words 
so simple and abundant. He car¬ 
ried his audience to the scenes 
where deeds of that great man’s life 
were performed. His audience saw 
things as he had seen them and felt as 
he had felt. They saw the rise and 
triumphal march of that great monk, 
as he defied the Pope, potentates and 
princes, and risked everything for the 
religious freedom of the human race. 
After silently looking upon the electri¬ 
fied audiences of that leader and lover 
of men, the Forum stood with uncover¬ 
ed heads in silence around his sacred 
tomb. Attorney Lee’s application of 
Luther’s life to the needs of the pres¬ 
ent was an inspiration. The lecture 
will be repeated. Ample notice will be 
given.
