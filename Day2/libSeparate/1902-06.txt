Hall Down Your Flag. 


A Flaming Lie. 


Lynching Must Stop. 


So long as men are executed in this 
country without the formality of trial, 
and without due process of law, the 
United States cannot, with truth, he 
called ‘The land of the free and the 
home of the brave.” 

Until the law of lynching is righted, 
until every man charged with crime 
is given a hearing before a jury of 
ihs peers, the flag that waves above us 
is too much like a flaming lie, and our 
boasted civilization has in it too much 
braggadocio. 

No matter who the criminal, or what 
the crime, there is but one way to in¬ 
flict punishment, and that is by the 
method laid down in the statute books 
of the land. 

W,e may be horrified at outrage and 
shocked by the doing of evil deeds by 
cruel and evil men, but nothing can 
be more shocking than have been the 
scenes of burning, hanging and shoot¬ 
ing that have disgraced the nation in 
more than one state of the American 
Union. And it is with unspeakable 
sorrow that The Times is compelled 
to admit that no section of the coun¬ 
try is entirely free from mese out¬ 
rages against the law of the land and 
against public decency and order. 

California lias had more than her 
share of lynching bees, and justice is 
clamoring for the punishment of the 
guilty in this regard, the while they 
go unwhipped thereof. 

We cannot ignore this monstrous 
state of affairs. And it is difficult for 
an American to look his fellow-men 
of other nations in the face so long as 
our courts are unable to convict. 

We may talk about the Philippine 
question, the tariff question, and the 
thousand and one other things that 
are the subject of consideration, but 
the burning question of the hour is 
the crime of lynching. It must be stop¬ 
ped, and the utmost authority of the 
several states and of the nation must 
be put forth to that enu. 

The matter has been tentatively 
touched upon in Congress; the move¬ 


ment must become general and vigor¬ 
ous. No true American wants to sub¬ 
mit to the reproach of other peoples. 
“Haul down your flag until it shall he 
made to mean in fact'what you claim 
it stands for!”—Times. 

-o—-- 

The Southern lynching season is 
started out with more than character¬ 
istic briskiness this summer. Con¬ 
gress, being stil in session, it might 
be worth the while of the national law T 
makers to look into the question a 
bit, with a view to making it possible 
for a man, even though criminal and 
vicious no end, to be permitted to live 
in these United States until a jury of 
his peers has sat on his case, and de¬ 
cided that he is ripe enough to hang. 
Picking negroes from the brusii and 
putting them into the burning is scar¬ 
cely proper in a land which boasts of 
its civilization, and bases its mode of 
civil and criminal procedure upon law 
and order. These few remarks are 
aimed directly at any part of the coun¬ 
try, North or South, where Judge 
Lynch holds court in continuous ses¬ 
sion, and issues his judgments by the 
rope or torch, and not by word of 
mouth. This lynching business ought 
to stop, and to must stop.—Times. 


THE PRESIDENT REBUKES THE 
MOB LYNCHING EVIL 


Is it only in the Army of the Phil¬ 
ippines that Americans sometimes do 
acts that cause the rest of America 
regret? (Cries of “Oh, no.”) From 
time to time there occurs in this coun¬ 
try, to the deep and lasting shame of 
our people, lynchings carried on un- 
edr circumstances of inhuman cruelty 
and barbarity—a cruelty infinitely 
worse than any that has ever been 
committed by our troops in the Phil¬ 
ippines; worse to the victims, and far 
more brutalizing to those guilty of it. 
The men who fail to condemn these 
lynchings, and yet clamor about what 
has been done in the Philippines, are 
indeed guilty of neglecting the beam 
in their own eye while taunting their 
brother about the mote in his. Under¬ 
stand me. These lynchings afford us 
no excuse for failure to stop cruelty 
in the Philippines. Every effort is be¬ 
ing made, and will he made, to mini¬ 
mize the chances of cruelty occurring. 

But keep in mind that these cruel¬ 


ties in the Philippines have been whol¬ 
ly exceptional, and have been shame¬ 
lessly exaggerated. We deeply and 
bitterly regret that any such cruelties 
should have been committed, no mat¬ 
ter how rarely, no matter under what 
provocation by American troops. But 
they afford far less justification for a 
general condemnation of our army 
than these lynchings afford for the 
condemnation of the communities in 
which they have taken plase. In each 
case it is well to condemn the deed, 
and it is well also to refrain from in¬ 
cluding both guilty and innocent in 
the same sweeping condemnation. 

In every community there are men 
who commit acts of well nigh incon- 
ceiveble horror and baseness. If we 
fix our eyes only upon these individu¬ 
als, and upon their acts, and if we for¬ 
get the far more numerous citizens of 
upright and honest life, and blind our¬ 
selves to their countless deeds of wis¬ 
dom and justice and philanthropy, it 
is easy enough to condemn the com¬ 
munity. There is not a city in this 
land which we could not thus condemn 
if we fixed our eyes purely upon its 
police record, and refused to look at 
what it had accomplished for decency 
and justice and charity. Yet this is 
exactly the attitude which has been 
taken by too many men. with refer¬ 
ence to our army in the Philippines, 
and it is an attitude both absurd and 
cruelly unjust.

“DARKEST UNITED -STATES.” 


BERLIN, June 14.—A pamphlet by 
Felix Baumann is having an extraor¬ 
dinary large circulation “In Dark¬ 
est United States,” and con¬ 
tains extravagant descriptions of the 
immorality alleged to exist in Amer¬ 
ican cities. There are long chapters 
on New York, Chicago, New Orleans 
and San Francisco. 

The writer has raked together ac¬ 
counts of cruel lynchings, police brib¬ 
eries and the sale of justice in cities. 
He contends that the United States is 
more deeply immoral than any other 
country in the world, and warns Ger¬ 
mans, especially women, against emi¬ 
grating to such an evil atmosphere. 
The black cover of the pamphlet is 
conspicuous on every news stand. The 
Stars and Stripes are emblazoned on 
it.

BURDETTE ON “LUCK.” 

“I believe that some people are born 
lucky and others unlucky. If a young 
man spends more money for neckties 
and yellow shoes than he does for 
books, he is very apt to be unlucky in 
his literary ventures. If a girl finds 
her rhymes in the ceiling and counts 
the measure of her lines on her finger 
tips, she will be unlucky when she 
tries to earn her living by writing po¬ 
etry. If a young man endeavors,stead- 
ily and persistently, to support him¬ 
self by playing ping-pong and billiards 
and wondering where he can borrow 
$5, he is liable to be unlucky in busi¬ 
ness. If a girl learns to dance by note, 
but is content to spell by ear, she will 
have hard luck keeping a place as 
stenorgapher, even in a place that 
spells socks ‘sox,’ and cigar ‘seegar.” 

“If a young man goes to hed at mid¬ 
night and breakfasts at 9 o’clock, I 
know he will have bad luck when he 
applies for cashier in the new bank. 
If a girl starts at 2:25 to catch the 2:20 
train I know she will have bad luck 
keeping her engagements. If a man 
forgets to put a stamp on his letter he 
is going to have bad luck with his cor¬ 
respondence. If it takes a woman 
half a minute to say her prayers ancl 
an hour and a half to dress, she may 
be a stunner on the street, but she 
will be a mighty poor Christian. If 
a young man buys his clothes on credit 
all the year, and has a running ac¬ 
count at every livery stable and res¬ 
taurant in town, he will be the un- 
Iuckiest man in California on Janu¬ 
ary 1. If a woman walks into a new 
building to see what the sign, “Dan¬ 
ger, Keep Out,” is put up for, she will 
be just lucky enough to have a hod 
full of mortar fall on her flower-gar¬ 
den-hat. If a young man ships a car¬ 
go of ice to the Klondike and a car¬ 
load of oranges to Riverside, he is 
handcuffed by bad luck in his specula¬ 
tions. 

“If a girl with a salary of $40 a 
month spends $20 for clothes, $ for 
board, $5 for amusements, and the rest 
for incidentals, she will come crying 
to you by-and-by to tell you that she 
is the unluckiest individual that ever 
lived. 

“In short, if you are lazy and shift¬ 
less and foolish and stupid and empty 
headed, you are born to bad luck, hard 
Juck, the worst kind of luck. An un¬ 


lucky person is simply a person who 
can’t be trusted, in religion, in busi¬ 
ness in politics. There is no mystery 
about bad luck. An unlucky person 
is simply a person who chooses to do 
unlucky things. 

“But if you get to the office a little 
before it is opened, aren’t afraid to 
dust your own desk, sweep out the 
store better than the porter, wear old 
clothes until you can pay for new ones, 
know more about the goods you are 
selling than yon do about the newest 
fad in vaudeville actresses, can’t tell 
Bob Fitzsimmons from the new 
soubrette, if daily you are finding out 
what you want to do ancl how to do 
it, you are born to good luck, and you 
can’t help it. It isn’t so very lucky 
to be bitten by a clog, but it’s deadly 
bad luck to keep a clog that bites you 
every time it sees you.”

WASHINGTON'S WORDS OF WIS¬ 
DOM. 


“It is always easy for a race to yield 
to the temptation of crushing and with 
holding opportunitnes from a weak 
rase—to be deceived by the false doc¬ 
trine that it lifts itself up in propor¬ 
tion as it keeps others clown. The cen¬ 
tral idea that I wish to impress is 
that this Nation will be strong in its 
citizenship just in proportion as, in 
its growth, it uplifts nearly ten mil¬ 
lions of black people. It will grow 
weak in proportion as it yields to the 
temptation of neglecting or degrading 
these people of African descent.” 

Thinking of the duty of his own 
race to itself, he said: 

“We must ever keep in mind that 
our future recognition is largely with¬ 
in our own hands. It is not what we 
say of good concerning ourselves, or 
what others may say of evil regard¬ 
ing us, that, in the long run, is going 
to hinder or help us. It is going to be 
what we actually accomplish. By our 
fruits men will judge us. As a race 
we must learn not to be deceived or 
discouraged by the superficial or tem¬ 
porary. The real question with us as 
a race is whether each year we are 
gaining in property, intelligence, high 
character, and in the confidence ancl 
respect of our neighbors, black and 
white. It is the quiet, persistent, eter¬ 
nal, unostentatious effort to prove 
our worthiness that is going to win, 


With the Negro it will be as with the 
white man. He will weaken himself 
ancl degrade his soul if he permits 
race hatred to control or guide him. 
Love for all men and hatred for none 
must be the mainspring of life.” — 
Western Christian Advocate. 

-Q- 

AN UNCROWNED QUEEN. 


The Negro woman is indeed an un¬ 
crowned queen in adversity, and lifts 
her head as far above abuse, slander 
and insult as the lofty mountains kiss¬ 
ed by the pure airs of heaven, tower 
above the swamps and marshes which 
lie at their base. 

Our female element, under mother 
ii tUience, attends school ancl church, 
e& thews the brothels, stays at home 
an 1 works, and, to our shame, is the 
bat kb one of the Negro race today. 

Were it not for the Negro woman, 
the outlook would be dark. I am 
aware of the breadth of my speech 
when I say that the world has never 
furnished a higher womanhood under 
like conditions than (lie Negro woman 
of the South. With strong appetites 
and passions, penniless, often house¬ 
less, practically left to shift alone, 
amid debasing influences in the race 
and out, exposed everywhere, stumb¬ 
ling, falling, rising, fleeing—she goes 
on, washing, cooking, plowing, sow¬ 
ing, reaping—educating her children, 
building the cottage, erecting churches 
and schools—often supporting hus¬ 
band and son—this black woman de¬ 
serves the admiration of the whole 
world.—W. H. Council. From Pacific 
Coast Appeal. 

-—o- 

Those who are studying the Negro 
problem ought to go ancl look over the 
situation in Jamaica. It would give 
them great light upon the pathway. 
The Jamaica slaves received their free¬ 
dom in 1838. Today, many, if not 
most of the leading merchants, trades¬ 
men, postoffice and minor railroad of¬ 
ficials, conductors and motormen, en¬ 
gineers, -civil engineers, and teachers 
in graded schools are men in whose 
veins runs colored blood. They are 
in the main agreeable and well in¬ 
formed, ancl many of them are edu¬ 
cated and refined. The tradesmen and 
conductors are more courteous and 
considerate than the majority of those 
of white skin occupying similar posi¬ 
tions in America. A few weeks in Ja¬ 
maica will convince the most skepti¬ 
cal that the colored man is capable of 
development through educational me¬ 
thods.—Ella Wheeler Wilcox,

THE PRESIDENT RET ALIA 1 ES. 


Elsewhere in this edition will be 
found the President’s forceful casti¬ 
gation of the mob and its pro¬ 
moters. But the cause called 
forth the President’s scathing 
rebuke detracts much from its value 
as an appeal to the law and order ele¬ 
ment of the country. To attract the 
attention of the world from the un¬ 
speakable atrocities perpetrated upon 
colored American citizens in the South, 
by lawless whites, Senators Tillman 
and Carmack have raised a great howl 
about atrocities practiced upon the Fil¬ 
ipinos by our soldiers. The constant 
howl of these mob leaders, Tillman 
and Carmack, about outrages by the 
army in the Philippines goaded the 
President into retaliating, hence his 
speech denouncing mob violence in 
this country. He says in effect to Till¬ 
man and Carmack, “When the people 
whom you represent and for whom you 
speak stop burning negroes at the 
stake and torturing them in a manner 


that savages would not permit, the 
army of which I am chief will cease 
to imitate you and* your followers in 
the Philippines.” He did not speak as 
one having authority. As the head of 
a great nation he did not demand the 
enforcement of its constitution and 
laws. It puts him in the attitude of 
saying, “If you speak against lawless¬ 
ness in the army, I will speak against 
it at home. If your mobs let the army 
alone,I will let you alone." The presi¬ 
dent’s chair has had a weakening ef- 
lect on its occupants in recent years. 
Men who are governors of states or¬ 
dered mobs shot down,bowed to mobs 
as president. Unless the President 
changes his method of attack he will 
never command the respect of the mob. 
Through Tillman and Carmack themob 
will still tantalize him. 

•-o- 

THE TIMES. 

The position of the Los Angeles 
Times on the lynching evil is sound 
and 1 patriotic. The strong appeal of 
the Times to the national government 
to take a hand in this matter, look¬ 
ing to a stop of these disgraceful oc¬ 
currences shows a love of country and 
a determination to defend its honor, 
regardless of the feelings of a vicious 
public sentiment. Of course it is only 
negroes that is being burned alive and 
shot and hung like brutes and the out¬ 
spoken manner of the Times against 
these outrages upon defenseless 
colored American citizens, when 
compared with the silence or 
equivocation of too many of the 
other papers, does not prove 
that its brave editor loves the negro 
any better than they, but loves his 
country more. The every report of 
shooting and hanging of negroes by 
mobs and periodical burnings at the 
stake with slow fires in the presence 
of women and children, then auction¬ 
ing off the charred flesh for souvenirs 
must make this nation appear in eyes 
of foreigners as a gigantic mob. And 
that is not all, unless this thing is 
stopped it is only a question of time 
when the mob will dominate what is 
left of the country. Truly the great¬ 
est question before the American peo¬ 
ple today is the lynching question. 
Either the laws will have to protect 
all of the people or they will protect 
none of the people. 


GOV. GAGE WILL BE RENOMIN¬ 
ATED. 

The renomination of Gov. Gage is 
now conceded. The great body of 
voters believe him to be honest and 
sincere and the fight that is being 
made upon him by Spreckels, De 
Y-oung et al, will only bring him in 
closer touch with the people. 


Ex-Rev. Kelley, whose penchant for 
honey-fugling around weak-minded 
women, when the men are at work, 
was held under a $2000 bond to answer 
in the superior court of San Fran¬ 
cisco for seduction. He made a prop¬ 
osition to marry the girl to escape the 
pen, but she indignantly refused. 
Having failed in the matrimonial 
proposition he may set up the “Breck- 
enridge” plea. It is difficult to esti¬ 
mate the moral injury that an idle 
immoral minister can inflict upon a 
community. Imagine an idle, immoral, 
well-fed minister with a salary of $100 
a month running around loose among 
the thoughtless young church women! 

-o- 

A MOTHER’S AWFUL DEED. 

In a fit of insanity a Mississippi 
white woman killed her six children 
and set her home on fire on the 15th 
It was a sad tragedy. If the truth was 
known that unfortunate woman may 
have witnessed the cruel lynching of 
some negro or heard some one, pos¬ 
sibly a relative tell of the gallant part 
he played in a burning at the stake. 
She bound her four-months-old baby 
to the bed post and burned it alive. 
It is an incident worthy of note, that 
for every negro burned at the stake, 
15 to 20 white persons lose their lives 
in accidental fires, being in most cases 
cremated alive. 

---o--- 

MARRIED A WHITE WOMAN. 
The recent announcement that a 
colored brother had taken unto him¬ 
self a white wife caused great excite¬ 
ment among the colored population 
and brought forth a hurricane of un¬ 
favorable comment. If the white peo¬ 
ple were as bitterly opposed to the 
mixing of the races as the Negroes 
are, the mul-a^o crop wouldn’t be 
worth gathering. This is another 
case in which the white man is the ag¬ 
gressor, with now and then a white 
woman who retaliates by fastening on 
to a black spouse. Not satisfied with 
taking all of our handsome maidens, 
they have commenced taking our men. 
It is just awful!

THE MAN WITH THE PI, CHFORK. 


Two forces met, there was a crash; 

But Southern weapons did not clash. 
With open hands and fists they tore; 
But still there was no loss of gore. 

It seems an unsolved mystery 
That dignified old chivalry. 

Which always hoasts of honor bright, 
Engaged in a plebian fight. 

The pitchfork knight, so full of ire. 
Opens indiscriminate fire; 

His hatred, like an evil spell. 

Is always raising strife and h—I. 

This fire-eater from the South 
Finds it hard to shut his mouth; 

He’s learned to*iise his pitchfork well. 
And he delights to raise a h—I. 

But the time is drawing nigh 
When he must lay his pitchfork by; 

He cannot take it Over There; 

He’ll be obliged to leave it here. 

From heaven’s gate he will be spurned, 
Because he wanted Negroes burned; 
He’ll find his unrelenting hate 
Will surely meet the sinner’s fate. 

It’s hoped that when his pitchfork’s 
gone 

He’ll sink into oblivion; 

There, where no Negroes will be 
lynched. 

But where all the pitchfork knights 
are singed. 

Old Pitchfork Knight, forewell, fare¬ 
well! 

You’ll go where darkened spirits dwell. 
O’er there on night’s Plutonian shore, 
Where pitchforks will be used no more.

GOOD BOOKS. 

What a beautiful world this is to 
one who enjoys the companionship of 
good books. To him there is nothing 
useless, nothing homely, nothing hope- 
lesdly bad. In the darkest hours of 
the night the mental vision remains 
bright. Books bring the past and the 
present into each others embrace. 
Through their medium we stand 
in the presence of the people of long 
ago, sharing their joys and sorrows, 
their hopes and fears. We hear Abra¬ 
ham say to Lot ‘‘Let there be no strife 
betwixt me and thee.” We see the 
mother of Moses put him in the ark 
of bull rushes and place the precious 
cargo in the Nile. We gaze in silent 
admiration as the mighty army of 
Cambyses passes by and think al¬ 
though these gallant hoys will change 
the geography of the world, many of 


them will not pass in grand review 
when the conquering army returns. 

We witness the battle between 
Caesar and Pompey. The sad fate of 
the latter arouses our keenest sym¬ 
pathy. What a lesson it teaches! 
How transitory is human power and 
greatness! Only turn the musty 
pages of those silent old books called 
histories,, and a long train of nations, 
statesmen, warriors, orators, pass in 
grand review. Who could be idle or 
lonesome in the presence of such an 
animated scene? If it were not for 
books, perpetual darkness would cover 
all the historic past and the benefits 
we derive from a knowledge of man’s 
struggles and achievements from the 
dawn of his existence to the present 
would sleep with him in voiceless sil¬ 
ence. Books, like the deeds of the de¬ 
fenders of human rights, are monu¬ 
ments that time can not pulverize— 
stones of everlasting remembrance. 
Good books are friends that you can 
not bore; they always receive you gra¬ 
ciously and give freely the best they 
have in store. They purify the soul 
and inspire it with lofty aims. While 
shutting you in from the vulgar and 
the vicious, they extend your horizon 
and broaden your sphere of usefulness. 
In the presence of the noisy, gossip¬ 
ping multitude they enable you to hold 
communion with and enjoy the com¬ 
panionship of the brightest minds of 
all ages. You walk, as it were,through 
the open door into the pres¬ 
ence of authors, poets, philosophers, 
orators and statesmen and receive from 
their lips treasures of wisdom gather¬ 
ed by a life time of laborious self-sac- 
raficing researches. A knowledge of 
books lends a charm to the barren 
landscaps, an angel peeps from every 
stone, every tree an object of study 
and companionship, gives speech to ev¬ 
ery flower and the passing brook sings 
an inspiring song as it journeys on to 
the ocean, scattering blessings with an 
ever increasing abundance. 

The young man who early cultivates 
a taste for reading pure literature will 
become an educated man whether he 
attends college or not and will have 
power and influence in his commun¬ 
ity, whether it is cultured or rustic. 
Books are cheap. A few good ones 
well read will give weight to your 
opinion, and before you know it your 
influence will be in demand. Have a 
good book always handy, give it only 


your spare moments, that is the time 
you spend in idleness or worse—stand¬ 
ing on street corners listening to fool¬ 
ish talkers— do this, and time will do 
the rest.

WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH 
TEXAS? 

Was the negroes in Texas freed by 
immortal Lincoln or some one else? 
If Lincoln freed these people why do 
they celebrate the 19th of June as 
emancipation day? For the land’s 
sake somebody ought to set these peo¬ 
ple right in this matter. Every year 
about this time a ye.,ow circular em¬ 
anates from the Eagle’s nest announc¬ 
ing a great celebration. This ciVcu’ar 
usually contains the names of every 
minister in town,generally mis-spelled 
and the name sf every colored person 
that can be found on the great 
register. This is done without the 
knowledge or consent of the parties 
whose names are used, and done 
to induce feeble-minded men and wo¬ 
men to quit work and loaf around 
some park and eat stale refreshments 
so that seme fellow can get a rake off. 
How the ministers can allow their 
names to be misspelled and thrown 
around- in the rubbish is hard to un¬ 
derstand. Have you seen the ‘ast cir¬ 
cular? Like its predecessors, it is 
noticeable only for its independent 
orthography and lawless phraseology. 
Only the fact that the Eagle man is 
trying to poise as a leader caused The 
Liberator to notice this matter. We 
are measured by our leaders. We 
would not be surprised to find the 
names of some colored preachers on 
a prize fight committee. Holy fathers, 
your names are getting nrghty com¬ 
mon! The old “finance committee” is 
not dead. The last quit work Eagle 
circular can he found at the park 
museum.

Messrs. Smith and Lewis, the enter¬ 
prising dealers in stoves, have opened 
a branch house at Avalon, Catalina Is¬ 
land. They are doing a prosperous 
business in both stores. They carry 
the largest lot of gasoline hot plates 
in the city. 

Mr. T. B. Walker, the Pasadena con¬ 
fectioner, has sold out. 

The brother of Dr. A. C. Garrot has 
settled in the city. He is studying med¬ 
icine. Being a cultured young man, 
he is a valuable addition to our social 
circle. 

Mr. C. W. Holden attended the Ma¬ 
sonic grand lodge, which convened at 
Marysville. He reports an interesting 
session. The grand lo'dge was royally 
entertained by all classes of citizens, 
and a general good time was had. 

The campaign will soon be open. 
Look out, for colored campaign buf¬ 
foon will be in evidence with his char¬ 
acteristic speech. The negro who 
quits his work to do politics will be 
overlooked when the time comes to 
give out spitoon jobs. 


Mr. Harpier of Pasadena, has pur¬ 
chased 1 a neat two story building near 
the Salt Lake railroad station. This

The rally for the pastor’s salary 
given at the Wesley Chapel M. E. 
church on the 15th, resulted in rais¬ 
ing $80 and still there are omer mem¬ 
bers to hear from. The amount will 
reach $100 when the checks are all in. 
The members of this church have a 
minister of which they are justly 
proud. Rev. and Mrs. Donohoo have 
been a blessing to the community. 

-— -o- 

It is better to raise cabbages in your 
front yard than weeds. The crop of 
a kind heart is good deeds. 

If the Replblican party cannot pro¬ 


tect the Negro in the enjoyment of his 
constitutional rights, when it is in his 
power, it could serve him better in re¬ 
tirement, as it would then have time 
to agitate. The wrongs of the Negro 
enlists much sympathy from the G. 
O. P. when it is out of power. It 
wouldn’t be a bad thing if the party 
could get into a sympathetic mood. 

-o-- 

If your brother gains a little notor¬ 
iety by trying to do good, don’t let it 
arouse envy; let him have your en¬ 
dorsement. You cannot elevate your¬ 


self by finding fault with others. If 
you can’t put your shoulder to the 
wheel, don’t try to pull the other fel¬ 
low’s away. It is not the fault finder, 
but the one who sets examples, that 
leads the multitude. 

■-o- 

If the Negro would do less dabbling 
in politics and more in business, he 
would have more influence in his com¬ 
munity. Every time you earn 50 cents 
doing politics, you can make $2 doing 
business. It is a sad thing to see a 
homeless man doing politics.
