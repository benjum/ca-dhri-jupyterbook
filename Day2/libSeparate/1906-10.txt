WHY THE NEGRO SHOULD VOTE THE WHOLE PROHIBITION TICKET. 

PLANK IV. 

Because this is a part of their platform: “We condemn the numerous 
shameful, cowardly and indefensible assaults of mobs upon the Colored 
race.” 

Because when we consider the present status of our body politic it must 
be done with grave apprehension. The spirit of Anarchy, of all forms of 
lawlessness which seems to have a firm grip on the Nation, makes it im¬ 
perative for thd Colored voter to co-operate with that party which stands for 
the enforcement of law as well as equal ciyil and political rights to all. The 
above plank from the Prohibition Party platform indicates the position of 
that party with reference to mob violence and should appeal to every lover 
of human rights. 

Because they believe in the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of 

God. 

Because contrary to our present status with other parties we have all 
to gain and nothing to lose. 

Because the Prohibition party of Los Angeles has recognized the Negro’s 
political rights by nominating Theo. W. Troy for County Auditor and Attor¬ 
ney Chas. S. Darden for Police Justice, both of which nominations are repre¬ 
sentative and honorable. It is our imperative duty to support the party 
that thus recognizes our rights. Let us be grateful for this recognition. 

Because they have given us the square deal by the above recognition.

THE LIBERATOR. 


A Day of Retribution 
Coming. 

The atrocities committed by the 
hellish fiends who composed the mobs 
at Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 22d, 23rd, 1906, 
were but the logical result of the 
inflammatory utterances which for 
several months past have appeared in 
the public press of Georgia, and had 
for its apex the charge, under flaming 
headlines, that numerous attempts 
had recently been made by negroes 
upon white women in Atlanta, Ga. 
That these and other utterances rel- 
. a tive thereto have called from the 
press of Georgia a mild protest is a 
tacit acknowledgment that the accusa¬ 
tions were a libel on the negro race, 
had no basis of fact and is but a link 
in the chain of circumstances which 
the Southern white man has forged 
for the purpose of creating public sen¬ 
timent against a struggling race, 
whose, rapid and material advance¬ 
ment in the face of every opposition 
has but aroused within the Anglo- 
Saxon all the evil passions of the hu¬ 
man brute. 

After all has been said as to the 
causes for the lamentable conditions 
which prevail all through the south¬ 
land, lamentable not more for the ne¬ 
gro than for the white man, for his 
brutish treatment of the negro is 
sure to act as a boomerang upon him¬ 
self—after all the theorists have ex¬ 
ploited their fallacies, the cold, un¬ 
varnished, unpleasant truth is that 
Theo. Roosevelt, the fountain head 
of our National Government, is direct¬ 
ly responsible for each and every out¬ 
rage which has for its inception racial 
prejudice. Elected upon a platform 
upon which he has not had the man¬ 
hood to put the weight of hfs iniluenc 
for the enactment of laws which em 
bodied the principles advocated by 
that platform, he has sat supinely idle 
and by his indifference gave license 
to the murder of men to whose patriot¬ 
ism and bravery he is indebted' for 
the august privilege which he now 
abuses. In vain we have listened for 
a single protest from our idolized 
President, whose acquiescent silence 
can be charged to the strain of Souh- 
ern blood of which he so proudly 
boasts. Prom the pedestal upon which 
he stands, an heroic figure, as the dic¬ 
tator of the policy of the Republican 
’'crtv. he has^ not shaped, permitted 
the introduction or influenced for pass¬ 
age one iota of legislation which had 
for its purpose the protection of more 
than 10,000,000 of his most loyal con¬ 
stituents from the brutality of organ¬ 
ized bodies of fiends who would make 
the demons of hell blush for shame. 

It may be a waste of words to re¬ 
mind the Anglo-Saxon, so dead does 
he seem to all sense of justice, when 
a black face is before the bar of pub¬ 
lic opinion, that this race has not fit 


yet given birth to an anarchist, neither 
has he thus far given evidence that 
the wrongs he has suffered have en¬ 
gendered within him the sentiment 
which culminates in the assassination 
of our presidents. It remains to be 
seen if the brutish unreasoning preju¬ 
dice of the white man will not in time 
arouse in the breasts of this long suf¬ 
fering race a spirit of revenge which 
will culminate in such acts of reprisal 
as shall strike terror to the hearts of 
all those who trample under foot every 
sentiment of humanity and fair deal¬ 
ing. 

Russia has her nihilists, Italy has 
her Maffia, England her Fenians, and 
America could profit by the example 
which history furnishes of the con¬ 
duct of a persecuted people when they 
awake from their porfound slumber of 
timidity and indifference and break 
from their limbs the shackles of the 
oppressor. 

The worm can turn.

it knew it was false. And to circulate 
a known falsehood without branding it 
as such is to become a party to the lie 
so circulated. What the white press 
of this country hopes to gain by sys¬ 
tematically circulating lies to stir up 
strife between American citizens U 
hard to understand, except it be that 
the love of money has torn from the 
bosoms of the white Americans every 
vestige of patriotism. If there is 
money in it, no lie is too base for the 
average white paper to circulate. 


ANOTHER LIAR TO THE RESCUE. 

LYNCHING RECORD. 

MANY NEGROES KILLED. 

(By the Associated Press—A.M.) 

New York, Sept. 24.—The World to¬ 
day prints a statistical story which 
avers that 4000 persons have been put 
to death without warrant of law in the 
United States in the last 25 years. 
Ninety-five per cent of them, it de¬ 
clares, were negroes, charged with as¬ 
saults on white women. 

The statement in the above that 
ninety-five per cent of the 4000 Amer¬ 
ican citizens foully murdered by mobs 
in this country in the last 25 years were 
negroes charged with assault upon 
white women is a base lie out of whole 
cloth. It is an infamous libel upon a 
struggling race that is down, and be¬ 
cause it is down. This oft-told lie is 
the common property of every apol¬ 
ogist of mob murder. 

President Roosevelt says only 25 
per cent of the persons lynched were 
charged with crimes against the wo¬ 
men of the country. Replying to Gov. 
Jeff Davis’ endorsement of mob law. 
President Roosevelt turned to him and 
said: 

Now, to avenge one hideous crime 
by another is to reduce the avenger to 
the bestial level. Another thing which 
makes this lynch law abhorrent is that 
three-fourths of the crimes for which 
it is invoked are for others than that 
against the woman of the country. 
Governor, you and I and all others in 
authority owe it to our people to drive 
out the reproach and menace of lynch 
law in the United States.” 

According to the above, which is 
true, only 1000 of the 4000 persons 
murdered by mobs were charged with 
assault and how many of them were 
victims of conspiracies will never be 
known. 

The World knew, if it knows any¬ 
thing, that its statement quoted above 
was false and every paper that copied 


Bishop Turner on Whisky-Drinking 
Preachers. 

We beg no pardon for being severe 
on the ministerial whisky sot, but 
when we are charged with giving tol¬ 
eration to other crimes, to the excep 
tion of the whisky drinking, they ma¬ 
liciously lie. But from here to the 
grave we expect to kill every man who 
drinks whisky in our dominion. The 
Negro has but little sense at best, and 
if he has not sense enough to keep 
sober, he is an inexcusable fool and 
merits ecclesiastical death. We had 
rather hear a hog grunt than to listen 
to the babble of a liquor-drinking 
preacher, and every bishop of the A. 
M. E. church who will condone a 
liquor-drinking preacher and still al¬ 
low him to proceed in the face of such 
a crime verified, is no more fit to 
preach than the whisky-drinking vic¬ 
tim. 


Rev. L. G. Jordan, Corresponding 
Secretary of the National Afro-Ameri¬ 
can Council, is calling for help in or¬ 
der to fight the battle of the race in 
the matter of oppression and racia 1 
discriminations. He asks that the do¬ 
nations for this purpose be sent to the 
One Cent Savings Bank, Nashville, 
Tenn., J. C. Napier, Cashier. He is 
also calling upon the colored people 
to offer prayer, Sunday, October 7th, 
for the betterment of our condition. 
The cause is a worthy one and should 
be supported. Bishop A. Walters is at 
the head of the movement.—Richmond 
Planet. 


It Is Coming; the Times Demand It. 

If Gov. Joseph Polk of Missouri is 
a true prophet the morning of a new 
and brighter day of political and civic 
righteousness will very soon begin to 
dawn. He said in a recent speech: 

“We are in thi beginning of the 
greatest moral awakening America has 
ever known. The next four years will 
be distinguished as the'time in which 
the reign of lawlessness and privilege 
.ends and the reign of equal rights for 
all will berome fixed in national poli¬ 
cies and the conscience of mankind. 
The fact thet this awakening against 
wrong has come at a time when pros¬ 
perity is at hand, shows it does not 
proceed from a spirit of discontent but 
springs from the moral sense of the 
people. We are entering upon the 
best age the world has known.

Hr. Theo. W. Troy, 
Prohibition Candidate for 


County Auditor. 

, Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 1. 

Ed. Liberator: 

Dear Sir: I have never been and 
never expect to be a politician, but 
try to be a plain, conscientious voter. 
What I say here is not for any per¬ 
sonal benefit, but I feel it to be my 
dn,ty to let my friends know where I 
stand. 

We are fast learning to help those 
who help us. When a party recog¬ 
nizes one of us, it helps the whole 
race, and just now the Prohibition 
party has given us recognition by plac¬ 
ing on its ticket Mr. T. W. Troy. This 
party is to be congratulated in their 
selection of Mr. Troy, for he is a man 
of good standing and well worthy of 
the place accorded him. 

The Prohibition party is the only 
party with backbone enough to give 
us recognition, and now it is the duty 
of every colored voter to rally to the 
support of that party. 

T believe, in all local affairs, that 
the colored voter should remain inde¬ 
pendent, always voting for the best 
interest of the colored man. 

Yours very truly. 

A. C. GARROTT. 


The Forum’s Committee Makes Report 
Having an intrinsic patriotic affec¬ 
tion for our native land, and wishing 
to see its present pernicious condition 
ameliorated, we, after careful invest!- 
—^;on, are of the opinion that the mo- 
e prompting the dastardly crh.iGh 
perpetrated by the Atlanta mob in the 
massacre of twenty-five or more inno¬ 
cent negroes were deliberate, cold¬ 
blooded murders. 


The excuse offered for this deliber¬ 
ately planned horror was that a num¬ 
ber of negroes had committed assaults 
upon white women. We herein de¬ 
clare the crime of assault to he in no 
greater degree prevalent among the 
blacks than among the whites, and 
upon this fact we invite investigation, 
fhe most malicious type of yellow 
journalism seems indigenous to the 
Southern soil, and in the city of At¬ 
lanta flourishes under most favorable 
conditions. 

Sensational utterances from one yel¬ 
low journal against the negro, encour¬ 
ages other papers of like color to more 
alarming sensations in order to earn 
the applause of the rabble. 

The thousands of youths of the city 
whose minds had become poisoned and 
inflamed by these yellow papers, not 
content with their murderous work, be¬ 
came the wanton destroyers of prop¬ 
erty. For these irresponsibles we offer 
our pity, our prayer. 

We further denounce the humiliat¬ 
ing arrests of our citizens charged 
with having arms and ammunition to 
protect their homes from the assault 
of cowardly murderers. These crim¬ 
inal depredations can add no bright 
pages to American history, neither can 
they add respect to American citizen¬ 
ship. We believe a government that 
has denounced mob violence in Russia 
and uses its military arm to stop blood¬ 
shed in Cuba can undoubtedly, if it so 
desired, stop such outrages at home.

THEO. D. TROY,

THAT ATLANTA MASSACRE. 

The wholesale, cold-blooded butchery 
of unarmed colored citizens charged 
with no crimes, by bloodthirsty white 
men and boys in Atlanta, Ga., on Sept. 
22d, is an outrage, so cowardly and 
revolting that it places the perpetrat¬ 
ors in the lowest ranks of savagery. 
That the massacre had been deliber¬ 
ately planned is shown upon its face. 
And to add to the heinousness of that 
awful outrage, the white citizens of 
Atlanta in mass meeting admit that 
the assault charges were false, and de¬ 
manded that their daily papers pub¬ 
lish no more stories of assaults until 
they have-been proven true and that 
no more extras be issued, proving con¬ 
clusively that the papers were respon¬ 
sible for that cowardly slaughter of a 
score of innocent black men and the 
wanton destruction of thousands of 
dollars’ worth of property. All things 
considered, the Atlanta outrage is the 
most diabolical ever perpetrated in 
this country. Think of it. Atlanta is 
'the chief city in the State of Georgia— 
the seat of government of that state, 
the home of the Governor. With all 
of the machinery of the government 
in full operation, a mob after weeks 
of deliberation walks into the streets 
and brutally beat to death every col¬ 
ored man found. Street cars were 
boarded and innocent men dragged off 


and beaten to death, public buildings 
where colored men were known to be 
were entered and they dragged out and 
murdered in cold blood; if no negroes 
were found the buildings were wrecked. 
Steam railway coaches were wrecked 
for not having negroes aboard. In the 
midst of the wholesale destruction of 
life and property, the Governor, Mayor 
and police were mere spectators. 
When and wherever the police took 
part it was mainly with the mob. The 
use of water instead of shot on the 
mob was the farce it was intended to 
be and had the intended effect—that of 
making the mob more bloodthirsty. 
When the streets were cleared of all 
negroes save the dead ones, the mob 
with police as spectators made the 
mistake of attacking the colored peo¬ 
ple’s houses. The negroes’ trusty rifles 
began to crack, members of the mob 
commenced howling with pain and the 
unhit, skulking cowardly scoundrels 
stampeded to the Governor for protec¬ 
tion. The Governor, who had will¬ 
fully violated his oath of office and 
shown himself void of every manly 
trait, called out the militia, disarmed 
the colored citizens and put hundreds 
of them in jail for giving their wives 
and children the protection that he 
(the Governor) had refused to give 
in violation of his oath. In the face 
of all this murder, outrage and wrong 
against law-abiding American citizens, 
the President, the man of the “Square 
deal,” sits supinely silent. He is too 
much absorbed in protecting the life 
and property of foreigners in a foreign 
country to bother about those of Amer¬ 
ican citizens that are being ruthlessly 
destroyed around the White House 
steps. Do the American people believe 
that righteousness exalteth nations?

WILL VOTE THE PROHIBITION 
TICKET. 

That the great majority of the col¬ 
ored voters will vote the Prohibition 
ticket this year is a certainty. Every 
business and professional man of note 
among the colored people has endorsed 
the ticket and are working for it with 
might' and main. The nomination of 
Mr. Theo. W. Troy for County Auditor 
followed the nomination of Attorney 
C. S. Dardin for Justice of the Peace, 
and has appealed to the pride of the 
black race as nothing else could. Both 
men are clean and capable and when 
elected, which is very probable, will be 
a credit not only to colored voters, but 
the white voters as well. The colored 
citizens have everything to gain and 
nothing to lose by supporting the Pro¬ 
hibition party. It stands for all that 
is pure and holy. It stands for the pu¬ 
rification and uplifting of the Amer¬ 
ican home. It stands for the mental 
and moral purity of the young men 
and women of the nation, in order 
that they may transmit to posterity 
robust, healthy, Christian patriotism 
and civic righteousness. The Pro¬ 
hibition party is unalterably opposed 
to the policy of licensing saloons to 
make physical and moral wrecks of 
our young men and inmates for broth¬ 
els of the young women of this coun¬ 
try. 

The Prohibition party is opposed to 
mob law and all forms of lawlessness; 
and in proportion as Prohibition and 
civic righteousness increases in this 
country, mob violence and its attend¬ 
ant horrors will decrease. 

To the Afro-Americans of Southern 
California and Los Angeles especially 
we say in all candor, that the oppor¬ 
tunity to advance our own interest 
while advancing the common interest 
of all, has come. Insignificant as this 
movement of the colored voters toward 
prohibition may seem, it may turn the 
tide now set in against us in this 
country, to one in favor of us. Breth¬ 
ren, ours is a God given opportunity; 
in the name of our wives and children 
let us make the most of it. 

The white voters, regardless of 
party, who believe in fair play, should 
vote for candidates Troy and Dardin, 
because they are competent and repre¬ 
sent a struggling race that has ever 
been patriotic and faithful to every 
trust and ought to be encouraged. 
Every officeholder in this city and 
county received the votes of the col¬ 
ored* citizens, and what is true of 
them is equally true of all of their 
predecessors. While voting for the 
two colored representatives, the col¬ 
ored voters will vote for white men 
for every other office to be filled. Will 


not the white voters be as liberal? We 
think they will. We do not ask the 
white voters to vote for Troy and 
Dardin because they are negroes, but 
because they are competent to fill the 
offices for which they were nomin¬ 
ated and are representatives of loyal 
citizens and taxpayers who are en¬ 
titled to representation. 


Postmaster Price a Hero. 

All honor to those noble colored wo¬ 
men of Atlanta who, like the Spartans 
they are, beat back the cowardly 
white rufliians who had wet the streets 
of that city with innocent blood. What 
an inspiration to our noble women in 
other mob threatened cities. These 
are the first acts in the bloody drama 
that must come if the present reign of 
lawlessness continues. All honor to 
Postmaster Price. If the charges that 
he furnished arms to the colored men 
with which to protect their wives and 
children is true, he has covered him¬ 
self with everlasting glory. And when 
marched handcuffed at the head of 
that dusky column of heroes through 
the streets of Atlanta, he was the 
leading star in a pageant more glor¬ 
ious than that the world witnessed 
when Caesar entered Rome after the 
conquest of the Britons. The man who 
would refuse protection to women and 
children against a howling blood¬ 
thirsty mob, because he held an office, 
is too despicable to breathe God’s pure 
air. If those degenerate Republicans 
at Washington remove Postmaster 
Price from his office for protecting our 
women and children, let every negro 
man who has a spark of race pride 
left, send him a dollar. We would 
gladly spurn any office in the gift of 
the American people if its retention 
required us to stand by and see our 
people murdered and the -majesty of 
the law trampled in the dust without 
making an effort to uphold the law and 
protect life. 

All honor to Price. May the God 
of war cast his everlasting smile upon 
the negro women soldiery of Atlanta. 
It is no wonder that the Ninth and 
Tenth cavalry have proven themselves 
to be such perfect fighting machines. 

That the black men and women 
must make some member or members 
of every mob bite the dust is now the 
watchword. Once make it certain that 
some member of every mob is to die, 
the white women will keep their hus¬ 
bands and sons at home when mobs 
are being organized and the states 
will be saved the expense of calling 
out the militia to look on while the 
mob gorges itself with innocent blood. 

The State and Federal governments 
being unable or unwilling to protect 
the negro, it now devolves upon the 
negro to protect himself. 

One coincidence connected with the 
Atlanta massacre that must not be for^ 
gotten, is that as socn as negro’s rifles 
began to crack order was restored and 
instead cf calling out the fire depart¬ 
ment, the hospital corps was called

and four or more oath breaking police¬ 
men and a goodly number of the . nob 
needed the services of the coroner. It 
was a good day’s work and splendidly 
avenged all who had been murdered 
during the preceding hours. All who 
were killed by the mob are martyrs to 
the cause of liberty and her soil en¬ 
riched by their blood will bring forth 
an abundant harvest of heroes who 
will carry her banner to victory. Thou¬ 
sands of us will have to die and 
must die willingly that those left be¬

more took their hats preparatory to 
leaving. Miller yelled “sit down dar; 
are you uns gwine to lebe de ’publican 
party, too?” Yes, if you are to manage 
the black end of it,” replied Neimore. 
At this Walker and Neimore retired 
and the bunco steering committee was 
selected and three cheers given to 
Jim Miller, “our new leader.” This 
marks the passing of James Alexan¬ 
der and the rise of James Miller. Thus 
the last state of the black Republicans 
is worse than the first.

THE LICK SPITAL CLUB. 

A few days ago the white Repub¬ 
lican bosses called Jim Miller, janitor 
at the court house, in consultation to 
get his views as to the best means of 
checking the ruinous stampede of col¬ 
ored voters from that party. After 
going over the question at great length 
Miller gave them to understand that 
mere promises would do no good in 
the present emergency, that if he went 
to his race as a bearer of more prom¬ 
ises from the Republican party he 
would be inviting mob violence. In 
lieu of further promises, he suggested 
that he be given funds to purchase 
sandwiches and beer to satisfy the 
stomachs of the hungry colored voters. 
This suggestion was siezed upon as a 
cinch, and Miller was told to go ahead 
and accordingly Miller sent out pri¬ 
vate invitations to his friends and as¬ 
sociates and such others as had griev¬ 
ances, to meet at Judge Blair’s office 
to organize for the purpose above 
mentioned. Judge Blair’s office was 
chosen as the meeting place on the 
presumption that the nomination of 
Attorney Dardin for pity justice, on the 
Prohibition ticket, had given the 
judge a grievance.. Eight persons re¬ 
sponded to the call. Miller, having 
prearranged everything, took, snap 
judgment on Editors Neimore and 
Walker by electing himself president 
and Judge Blair secretary. When the 
result was announced Neimore’s wrath 
knew no bounds. With outstretched 
arm and clenched fist, looking Judge 
Blair in the eye, he said: “The day 
when I am *to follow lickspitals and 
job chasers has gone by.” Miller 
sought to appease the Eagle man’s 
wrath by tendering him and Walker 
places on the bunco steering commit¬ 
tee that is to have the handling of all 
beer to be dished out to the thirsty 
colored voters during the campaign. 

This adding of insult to injury 
brought Walker to his feet and pan¬ 
demonium reigned. Walker and Nei-

Fashion is th expositor of our habits

standpoint of costume. It is a much 
more serious subject than it may seem 
at first, far from serving only as a 
source of frivolous talk, even when 
it is specially concerned with our dress 
and ornamentation, the subject of 
fashion it has been wisely said has its 
value as a moral sign post, and sup¬ 
plies the historian, the philosopher and

The word “fashion” seems to convey 
♦an absolute sense of novelty, but that 
which is new today may be but a re¬ 
vival of what is old. “There is nothing 
new under the sun” applies with spe¬ 
cial force to fashion. The handsome, 
swell suits of today are nothing but 
the reproduction of similar clothing 
worn by our forefathers. 

In Los Angeles the swellest dressed 
man is made by his tailor. The ad¬ 
vantage of a tailor-made suit over a 
readymade is simply great. The 
tailor-made suit made by a practial 
cutter is made for you individually, 
while the “readymade” is made for the 
masses, whoever gets it first So in 
order to be one out of a million wear 
a tailor-made suit.

Wanted—Our business and profession¬ 
al people to get together and father and 
promote enterprises for the employment 
of young folks. If our college-trained 
men and women cannot get together for 
the advancement of the race, whither 
are we drifting? 

Wanted—At once; an Afro-American 
daily paper published in this city. While 
the paper need not be as large as the 
Times and Examiner, it would do more 
good in manufacturing sentiments in fa¬ 
vor of a “square deal” for our people 
than all of the white papers in the city. 
The tendency of the daily papers to cir¬ 
culate damaging falsehoods against us 
is becoming too prevalent With no ap¬ 
parent reason, some of our city dailies 
that have been friendly to us, are now 
molding sentiment against us.
