THE LIBERATOR. 


ADDRESS TO THE VOTERS OF LOS 
ANGELES COUNTY. 


Upon Judge Walter Van Dyke’s elec¬ 
tion to the supreme court, in Novem¬ 
ber, 1898, my name was selected by the 
Los Angeles county bar to be present¬ 
ed to the governor of California for the 
appointment to the vacancy thus cre¬ 
ated in the superior court. 

Judge D. K. Trask, an old-time 
friend of Governor Budd, received the 
appointment. It is unnecessary for me 
to state in this connection that the ap¬ 
pointment was one most worthy. 

Two years since, when two superior 
judges were to be elected, there was a 
difference of opinion among Democrats 
as to whether two candidates should be 
nominated, or only one. I felt that only 
one candidate should be presented; not 
only on account of the Republican ma¬ 
jority, but by reason of the fact that 
such an action would tend to empha¬ 
size upon the voters the idea of a non¬ 
partisan judiciary. Pursuant to that 
sentiment, I withdrew my name from 
consideration as a candidate, entered 
the Democratic county convention, put 
Judge Trask in nomination, and after¬ 
wards took charge of his canvass. 

The Hon. Stephen M. White favored 
a single nomination at that time, and 
he then stated that he would advocate 
in 1902 my being the single nominee 
of the Democratic party for superior 
judge. 

Since then, however, the supreme 
court of California has rendered its de¬ 
cision in the Hanley case, interpreting 
the election law; and the Democratic 
county convention, recently assembled, 
decided to make four nominations. I 
am one of the four nominees of that 
convention, and am a candidate for the 
office of superior judge before the peo¬ 
ple of this county at the coming elec¬ 
tion. 

I invite and invoke, in behalf of my 
candidacy, the good will and support 
of my fellow citizens of all political 
parties. 

If courtesy has characterized me in 
my dealings with my brother members 
of the bar and my fellow men, this 
same courtesy will follow me on the 
bench. 

I take this means of communicating 
with the voters of the county, because 
I believe that a candidate for judicial 


office should not take part in political 
debate, tfor personally solicit votes. 
Most respectfully, 

THOMAS L. WINDER.

MEN WHO THINK.—Commenting 
on the probable action of the white 
voters at the coming election, the 
Times says: 

“Men who think are bound to differ 
on questions of public policy, and to 
vote in accordance with their convic¬ 
tions on these questions.” 

The above is the Times’ opinion of 
white men. Now if white men who 
think are “bound to differ,” negroes 
who think are bound to differ. If ne¬ 
groes do not differ, they don't think. 
Men who don’t think are not men, ac¬ 
cording to the white man’s idea. The 
Times says, further: 

“When the voter enters the booth at 
the polling places, he is subject to the 
control of no other power save his own 
conscience and his own best judgment. 
He is absolutely free to cast his ballot 
in support of such principles and can¬ 
didates as he sees fit. There is no 
power on earth that can compel him 
to vote otherwise than in accord with 
his own will, and there is no authority 
on earth to question his action.” 

The colored voters should take no¬ 
tice and govern themselves accordingly. 
What is good for white men is good for 
the negro. There are several men on 
the Republican ticket that the colored 
voters ought to vote against. Take this 
clipping from the Times in the booth 
with you, and do your duty to yourself. 

-o- 

As a race our greatest fight is for ' 
representation, and those who give it 
to us will win our everlasting friend¬ 
ship. This is a phase in politics that 
many seem to overlook when the col¬ 
ored citizen is considered, and by so 
doing they .make a very great mistake. 
—Western Outlook. 

Right, brother; but we will never get 
it by blowing hoi and cold, but by con-, 
stant, persistent effort. The man who 
decieves us must be made to know that 
he has forfeited our confidence. A po¬ 
lite bow, a slap on the shoulder during 
campaigns, has too often been accepted 
by the negro as pay for political servi¬ 
tude,

JUDGE D. K. TRASK. 


JUDGE TRASK.—The nomination of 
Judge Trask for associate justice of the 
supreme court by the state Democratic 
convention was a fitting recognition of 
an able, conscientious judicial officer. 
He is now serving his second term a.* 
one of the superior judges of this coun¬ 
ty. He served the people so well in 


NO FAITH IN PARDEE.—The Paci¬ 
fic Coast Appeal, about the only colored 
journal in the state thus far that is 
taking any active interest in Doctor 
Pai dee’s candidacy, displayed its ed¬ 
itor’s lack of confidence in him by 
swinging from its mast head the dis¬ 
carded, discredited bloody shirt. Now 
if Brother Watkins is what we have 
given him credit for being—a man of 
good horse sense, he must have con¬ 
cluded after personal investigation that, 
if the colored voters are to be lined up 
for the doctor, his only hope lay in the 
adoption of that old heathenish custom 
of appealing to their prejudice. What 
has Abraham Lincoln, Charles Sumner 
and civil war and events of that period 


ihis -capacity that he was elected over 
his Republican opponent by 1800 major¬ 
ity two yea ,i s ago, although the county 
went Republican by 3000. Between 
Judge Trask and Judge iShaw, his op 
ponent, the chances seem even. Both 
are able men. To make the court non- 
partisan, a thing desired, the voters 
may elect Judge Trask. 


got to do with the issues in this cam¬ 
paign? What do the platforms of the 
two parties in this state say about 
these dead issvies? What has the Re¬ 
publican platform to say about the 
negro and his rights? To tell the truth 
we in a measure sympathize with 
Brother Watkins in his extremity. He 
reminds us of a cow pen pettifogger 
with a client but no case. That Dr. 
Pardee is a good man and an excellent 
tooth puller, perhaps no one will deny, 
but the governor of this great state 
should be a man of larger qualifications. 
What is there in the past history of 
Mr Pardee that appeals to the fellow 
feeling of the colored voters or the 
white workingmen of this state? If Mr. 


Watkins could convince the white vot¬ 
ers of this state that appealing to pas¬ 
sion is the best method of handling the 
colored vote, the white man’s estimate 
of the negro would be lowered every¬ 
where in the state. The negro journal 
that adopts an argument to get the ne¬ 
gro’s vote that is entirely different 
from the one adopted to get the white 
man’s vote, for the same candidates 
and issues, either admits the inferior¬ 
ity of the negro voter or is attempting 
to vote him against his interest as a 
man and citizen. Now we believe that 
interest of the negro in this state Is 
identical with that of the white man 
and the reasoning that is good for one 
is good for the other. The Republican 
candidate for governor is a man born 
and rfared in affluence, whose environ¬ 
ments have been such as to prevent any 
fellow feeling for the great body of 
workingmen in the state. Mr. Lane, his 
oppoi ent, started in life as a printer, 
worked his way through college, and 
by dint of hard work, close application 
to duty, has ,made himself one of the 
foremost lawyers of the state. 

Doctor Pardee is a native son and Is 
charged with bringing about the defeat 
of the proposition to admit into the as¬ 
sociation, parlors composed of colored 
native sons. This charge as far as we 
can lean has not been denied by the 
doctor or his friends. If he is guilty 
every intelligent negro in the state ap¬ 
prised of the fact will vote against him. 
The Appeal’s attempt to play on the 
negro’s passions will injure rather than 
help the cause of Mr. Pardee among the 
intelligent colored voters. If Mr. Wat¬ 
kins hopes to turn the tide of colored 
votes that has set in against his candi¬ 
date he will have to appeal to their in¬ 
telligence and will have to change the 
attitude of the party in this state to¬ 
ward them. The defeat of Dr. Pardee, 
which seems very probable, will not de¬ 
crease the wages of a single working 
man in this state. This is well under¬ 
stood. 

--o-- 

SHOULD VOTE AGAINST WARD. 

If the colored voters hope to share 
the patronage secured by the aid of 
their votes, they will have to scratch 
men like Mr. Ben E. Ward. He has held 
the position of city tax assessor for a 
number of years, and although at the 
busy season employs many extra clerks 
he has given the colored voters no 
recognition whatever. He has always 
had the loyal support of the colored 
voters, and has always ignored them 
after the election. For the colored 
voters to assist in putting hi,m into the 
county assessor’s office would simply 
indorse the treatment he has always 
given them. If the negroes, the mtel- 
ligent negroes, will do the.r duty in the 
booth, they will he regarded and treat¬ 
ed as something more than mere vot¬ 
ing cattle. Cut this out.

THE BLACK REPUBLICAN.— What 
is to become of the black Republicans 
of this country is a mystery. With the 
Republican party in full control of tlie 
national government, the have been 
completely stripped of their constitu¬ 
tional rights, trial by jury suspended 
both North and South. Wholesale 
lynchings are of daily occurence, burn¬ 
ings at the slake with slow fires and 
untold torture have become so common 
that Republican papers deem them un¬ 
worthy of comment. White Republicans 
in the South disfranchise the black 
ones. They are driven from their 
homes in the Republican states of Il¬ 
linois and Indiana for the crime of be¬ 
ing black, just as Californians drive out 
jack rabbits for destroying their orch¬ 
ards. What is to become of the black 
Republican is becoming a serious ques¬ 
tion. Nobody cares for the black Re¬ 
publican. 

- o - 

SHAMELESS HYPOCRISY —Secre¬ 
tary Hay’s plea for the Jews of Rou- 
mania, in the face of the fact that each 


day witnesses the burning of a negro 
at the stake with fiendish brutality or 
a wholesale lynching of negroes in the 
United States, puts him and the country 
in a ridiculous position. It is a blot on 
the fair name of the twentieth century 
civilization. 

-o- 

The W. C. T. U. is making war on 
nude female pictures. This is com¬ 
mendable, but the fellow who is not 
seven-eighths a hypocrite is at a loss 
to know which is to be regarded as the 
most demoralizing to the boys and girls 
of the country, looking at nude female 
pictures or witnessing the burning of 
nude negro men at the stake. 

---o- 

HON. FRANKLIN K. LANE.—The 
election of Mr. Lane as governor of 
this state is by no means improbable. 
In fact the feeling that he will be elect¬ 
ed is gaining ground among all classes 
of voters. This is a great state and its 
governor should be a statesman of abil¬ 
ity and breadth, should be a man whose 
environments put him in touch with 
the great body of the people; in short, 
he should be a great man to rightly di¬ 
rect its affairs. The candidate who 
comes fully up to these requirements 
is the Honorable Franklin K. Lane. He 
is.eminently fitted to perform the du¬ 
ties of chief magistrate of this great 
state with credit and dignity to all con¬ 
cerned. • To this, all agree. 

He has been three times elected city 
and county attorney of San Francisco, 
with increased majority. His ability as a 
lawyer and faithfulness to public trust 
need no better indorsement. While no 
honorable man would say aught against 
the private character of Dr. Pardee, in 
point of statesmanship and legal abil¬ 
ity there is no comparison between 
Lane and Pardee. Mr. Lane is a states¬ 
man by training and environment. Dr. 
Pardee is a dentist and stands well in 
his profession. Mr. Lane worked his 
way up from among the toilers and his 
success is an inspiration to his fellow 
toilers. Dr. Pardee is still where he 
was born. 

That Mr. Lane will poll thousands of 
colored votes goes without'saying. The 
negro is doing so,me thinking for him¬ 
self and is no longer swayed by his 
prejudice. He has learned that the 
best way to protect his rights and pro¬ 
mote his interest is to vote for his 
friends regardless of party, that is, di¬ 
vide in politics just as white men do. 
For a class to vote as a unit for one 
party regardless of issues or fitness of 
candidates is un-American and danger¬ 
ous, and the class that does this will 
soon find itself in the position of the 
American negro today. This is so well 
understood by the negroes of this state 
that no argument is needed tu maiicts 


them to look to their own interest. If 
Mr. Lane is elected the negro will hold 
all that he has and more. The,ruthless 
slaughter of Governor Gage and Sheriff 
Harumel, two staunch friends of the ne¬ 
groes, puts them in doubt as to where 
they will stand in the event of Pardee’s 
election. From a Republican stand¬ 
point the outlook of the negro is 
gloomy. 

-o- 

CAPT. J. C. NEWTON.—Of the nu¬ 
merous candidates desiring the suffrage 
of the voters at the coming election 
none are more deserving than Capt. J. 
C. Newton, wilo is a candidate for the 
office of county tax assessor. He Is a 
rancher with large holdings in real 
estate, and therefore is a heavy tax¬ 
payer. This puts him in touch and 
sympathy with the great army of farm¬ 
ers whose farms and farm products pro- 
ducetli e wealth and pay the taxes of 
the county. Among the officeholders 
who conduct the affairs of the county, 
the country districts should be repre¬ 
sented, and in no office are they more 
directly interested than in that of the 
tax assessor's. Capt. Newton is in 
every way fitted for the position and 
if elected the interest of every class 
will be served, both city and county 
alike. While the captain is not run¬ 
ning upon his war record, but upon his 
merit as a citizen and taxpayer, it will 
certainly not be out of place for i:s to 
state that he was with General Banks 
at the siege of Port Hudson, and for 
gallantry displayed on the firing line 
he was promoted to the captaincy. As 
a reminder of those stirring days he 
carries with him a battle scar. Forty 
years ago on the coming Fourth of July 
he was in command of his company in 
the rifle pit before Port Hudson, sup¬ 
porting Holcomb’s Massachusetts bat¬ 
tery. He was wounded at Mount 
Pleasant. 

His opponent, Mr. Ward, is a man of 
i,mmense wealth and has been holding 
office in the city government for a num 
ber of years, and wants the office of 
county assessor as a change of atmos¬ 
phere, or to supply the missing link in 
the court house and city hall ring. If 
the best interests of all of the taxpayers 
is to be served, this little exclusive set 
formed to run the affairs of the county 
and city as a sort of -a private snap 
must be smashed now. 

-o- 

For sheriff, vote for John T. Wilson. 
Your vote will help to swell his ma¬ 
jority. His election is certain.

HON. EDWARD L. HUTCHISON. 

“All good people should he treated 
alike; the line should be drawn be¬ 
tween the good and bad,” said Mr. 
Hutchison when called upon to write 
a letter for publication as to whether 
colored women's clubs should be ad¬ 
mitted into the general federation. 
Those lofty, manly expressions uttered 
at a time and under the circumstances 
calling them forth, would have graced 
an Abraham Lincoln. They were not 
the words of a self-seeker or a dema¬ 
gogue, or a chaser of cheap notoriety, 
for they were all on the other side, 
but were the inspiring expressions from 
the heart of a great man who is willing 



HON. EDWARD L. HUTCHISON. 


to recognize and extend a helping hand 
to merit whenever found. The voters of 
the 36th senatorial district can make 
no mistake by electing Mr. Hutchison 
senator. Mr. Hutchison's broad, manly 
position on the race question quoted 
above entitles him to every colored vote 
in his district, and we believe he will 
get them, because we know that they 
are in sympathy with the Liberator and 
the cause for which it stands. Between 
Mr. Hutchison and Mr. Hahn, his op¬ 
ponent, there is no comparison. The 
colored men who know one or both of 
them, will vote for Mr. Hutchison. He 
looks like a winner. 


A vote for James Hanley means rep¬ 
resentation on the state board of equa’- 
ization for this, the Fourth district. 
This is very important to the voters 
and taxpayers and should not be over¬ 
looked. This district should, and must 
be, represented. 

- & -— 

The friends of Mr. Le Compte Davis 
have only a few more days in which to 
strive. While his election by a safe ma¬ 
jority is almoe \ assured, still they must 
hammer all along the line till the vote 
is counted. Don’t fail to be on hand 
early November 4. 

—-o—-- 

The friends of Mr. H. T. Gordon are 
putting in some solid work to elect 
him to the position of superior judge. 
He is a gentleman of ability and cul¬ 
ture, and would be not only an effi¬ 
cient officer, but an ornament to the 
bench. He will appreciate your vote 
and you will not regret it, 

-o- : — 

The editor of this journal is a black 
man that plows for a living, therefore 
he can advocate nothing that will in¬ 
jure the negroes without injuring him¬ 
self. This paper is against any man 
who is against the negro; the friend of 
any man who is the friend of the ne¬ 
gro. Politics cut no figure with us. 

-o- 

The Outlook has finally come out for 
Dr. Pardee, but it is not over confident 
about his election. It admits that the 
election will be close, and that the ne¬ 
gro is divided. In this it takes an 
honest position. The Outlook Is mis¬ 
taken, however, if it thinks that the de¬ 
feat of Dr. Pardee will “Turn the 
wheels of progress backward”; they are 
not so easily turned about. They were 
rolling when Lincoln and McKinley 
died, they are rolling yet, and they will 
be rolling when Lane and Pardee are 
forgotten. If the negro divides his vote 
he will get what he wants without bolt¬ 
ing. Politically, everything that the 
negro has lost he lost while voting as a 
unit for the Republican party. The 
white voters are divided and the negro 
may profit by their example. 


THAT RALLY.—The colored Repub¬ 
lican rally is in charge of Mr. James 
Miller, janitor at the court house. The 
Enterprise people and the Eagle man 
seem to have been overlooked. The 
way of the intelligent colored Repub¬ 
lican is hard. The party ignores him, 
disfranchises him and the mob burns 
him, hangs, skins him.

One of our contemporaries tells about 
a white principal in Ohio, who made 
white girls kiss their colored school¬ 
mates. It seems highly indignant over 
the performance. That’s nothing. 
White men about here have been kiss¬ 
ing negro women for years, and their 
21-year-old offsprings are now rising 
up and telling the registrars about it.

Assults a Colored Girl. 

Moritz Cypron, a young man of 21 
years, who lives on Wall street, be¬ 
tween Fourth and Winston streets, was 
arrested at San Pedro yesterday and 
brought to this city, where he was 
booked at the police station on a xeiony 
charge. Cypron, who is a painter and 
is said to belong to the Painters’ union, 
is a revolting specimen of the degener 
ate, if the charges against him are true. 

On the 7th inst. Cypron was employed 
by Contractor Kratzer on the house at 
No. 1426 West Twentieth street. He 
was alone on the job, and during the 
noon hour he is said to have enticed 
the 5-year-old daughter of Frederick 
Ballard, colored, who lives near, into 
the building, and to have taken liber¬ 
ties with her. 

Ballard entered the building and saw 
Cypron groveling in this beastly lust. 
Cypron escaped the father’s furious on¬ 
slaught, and escaped, leaving the city. 
Detectives watched his house for sev¬ 
eral days, but Cypron did not return. 
Yesterday the young ,man’~ mother took 
the train for San Pedro and a detective 
followed her. Under the eye of the 
officer she sought out her son and gave 
him $10, telling him to leave the coun¬ 
try. He was more anxious to take this 
course than his mother was to have 
him, but was apprehended.

THE LIBERATOR. 


THE SAVAGRY OF CIVILIZATION. 


Once more every American must 
blush for an atrocious crime committed 
by his countrymen. This is the only 
country on the globe, outside of the 
jungles inhabited by barbarians, where 
human beings are burned to death as 
a punishment for crime. This sort of 
anarchy is becoming fashionable in the 
United States, and it is not confined to 
any section, as witness the inciner, 
ation of a living negro at Lyman, Col., 
a few months ago. The taking of hu_ 
,man life in fny form is wrong, Includ¬ 
ing all kinds of legal executions; but 
killing people by torture makes our 
claim of being a “Christian nation” as 
grotesque as it is blasphemous. 

That the “leading citizens” are chief 
actors in these revolting and utterly 
heartless tragedies merely makes the 
offense the more reprehensible. “Lead¬ 
ing citizens” can discharge their social 
obligations to the community only by 
giving character and dignity to it. 
They will have little cause for com¬ 
plaint in the future should the anarchy 
to which they are now giving counten¬ 
ance grow beyond control of ‘heading 
people.” and react upon them. Setting 
fashions of this sort is literally * 
“p’aying with fire,” of which the most 
reckless may well beware. 

Mob violence, whether in Mississippi, 
Colorado or California, should be se¬ 
verely denounced by every good citizen. 
—Union Labor News. 

“The News” takes a commendable 
position and speaks out in strong 
terms for the enforcement of the laws. 
That the American people are silently 
giving aid, comfort and protection to 
the jnob cannot be denied, and that 
they will pay the penalty eye for eye 
and tooth for tooth is as certain as 
night follows day. Time has proven 
more than once that national sins are 
followed by national punishment. The 
cruel wrongs of slavery were followed 
by the slaughter of the Wilderness and 
Gettysburg, Andersonville and Libby. 
The News says: “Mob violence should 
be severely denounced by all good citi¬ 
zens.” This will do no good now; it 
will require sterner measures than 
mere denunciation. The methods used 
by the mob to dispatch their defense¬ 
less and very often innocent victims 
will have to be used upon the mob. It 


will listen to no other argument. This 
will bring on a revolution,thesoonerthe 
better, for it must come. This is plain 
talk, the kind the Americans need, for 
if our institutions are to be preserved, 
if life is to be safe, prompt and deci¬ 
sive action will have to be taken. The 
national government will have to se¬ 
cure to every citizen the full protection 
of the laws or forfeit its right to exist¬ 
ence and perish. It looks as if this 
nation had reached its zenith. It is 
drunk on the wine of prosperity, and 
while under its deadly spell crime is 
everywhere on the increase. The at, 
counts of mobs, murder, suicide, adul¬ 
tery, fornication, divorces, insanity, 
bloody strikes and lockouts take up as 
jnuch space in the daily papers as is 
required to give the country’s commer¬ 
cial and social news. Burning human 
beings at the stake with indescribable 
torture are now monthly occurrences 
and are made gala spectacles, excur¬ 
sions are run and whole towns turn 
out to witness them. These increas¬ 
ing eruptions on the body politic show 
the state of the national blood. To call 
this a Christian nation is indeed “blas¬ 
phemous.” The hypocritical howl 
about the persecuted Jews of Roumania 
simply excites the contempt of the civ¬ 
ilized nations who are witnesses of the 
relentless persecution with fire and 
sword of the American negroes. 

For humanity’s sake, the American 
people ought to put away their sword.

COLORED MEN KNIFING PARDEE. 

It has come to the surface that the 
colored population has a grievance 
against Dr. Pardee. The story that 
some of their leaders are telling is that 
when certain young colored people de¬ 
sired to organize a parlor of the Native 
Sons of the Golden West, Dr. Pardee 
opposed the proposition and defeated it, 
and that in so doing he was actuated by 
race prejudice. This story has been 
sent from one part of the state to the 
other, and the result is that Lane Col¬ 
ored clubs are being formed in various 
counties wherever there are a sufficient 
number of colored men to set up an or¬ 
ganization. William Sampson has al¬ 
ready organized one of these clubs in 
Fresno. 


The white people of this country 
treat a worthless vagrant negro with 
more respect than they do a white 
man of the same character. They speak 
of such a negro as a “man,” “poor ne¬ 
gro man” or “colored man.” But the 
worthless white wanderer forfeits the 
noble title of “man” and is spoken of 
as a “tramp.”

E. M. M. CURTIVE CO. 


The institute of the E. M. Cura¬ 
tive Company is located at 529 South 
Broadway, Los Angeles, and is equ'p- 
ped with one of the largest pipe organs 
ever built. It will be automatic in 
action, and is the first ever used a3 a 
curative remedy in connection with the 
administration of electricity and mag¬ 
netism. The institute is most elabo¬ 
rately furnished as to every detail and 
attracts large crowds daily to its par¬ 
lors. 

The public are warjnly received, and 
the attendants are more than happy In 
entertaining all visitors during the 
time they are in the institution. 

MUSIC AS A CURE. 

This may well be called the age of 
electricity; vibration is life and elec¬ 
tricity is the spark. The manifold dis¬ 
coveries in this field of science ejn- 
braces every department of modern in¬ 
dustry. Electricity it is evident has for 
a long time been used in the treatment 
of various diseases, but it has failed to 
give that satisfaction as to its efficacy 
that many have claimed for it. This 
comes from some defects in its method 
of application. 

A patent has recently been granted 
for a new curative method that com¬ 
bines electricity, music and magnetism. 
By an electric connection these forces 
are combined so as to give musical vi¬ 
bration, electricity and ^magnetism to¬ 
gether. ; ! j.j Lai

The white electric wire workers de¬ 
manded that the street car companies 
should not employ colored men to 
string wires, and threatened to throw 
the city in darkness. The meeting 
with President Sitterding resulted in 
their request being complied with. 
Other white men are now “kicking” be¬ 
cause colored men are employed by 
contractors in digging aitches in the 
streets of this city. It will be seen 
that they are not after the loafing, dis¬ 
solute colored man, but after those who 
will work.—Richmond Planet.

" The lynehings in the South have be¬ 
come epidemic. Trial by jury for a ne¬ 
gro charged with crime is now the ex¬ 
ception. The negro who by p.eading 
guilty to a crime that perhaps a white 
man committed, escapes being burned 
at the stake by getting the sheiiff to 
hang him in fifteen minutes, after mak¬ 
ing his plea, considers himself lucky. 
Thank God, we -are nearing the end 
of these Christian barbarities. Let 
the mobs increase their torture and 
multiply the number of their victims. 
Let them cook their meals with living 
negro flesh and gorge themselves with 
human misery. “Whom the Gods would 
destroy they first make mad.”
