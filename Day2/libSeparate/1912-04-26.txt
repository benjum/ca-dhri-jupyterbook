A Trip through the Imperial Valley, the 
Nile Valiev of America 


EDITOR EDMONDS AND 
FRIENDS VISIT OLD MEXICO. 
THE GREAT IMPERIAL VAL¬ 
LEY TRAVERSED. THE 
NILES VALLEY OF AMERICA 
VISITED. MANY THRIVING 
TOWNS. 

For some time Editor Edmonds, 
Attorney G. Woodson Wickliffe 
and Mr. T. N. Alexander, one of 
our hustling real estate and in¬ 
surance promotors, had been 
planning a trip through the Im¬ 
perial Valley. All things ready, 
we boarded the 10.15 
Sunset train bound for 
New Orleans. It was a heavy 
train, made up of 12 or more giant 
cars and sleepers drawn by a 
mammoth locomotive, a machine 
of unknown power. Taking our 
seats in the magnificent chair car, 
the splendid train puiled out ancl 
once out of the city limits, the 
mighty machine bounded along 
with the agility of a greyhound. 

The early daylight hours found 
our train rushing along on the 
shores of the Salton Sea: not far 
from which is Imperial Junction, 
130 feet below seal level. Here we 
changed cars and although our 
trains took widely diverging routes 
they were in sight of each other 
more than a half hour, so broad 
and level is the valley. 

A run of 18 miles through a 
country of marvelous fertility 
brought us to Brawley, a town 
young, vigorous, bright and new, 
that has sprung up out of the desert 
like a vision. At the Bungalow 
Hotel ,the finest in town, we had 
a breakfast that would do credit 


to any town. The streets of Braw¬ 
ley are paved, broad and clean. 
The business houses are well built, 
modern and attractive and an air 
of peace and prosperity pervades 
everything. There are several 
banks, every class of business being 
well represented but the rum traffic; 
the money that usually flows into 
that channel is used for building 
homes, churches and schools. Be¬ 
sides seven churches, it has one of 
the most attractive grammar 
school building in the state. Its 
beautiful homes and grounds would 
lend a charm to any land scape. 

A Ride Among the Farms. 

After we breakfasted, Mr. P. 
Jones, one of Brawley’s first and 
most wide awake citizens, took 
us in his automobile for a sight 
seeing tour of that most fertile 
valley on the face of the earth. 
It was a real joy ride of 82 miles 
through one continuous ocean of 
green, waving grain, alfalfa, bar¬ 
ley and wheat—some of the finest 
we ever saw. Sleek horses and 
cattle by the thousands, with fat 
hogs and sheep sandwiched in, 
formed an unbroken chain of teem¬ 
ing wealth. Everywhere, on every 
hand, were the homes of the happy, 
prosperous farmers whose dwellings 
were all the way from bunks by 
the wayside to commodious modern 
buildings. Through the tele¬ 
phone, the “hello girl's” voice is 
heard in the homes of the farmers 
as in the cities. The rural mail 
carrier and the daily i:>aper visit 
them every day. 


Irrigation. 

owing to the abundant supply 
of water, all growing crops are 
irrigated. As a result there is 
no such a thing as failure and crops 
are always large, paying the far¬ 
mers big profits. Go where you 
will over the splendid public roads 
or through farms and irrigating 
ditches, large and small, brim full 
of creamy looking water, laden 
with rich silt from the Colorado 
River, which not only irrigates 
the crops, but enriches the soil, 
continually adding to its fertility. 
A condition that exists in no other 
valley in the world save the Nile, 
With an abundant supply of silt 
laden water, farther enriching a 
soil of inexhaustible fertility; with 
a climate so mild that the question 
of housing is one of small consider¬ 
ation, ^ it is no wonder that the 
Imperial Valley farmers are living 
easily,-enjoying life while accumu¬ 
lating fortunes. 

Value of Farm Products. 

In every sense of the term, 
farming in the valley is diversified: 
grain and hay growing, stock rais¬ 
ing, dairying, cotton growing, 
oranges, lemons, grape fruit, dates, 
grapes and deciduous fruit, melons, 
cantaloupes, pumpkins and vege¬ 
tables. The value of products 
ranges from $50 to $100 an acre 
and higher. 

The dairying industry is carried 
on to such extent that wagon loads 
of milk cans are seen everywhere 
along the public highway. 

The country is literally covered

THE LIBERATOR 


with poultry which is one of the 
paying industries of the valley. 

We saw thousands of acres of 
cantaloupes, passing one ranch of 
800 acres. This ranch is rented 
and farmed by Japanese who pay 
$18 per acre, cash. 

The untouched industry of the 
valley is vegetable raising. For¬ 
tunes await gardeners. Vegetables 
grown on four lots, two thirds of 
an acre, sold for $600. One acre 
of peas, $200. These vegetables 
w r ere produced at Brawley. 

Towns Visited. 

Our trip included a visit to Her- 
ber, Holtville, Calexico, Mexicali, 
Mexico, El Centro and Imperial, 
all prosperous, well-built, thriving, 
business centers with splendid 
church and school buildings. El 
Centro and Imperial have a popu¬ 
lation of 3,000 and 2,000, respec¬ 
tively. The business section of 
El Centro represents much enter¬ 
prise and wealth. 

At Calexico we got dinner at 
the California Hotel, the largest 
and best equipped in the town. 
This hotel has all of the business 
people of the town and country 
around and is run by Mr. and Mrs. 
R. E. Stewart, colored, who enjoy 
the reputation of furnishing the 
finest meals in the Valley. The 
dinner served us took nothing from 
their reputation. 

Old Mexico. 

After luncheon, Mr. Jones took 
us to the international line. Hop¬ 
ping out of the auto, we lost no 
time in getting into that quaint 
border town with low adobe houses 
and narrow, crooked streets—if 
such they may be called.. 

Just over the line under a tent 
with a few chairs sat a Mexican 
and a small child. We learned af¬ 
terwards that the man was a sol¬ 
dier and an attache of the Mexican 
custom house which sat back on 
the second street. 

There being no whiskey sold in 
Imperial County the principal busi¬ 
ness in Mexicali is saloon keeping. 
We saw but one grocery store in 


the town. Although, under the 
new mayor, the town is said to 
have the “lid” on, drunken Mexi¬ 
cans were bring about the streets 
like cross ties, among whom were 
a few white Americans. After a 
man gets hog drunk, he is never 
disturbed by the officers, but is 
left to wallow around till he sobers 
up. They look only after the 
tiger drunks. 

From the banks of New Colorado 
River, we overlooked the battle 
ground where 56 Mexicans were 
killed in the battle between the 
Diaz and Madero forces in the 
revolution of last year. 

We visited the bull pen where 
prisoners of war were kept. 

Was It Veno? 

The editor met an old Angeleno 
who insisted on the editor visit¬ 
ing his business place which con¬ 
sisted of a saloon, dance hall 
and lodging house combined, con¬ 
taining 15 rooms, when he returned 
and reported to his campanions 
what he had seen pointing out the 
house, looking the editor straight 
in the eyes, one of them said: 

“Say how much veno have you 
had? If you saw 15 rooms in that 
cabin you must have drunk some¬ 
thing. n 

It was a good joke but the ques¬ 
tioners looked awful serious. 

The Bixby Ranch. 

Although taking a different 
route for our return trip, it was a 
duplication of the former. Every¬ 
where were leaping, roaring canals, 
broad fertile acres laden with 
golden harvests; live stock and 
poultry on every hand; every man, 
woman and child a picture of health 
and contentment. 

At the famous Bixby ranch, 
the gem of the valley, we saw 45 
acres of growing cotton. This cot¬ 
ton was planted in March and 
although it had received no cul¬ 
tivation, since planting, it is free 
from weeds, with a regular stand 
from end to end with four leaves 
on the stalks, the whole being 
in a healthy condition. 

The cost of raising cotton in 
the Imperial valley is about one 
half the cost of raising it in the 


South. In other words, one acre 
in Imperial will produce as much 
as two acres in the South at a cost 
of one half. 

The Bixby ranch consists of 80 
acres managed by Mr. Bixby, the 
proprietor, a man of 70 years 
but who moves about like a man 
of forty. The farming on this 
ranch is so diversified that nearly 
everything in the state is found 
there: oranges, lemons, grape fruit, 
grapes, apricots, olives and berries, 
all in first class condition.

The discovery that the places

Hospital can all be filled on short

sphere. The majority of the em¬

intelligence is such that they will 
do just as told to do by those in 
authority; and, have no idea of 
handing in their resignations, un¬ 
less they are demanded. 












THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


OUGHT REV. PECK BE ELECT¬ 
ED BISHOP? THE LAIETY 
SAYS NO. HIS ELECTION 
WOULD BE A CALAMITY. 

The best way to estimate a man's 
real worth to his race or community 
is by the part he takes in its battles 
for its moral uplift. Measured 
by this standard, Rev. Peck's elec¬ 
tion to the bishopric would be a 
calamity to his race and church 
in this state. Show up the un¬ 
fitness of an individual to fill a 
certain position, and his friends 
raise the hue and cry that you 
are fighting the church or or¬ 
ganization to which the unfit in¬ 
dividual belongs. When we say 
that Rev. Peck is an unsiutable 
person for bishop, we are not only, 
not making a fight on the great 
A. M. E. church, but are making 
a fight for that church. 

If the A. M. E. Church is to 
fulfil its mission, it must have in 
its council of bishops, broad, able, 
strong men, strong enough to stand 
with the people who are laboring 
for the moral advancement of his 
community. 

This Rev. Peck has not been 
able to do as pastor in this city. 
As an individual, we have abso¬ 
lutely no feelings against that 
gentleman. 

The Liberator takes no special 
notice of individuals as such, but 
only as they represent certain 
principles and policies. As such 
representatives they either advance 
or retard the principles they are 
supposed to represent. It is here 
we take notice of what they say 
and do. 

Stood for Vice. 

When the municipal campaign 
was on three years ago and the 
question was up for settlement, 
whether this city should be an 
open town, run by the saloons in 
the interest of vice and shame, 
Rev. Peck cast his lot with those 
who battled for an open town and 
fought in their ranks. To the 
friends of Good Government, Rev. 
Peck's position in that memorable 
struggle was a hard blow. While 
every church in the city stood open 


day and night, in deadly combat 
with vice, Rev. Peck's church stood 
closed, dark and silent, while he 
was acting as the star of attrac¬ 
tion for the open town rallies. 
Being the pastor of one of the largest 
Negro churches in the state, his 
actions were not only a serious 
reflection upon all of the Negro 
churches but upon each individual 
Negro. But by the grace of God, 
Good Government won in spite 
of Rev. Peck, and his race was saved 
from the everlasting odium that 
his actions would have cast upon 
them, had defeat overtaken the 
cause of righteousness. 

In the late campaign in this 
city, when the prohibition question 
was up before the voters as to 
whether the city should be wet or 
dry, Rev. Peck was struck suddenly 
dumb on the last Sunday before 
the election which was to take 
place on the Tuesday following. 
The people who were fighting for 
the protection of the home, strained 
every muscle in their efforts to 
have every pastor in the city preach 
a special sermon in the interest of 
prohibition on that Sunday. In 
spite of all the holy interests at 
stake, Rev. Peck had nothing to 
say. It was a silence in the house 
of God, carrying with it the seal 
of death, when to speak was life. 

It was a silence that made vice 
laugh and virtue weep. It was a 
silence that opened wide the way 
that leads to death, while closing 
the highway that leads to the city 
where cometh no night. 

But why more? If the preachers 
who occupy our pulpits cannot 
lend us a hand when we are strug¬ 
gling to throw the arm of protec¬ 
tion around the homes, when can 
they help us? 

Ward Political Methods. 

In his fight to make a bishop of 
himself, acting as it were upon the 
viscious idea that: Tis sweet 

to win , no matter how ones laurels ," 
Rev. Peck has regarded no ward 
political methods too raw, or claims 
too extravagant to make, if only 
he could advance his interest in 
his fight for the highest and holiest 


office in the gift of the church. 

A few Sundays ago his church was 
turned over to the railroad porters 
in order that they might influence 
the Conference to elect him bishop 
But the mistake of asking the por¬ 
ters to donate $75 to purchase him, 
Peck, a suit of clothes, was made. 
This they indignantly refused to 
do and broke out of the church. 

Although he did what he could 
to defeat the Mayor and the Good 
Government ticket, he went to the 
Mayor for an endorsement or allowed 
his friends to do so. Not to be out 
done, he went to the Chamber of 
Commerce with a proposition for 
the Chamber of Commerce and the 
Genera] Conference of the A. M. E. 
church to go into a real estate, African 
immigration exhibition business. 
The Chamber of Commerce turned 
the scheme down by promising 
any kind of aid except financial 
aid. Then appeals were made 
to our good women for finance. 

Though the half has not been 
told, enough has been said. Oh, 
no, on the Sunday before the pro¬ 
hibition election, Rev. Peck said 
nothing against whiskey. On that 
Sunday whiskey detectives attended 
his services to take notes. They 
made a good report.

THE LOSS OF THE TITANIC 


The Titanic, the mightiest ship 
ever floated, is at the bottom of 
the ocean. The loss of life attend¬ 
ing her sinking was simply appall¬ 
ing. The thought of it makes the 
world shudder. It was over-con¬ 
fidence in the power of money 
to build a ship that could bid de¬ 
fiance to the elements of the deep 
that led to that awful scarifice. 
That, wealth cannot do, and wealth 
has learned it at an awful' cost. 
In the presence of the elements of 
nature all are poor. The Titanic 
was . built for millionaires.' All 
their whims were catered to in 


her construction and their belief 
that she was unsinkable has con¬ 
signed some of them to an obscure 
ocean cavern two miles below the 
surface. Over confidence in the 
ship's power to collide with ice 
bergs and still float has exacted 
an awful toll. Then to, vast 
wealth has made its possessors 
insane on the question of record 
breaking. Wealthy people have 
nothing to do but break records. 

Riding at anchor the mighty 
Titanic stood complete, the finest, 
biggest ship the world had ever 
seen. Belshazzar's banqueting 
halls had been out done, and men 
of great wealth made a rush to 
secure passage on her and share 
in the glory of the record she was 
to make. It has proven an awful 
record. There were, of course, 
hundreds of ordinary human be¬ 
ings on board, but they served as 
“fillers” or revenue-paying ballast. 

It was Sunday, the Christian's 
holy Sabbath, the proud vessel 
had triumphantly glided over the 
bounding tide for three days like 
a wild express train. It was an 
event worth celebrating and Sun¬ 
day night was a good time for its 
consummation. Speaking of the 
occassion an assistant steward says: 

“It was the gayest night of the 
trip among the diners,” said Thom¬ 
as Whitley, assistant steward. “We 
had made great time, and the 
probability was that the trip would 
be a record breaker. Orders had 
been issued Sunday to make the 
dinner the finest ever served on 
a ship and the orders were carried 
out. 

“They drank one toast,” says 
Whitley, “to 'Mighty Titanic,' 
another toast was drunk to 'Speed'. 
The wine flowed.” 

Now read Daniel 5:3:4 and 
note the resemblance. 

The end came. The mammoth 
steamer rushing headlong through 
the night at a terrific speed—a 
speed in keeping with the gay diners 
in her magnificent cabin—ran 
prone on to a mountain of ice, 
received her death wound, slid back, 
and plunged to everlasting night 
carrying down to death nearly 
2000 precious souls. 


The Poverty of the Rich. 

That awful shock sent a tremor 
through every frame. “The ves¬ 
sel is doomed” brought every per¬ 
son who could come to the deck. 
In that unfortunate group of ex¬ 
treme rich and poor stood six men 
whose combined wealth is some¬ 
thing like a half billion dollars, 
yet at that time, it was not possible 
to find among all of the earth’s 
poor, six poorer men. “None but 
women in the life boats” sounded 
the crack of doom for these men. 
For, in spite of their immense 
wealth 

The shades of life had fallen , 

And the hour had come to die. 

The rich left all they had, the 
poor had nothing to leave. 

“Get out—none but women in 
the boat.” 

“Will you please let me remain 
to care for my wife?” said a mul¬ 
timillionaire. 

“Get out.” 

He climbed back onto the sink¬ 
ing deck and in a few brief, anxious 
moments the earth with its hopes 
and fears faded forever from his 
vision. 

What a lesson is here taught! 
How fleeting is wealth; “how transi¬ 
tory are human things.” 

The Titanic has broken the 
world's record as the largest, finest 
ship that ever floated; she carried 
the biggest passenger list repre¬ 
senting the largest aggregation of 
wealth that ever assembled on 
a similar occassion; going down she 
made practically a clean sweep 
of her millionaire male passengers. 
Her record staggered the world 
and bathed it in tears; the whole 
human family is akin.
