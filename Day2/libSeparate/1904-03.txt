weekly. the firesides of thousands of 
struggling colored families, inspiring 
with hope, nerving them to greater en¬ 
deavors, and giving direction to their 
upward movement. Surely Dr. Scott is 
an instrument in God’s hands for the 
religious and moral elevation of his peo¬ 
ple. Besides his worth as a man and 
Christian, he is the greatest negro edi¬ 
tor in the country. 

In the solution of color prejudice in 
religious circles the M. E. church has 
taken high and advanced ground by 
pbcing all of its devotees in the line 
of promotion to the highest gifts at its 
disposal. Like the Great Teacher, it has 
said by this action: “Him that cometh 
unto me, I will in no wise cast out.” 


BISHOP I. B. SCOTT. 

The election of Dr. I. B. Scott, editor 
of the Southwestern Christian Advo¬ 
cate, as Missionary Bishop, is a fitting 
reward for the ability and meritorious 
service of a great man. In this action 
the General Conference conferred upon 
itself as well as Dr. Scott, a lasting hon¬ 
or. By it the members of the Gener¬ 
al Conference of the great M. E. church 
have proven themselves worthy succes¬ 
sors of immortal wesley. Dr. Scott is 
pre-eminently fitted for the great office. 
He is broad, scholarly, conservative, 
possessing the elements necessary tt* 
leadership to an eminent degree. As 
editor of the Southwestern Christian 
Advocate he has rendered to the church 
his race and the country a service that 
cannot be estimated in figures. He made

There is land and urgent need for a

who will enter the field a fortune awaits. 
Land can be leased or purchased on 
easy terms, which can be paid for by 
sale of crops in two to five years. By 
locating in the cities the colored people 
who come here are making a mistake.

city will cost $2500, and yields no in¬

THE LIBERATOR. 



Mr. R. R. Robinson, of Jacksonville, 
Fla., president of the only railroad own¬ 
ed and controlled by colored people, 
gave the Forum an interesting talk con¬ 
cerning the building of the railroad of 
which he is president and originator. 
Mr. Robinson is not an orator, but a 
business man pure and simple. His 
talk before the Forum was one of the 
most practical ever listened f(p by that 
body. _ The story of his struggles in 
the railroad project is another case in 
which truth is stranger than fiction. He 
brought out in his talk some vcxy im¬ 
portant facts and things that the negro 
can remember with profit, viz: that 
when the negro shows a disposition to 
do something, the white people, regard¬ 


less of politics or section, will lend him 
a helping hand. That the negro must 
cultivate the friendship of his white 
neighbors, and farther, that in local poli¬ 
tics must support those friendly to him 
regardless of party. That a Democratic 
friend in your City Council is better 
than an enemy in your own political 
party. In other words, if the negro 
takes an independent stand in politics 
he can secure from the men in power 
their aid for the promotion of his busi¬ 
ness projects. It was the independent 
Democrats in the Jacksonville City 
Council that granted the negroes their 
railroad franchise in recognition of the 
fact that the colored voters were intel¬ 
ligent enough to vote for them in the 
interest of good government. 


less of the color of its promoters.. There 
is room here for a first-class hotel, drug 
store, shoe and dry goods store, all to 
be conducted by colored men. There 
is also room for another colored den¬ 
tist—a capable, broad, progressive, posi¬ 
tive man. 


A Hotel Needed. A hotel run on the 
European plan is badly needed bv the 
colored people of this city. There is a 
fortune in it for the man, or men, who 
will take advantage of the opportunity 
that is now going a begging. A lot 
close in should be purchased, and a 
modern three or four-story building 
erected, with wall sufficiently strong to 
have other stories added as the business 
demands. Under this 'should be a col¬ 


ored drug store and first-class bakery 
and confectionery; also a shoe store 
with physician and dental offices above. 
Such a* enterprise, conducted on first- 
class flSsts, and catering to first-class 
people of all races would be a success 
from the start. Colored business men 
here encounter no race prejudice. The 
white people are liberty loving, pro¬ 
gressive, liberal, always ready to en¬ 
courage any laudable enterprise regard¬ 


COLORED PEOPLE LEAVING THE 
DELTA. 

Hon. L. C. Dulaney, of Issaquena, one 
of the most prominent planters in the 
delta, attributes the scarcity of labor 
in Mississippi to the agitation of the 
negro question during the past year, 
the seeming attitude of hostility toward 
the race and the opposition to negro 
education, which had its first actual 
demonstration in Governor Vardaman’s 
veto of the appropriation for the Negro 
Normal School at Holly Springs. 

Mr. Dulaney states that the labor 
^nrcity is ^ot due to the fret that the 
negroes will not accept work so much 
as i is to the steady tide of negro emi¬ 
gration from the state. Members of 
the race who have grown restive on 
account of the attempt to deprive them 
of educational advantages are leaving 
the state in large numbers, and among 
these are many good, hard-working, 
law-abiding colored people, who have 
moved to other southern states where 
the hostility toward the race is not so 
apparent; 

This is strong confirmation of the 
statement made by Bishop Galloway in 
his address before the educational con¬ 
ference at Birmingham, Ala., recently, 
wherein he said that there are very few 
negroes in Mississippi who would not 
sell their property and leave the state 
if they could get a fair valuation for it. 
There are several notable instances in 
Jackson where well-to-do negroes have 
sold their property with the intention 
of leaving the state. One negro dis¬ 
posed of his holdings a few days since 
for $5000 and is preparing to move to 
Oklahoma. 

The new Wells vagrancy law, a 
measure which will undoubtedly have 
a salutary effect among the lawless 
and loafing elements of the race, is 
cordially indorsed by the better class 
of colored people, and it has not con¬ 
tributed in any way to the deep-seated 
feeling of unrest which is now so vis¬ 
ibly manifesting itself. Inquiry at the 
ticket offices of the railroad companies 
shows that the bulk of their pleasure 
journeyings on Saturday and Sunday 
of each week, is to points outside of the 
state. It is undoubtedly true that the 
negroes are steadily moving out.

It is feared that the old bird has struck

honorable “p. o.” Blair will pungle uo

his theories. Blair has a hard job, but 
it is hb own selection.

SAWTELLE. 

The building boom in Sawtelle con¬ 
tinues unabated. There are at least io 
new cottages in the course of erection. 
The brick block to be occupied Dy -tw« 
Sawtelle Bank and Pacific Land Co. will 
soon be < conipletel The Los Angeles 
and Pacific R. R. will erect a handsome 
new station. Property of all kinds has 
advanced a hundred per cent in value 
in the past two years. Land that sold 
two years ago for $175 per acre brings 
readily at this time $350 per acre. 

Sawtelle is not enjoying what may be 
called a boom, but the activity in its 
real estate market is based upon the 
actual value of its soil and superb lo¬ 
cation. Being the site of the National 
Soldiers’ Home, its streets are enliven¬ 
ed each day by hundreds of visitors 
from all parts of the United States. 

The area in truck gardening is rapid¬ 
ly increasing. The fertilty and pro¬ 


ductiveness of the soil, its frostless win¬ 
ters and splendid market makes truck 
gardening a profitable business for its 
industrious farmer. Strawberries and 
all kinds of vegetables are grown the 
year round.

SAWTELLE BREVITIES. 

Mr. Chas. Brooks, Sr. has completed 
his 5 room cottage on Colorado and 
Fourteenth St., and will occupy it about 
June xst. 

The cottage of Mr. E. M. Brooks 
on Iowa and Thirteenth is nearing com¬ 
pletion, and will be occupied about 
July 15th. The cost of the material 
used in its erection will be about $1800. 
The money invested in Sawtelle proper¬ 
ty by the Brookses will reach $4500. 
Mr. T. Stricklin, a wealthy hotel man 
of Natchez, Miss., spent several days 
here as the guest of Mr. Chas. Brooks. 

Prof. J. Ross of Natchez, Miss., and 


Mr. Collins, a wealthy citizen of Gulf 
Port, Miss., and Rev. E. W. Mosely, of 
the C. M. E. church, all delegates to the 
General Conference, were visitors at the 
Edmunds’ Villa. After luncheon they 
were taken for a drive through the 
beautiful gardens and berry fields. As 
these gentlemen are all Mississippiams, 
their visit here was a Mississippi re¬ 
union. Elder Mosely is Fraternal Dele¬ 
gate to the M. E. General Conference 
from the C. M. E. church. 

Rev. Mosely and the editor of this jour¬ 
nal have been warm friends since the 
seventies, Rev. Mosely having been 
prominent in church, educational and 
social circles for many years. Besides a 
splendid home in Jackson, Term., he 
owns a valuable farm near that city and 
has led his people along industrial as 
well as moral and religious lines. He 
is a leader eloquent of speech, eloquent 
in moral worth and eloquent in exam¬ 
ples. These gentlemen will pay Saw¬ 
telle another visit before leaving for the 
far away sunny south. 

Mrs. L. L. Stewart, of 822 Central 
Ave. is a guest at the Edmunds’ Villa,, 
where she will remain until their cot¬ 
tage on 36th St. in Los Angeles is erect¬ 
ed. Since coming to Sawtelle she has 
completely recovered her health, which 
has been poor for some time. 

The Free Methodists have just com¬ 
pleted their handsome new church on 
Sixth street. Sixth street, near the rail¬ 
road, now has three churches—the Free 
Methodist, Baptist and Seventh Day 
Adventists. These, with the school 
house, make that part of Sixth street 
the religious and educational center of 
the town. Sawtelle has seven churches. 

Mrs. Mason Reed put a sign: “For 
Sale” in front of her beautiful cottage 
on seventh street, offering the place 
for $1000. She was surprised when, a 
few days afterwards, a lady called with 
$1000 in gold for the place. She looked 
at the gold, and then the place, and sent 
the lady and the gold away. Moral: 
Don’t advertise Sawtelle property for 
sale until you are ready to sell it.

For Vice-President, 

Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, of California, 
or 

Governor Durbin, of Indiana, 


GOV. BLANCHARD. 

In his inaugural address, Governor 
Blanchard of Louisiana said: "The ne¬ 
gro is here. He is a man and a citizen. 
He is useful and valuable in his sphere. 
Within that sphere he must be guar¬ 
anteed equal protection of the law, and 
his education along proper lines— 
mainly agricultural and industrial—is 
at once a duty and a necessity. He must 
be protected in his right to live peace¬ 
ably and quietly; in his right to labor 
and enjoy the fruits of his labor.” The 
above declarations touching the solution 
of the race problem makes Governor 
Blanchard at once the foremost man in 
the South—a leader around whom the 
progressive, liberty-loving, law-abiding 
white men of the South can and will 
gather. He recognizes three facts—the 
complete acknowledgement of which is 
not only vital to the negro, but to the 
peace and prosperity of the South. The 
negro is a man and citizen. His rights 
as such must be respected; he is indis¬ 
pensable to the material progress of the 


South. Let the South leave the negro 
free to enjoy these rights and the race 
problem will have been practically 
solved. Give him the same chance and 
the same education given the white 
man—the negro asks for nothing more; 
it is unfair and unmanly to grant him 
less. Contrast the noble utterances of 
Governor Blanchard with the mouthings 
of Senator Tillman, Governor Varda¬ 
nian and Thomas Nelson Page and you 
have on one hand the statesman, on the 
the other the most dangerous dema¬ 
gogues. Governor Blanchard has 
sounded the bugle blast for a forward 
movement that will be beard fioni one 
end of this country to the other. "Mob 
law in contravention and defiance of 
law will not be tolerated. Lynchings 
will not be permitted under any circum¬ 
stances,” says this great man and Gov¬ 
ernor. These utterances are manly, no¬ 
ble and patriotic. How unlike Gover¬ 
nor Vardanian, whose intemperate, 
treasonable appeals to passion and race 
hatred applied the torch to innocent 
men and women, and then had to spend 
the state’s money to put it out. Thank 
God for Roosevelt and Blanchard; a 
President whose integrity fits him to 
rule any nation; a governor that would 
do credit to any state. 


DR. SHUMPERT. 

Among the distinguished ministers and 
scholars we have had the good fortune 
to meet since the convening of the 
General Conference, none afforded us 
greater pleasure than our meeting with 
Dr. J. M. Shumpert, of Columbus, Mis¬ 
sissippi. He is presiding elder of that 
district, having served ill that capacity 
for 24 years. During the winter of 
1874-5 we attended the Union Academy 
of Columbus, and while there came in 
touch with tlje financial, social and po¬ 
litical leaders of the county. Dr. 
Shumpert brings us the first direct tid¬ 
ings we have received from our friends 
in that city and neighborhood for 28 
years. Through him we had a pleas¬ 
ant reunion with friends of long ago. 
After an absence of 28 years from the 
scenes of one’s boyhood, with all com¬ 
munications severed, to meet a friend 
fresh from the arena of former strug¬ 
gles, with tidings from friends that are 
living and stories of those that are dead, 
produces a feeling of pleasure and re¬ 
gret that cannot be described. 

Crawford, our home, is a village 18 
miles from Columbus, the county seat 
of Lowndes county. As Columbus was 
the center of education and culture of 
the county, the young men and women 
of country districts who desir'd social 
standing had to attend the Union Acad¬ 
emy at least one term. The same was 
true of the white people. All of the 
county officers had to live in Columbus, 
or enjoy the shades of a private life. 

Dr. Shumpert has rendered valuable 
services not only to his church, but his 
race. He is well preserved and looks 
as well as he did 20 years ago. 


"Watch us grow” is one of the sig¬ 
nificant sentences printed over the front 
of the great Broadway Department 
Store. Those who have watched have 
not been disappointed. In the grow¬ 
ing process this store has outgrown any 
similar establishment in Southern Cali¬ 
fornia. This is due to fair treatment 
of all patrons by the proprietor and 
managers, and the public spirit shown 
by the maintenance by this store of a 
school for the free education of the 
boys and girls in its employ. Seats are 
arranged behind the counters where the 
salesladies may sit and rest when not 
busy, the health and comfort of the 
employes being carefully looked after. 

It is gratifying to note that this store 
has a large colored trade. The encour¬ 
agement its managers have given the 
colored people and their enterprises en¬ 
title them to a large share of the col¬ 
ored trade. This store gives employ¬ 
ment to four colored persons—one ele¬ 
vator man (Mr. J. FT. Garrott), one 
matron, one janitor and one boy. This 
is friendship that befriends. Some 
friends are friendly only in words. The 
firm that gives you a chance to earn a 
dollar, gives you a chance to save a 
dollar. Don’t forget them when you 
have to spend a dollar. 


It is a source of sincere regret that 
the colored people are allowing all of 
the valuable agricultural lands to pass 
from their reach. Acreage property 
that could have been purchased two 
years ago for $175 is selling now for 
$350 per acre, and hard to get at that 
price. The colored people will have to 
own something more than a few houses 
and lots if they hope to hold their own 
or he a factor in Southern California, or 
anywhere else. 


Mr. R. H. Dunston, proprietor of the 
L. A. Van & Storage Co., has been elect¬ 
ed a member of the Chamber of Com¬ 
merce. He is one of the most suc- 
successful transfer men in the 
city. Commencing a few years 
ago with a one-horse wagon, he 
is now at the head of one of the larg¬ 
est transfer companies in the citv. 
His election is an inspiration to the 
colored business men of the city, of 
which Mr. Dunston is the best pro¬ 
duct. In honoring him the Chamber of 
Commerce has. honored the entire race 
in the city and this aclion will stimulate 
every deoartment of business activity 
among the colored citizens. It says to 
them that the business men of this city 
are not unmindful of the progress they 
are making and stand ready to encour¬ 
age every effort for business achieve¬ 
ments. Mr. Dunston is a quiet, modest, 
unassuming gentleman, who takes deep 
interest in all matters pertaining to the 
advancement of the race.

DR. KILGO RINGS THE NOTE OF 
WARNING. 

An Eloquent Plea for Law and Order. 

“The rapid growth of mobocracy is 
an alarming malady which cannot _ be 
cured unless there be a mighty quick¬ 
ening of the conscience and strength¬ 
ening * of ■ the moral integrity of this 
nation. Its growth is a sure sign of 
moral degeneracy, and this is true, 
whether the aim of the mob be to wreak 
vengeance for a horrible crime, to vent 
an insane passion, to enforce a labor 
union’s demand, to carry an election by 
fraud and intimidation, to force an opin¬ 
ion by boycott and persecution, or to 
forestall justice by inflammatory appeals 
to human passions. All are forms of 
mobocracy, which, in essence, is anar¬ 


chy. It is American freedom pushed to 
American defiances.” 

Dr. Kilgo is from North Carolina, and 
is attending the General Conference of 
the M. E. church as fraternal delegate 
from the M. E. Church South.

BATON ROUGE, La., May 16.—In 
the presence of a multitude gathered 
in the grounds of the State Capitol 
today, Newton C. Blanchard was in¬ 
augurated Governor. In his inaugural 
address Governor Blanchard said: 

“Mob law in contravention and defi¬ 
ance of law will not be tolerated. 
Lynchings will not be permitted, un¬ 
der any circumstances. 

“The negro is here. He is a man and 
a citizen. He is useful and valuable in 
his sphere. Within that sphere he must 
be guaranteed equal protection of the 
law, and his education along proper 
lines—mainly agricultural and indus¬ 
trial—is at once a duty and a. neces¬ 
sity. He must be protected in his right 
to live peaceably and^ quietly; in his 
right to labor and enjoy the fruits of 
his labor. He must be encouraged to 
industry and taught habits of thrift 

“No approach toward social equality 
or social recognition will ever be tol¬ 
erated in Louisiana. Separate schools, 
separate churches, separate cars, sep¬ 
arate places of entertainment will be 
enforced. Racial distinction and in¬ 
tegrity must be preserved. But there 
is room enough, in this broad South¬ 
land, with proper lines of limitations 
and demarkation, for the two races to 
live on terms of mutual trust, mutual 
help, good understanding and concord. 

“The South asserts its ability to 
handle and solve the negro question on 
humanitarian lines—those of justice 
and of right. We brook no interference 
from without.”

THL LIB ORATOR. 


THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT STILL AGAINST 
THE NEGROES. 

The Virginia suffrage case has been 
dismissed by the United States Supreme 
Court upon a technicality. The con¬ 
stitutionality of the unconstitutional, 
constitutions of Mississippi and 
Alabama having been sustained by 
the highest court in the land, it now 
remains for the revolutionary constitu¬ 
tions of Louisiana and North Carolina 
to reach that body and receive its en¬ 
dorsement. No one acquainted with that 
court’s dealings with the negro is in 
the least surprised. When the negro’s 
rights are involved, an argument before 
that body is a prodigal waste of time. 
A Negro has a better show of getting 
justice in a magistrate’s court in Missis¬ 
sippi than he has before the republican 
Supreme Court of the United States. 
God is not dead. Either every man 
will enjoy his constitutional rights re¬ 
gardless of race or color, or the Re¬ 
public will fall. 


The Negro who pretends that the suc¬ 
cess. of the race depends upon the orga¬ 


nization of political clubs is a job chaser 
that bears watching; he is not only a 
self seeker but an impediment in the 
path of race progress, and should be set 
down upon heavily. Those who aspire 
to leadership must possess something 
more than a thirst for office. 

Leaders who have made a success in 
keeping off the tax roll need to be led. 
If the negro hopes to succeed in this 
country he has got to do things just as 
white men do^ require the same 
qualifications for leaders that white men 
require. The men who lead the white 
people possess something more than 
their hats and the negro will have to 
demand the same kind of leadership. 
The white carpet-baggers have all been 
put to work, and the negro carpet-bag¬ 
gers should profit by their example.

the letters we received from Master 
William, together with his cut, as soon 


as we receive his picture. Our read¬ 
ers will be pleased to know something 
of this big New York boy. With the 
service of a hundred boys like William, 
The Liberator could be made the great¬

have a boy down in Mississippi who ha-

Among those we were fortunate to 
meet was Prof. E. H. McKissack , A. M. 
of Holly Springs, Mississippi, Professor 
of Natural Science, Rust University. 
Aside from his position as instructor 
in that University, he is identified with 
and a prime promoter of many mer¬ 
cantile and benevolent enterprises ot 
his stale. He is.secretary of the Odd 
Fellows’ Association, which pays $so,oco 
a year to widows and orphans in Miss, 
lie is a stock holder in the M. & F. 
bank of Mississippi, and an oil mill and 
ice factory. He is also a successful real 
estate dealer.

THE LIBERATOR. 



God’s own country, breathes the purest 
of California air, drinks the clearest of 
artesian water, his children have the 
benefit of the best schools, Uncle Sam 
delivers mail to him twice each day, and 
if he is not happy it is his own fault 
and not the fault of these gentlemen 
who have placed a home within his 
reach. There are many industrial en¬ 
terprises, but none appeal so strongly to 
the wage earner as the one the project¬ 
ors of this plan of $i.oo dpwn and $1.00 
per week have originated. It is the 
first step towards the purest type of 
democracy. It means the freedom of 
the wage earner from the crowded and 
unhealthy city home; it means that the 
wife and family can have their suburban 
home as well as the wife and family of 
the millionaire. If you do not care to 
take advantage of this opportunity, it 
certainly must appeal very strongly to 
the major portion of the population of 
this city, and it certainly deserves the 
investigation of every wage earner who 
expects to own his own home. Do not 
delay. See us at once for full partic¬ 
ulars.

AN UNPARALLELED .. .. 
OPPORTUNITY 

Is offered through the agency of the 
Golden State Realty Investment Co., 
430 Bryson Block, corner Second and 
Spring streets. The organizers of this 
corporation have recognized the fact 
that no opportunity has been gt/en 
the wage-earner to buy good property 
accessible to car lines at reasonable 
prices and on easy payments. They have 
opened up, within the last sixty days, 
over one thousand building lots, all of 
which have been snapped up by the 
wage earners of Los Angeles and vicin¬ 
ity. Their plan is so simple that it ap¬ 
peals immediately to any man who earns 
a weekly salary. One dollar down and 
$i.oo per week on each lot, without anv 
interest or taxes to pay. Just think of 
it! A man with only $10 a week in¬ 
come can within two years own his own 
property. This is made possible by the 
fact that he can buy a $90 lot from the 
Golden State Realty Investment Co., 
paying $1.00 down and pay $1.00 each 


for the advancement of Wesley M. E. 
Church, he being president of ine boerr! 
of Trustees. He has done much to 
preserve the gcod name of the race by 
lending his influence to those who stood 
for progress and higher morality. 


week thereafter for 88 weeks. On the 
completion of these payments the com¬ 
pany will give him a good and suffi¬ 
cient title, deeding to him the lot which 
he has purchased, and given unlimited 
certificate of title. There are many mir¬ 
acles being worked out today by the 
business and financial interests of the 
country, but none appeals so strongly to 
every one as this proposition of placing 
a home within the reach of every fam¬ 
ily, no matter how limited their means 
niaj r be. Every lot sold by the Golden 
Stale Realty Investment Co. is on the 
direct line of the Huntington Electric 
Railway system, claimed by every one 
to be the best interurban system in the 
world. Take, for instance, these new 
lots at Watt’s Station, on the Long 
Beach line. Our friend, the wage earner, 
can buy one of these lots, keep up his 
weekly payments, and live on the lot 
in the meantime. No bogy man of a 
tax collector; no shylock to collect in¬ 
terest from him, and for $4.00 each 
month he lives in the finest part of 


A DISTINGUISHED DELEGATION. 

The colored delegation which is at¬ 
tending the General Conference here 13 
by far the most distinguished body of 
colored men that ever assembled in this 
or any other city in the Union. Among 
them are ministers and educators of 
national fame, prominent lawyers, suc¬ 
cessful business men and railroad mag¬ 
nates. In short, the members of the 
delegation represents every department 
of American business and Ameircan ac¬ 
tivity. They are wot only a credit to 
their race and the Conference, but to 
the states that produce them. A race 
that can produce such specimens of dig¬ 
nified manhood has endless possibilities. 
The visit of these gentlemen win prow 
a source of lasting inspiration to their 
brethren on this side of the rockies. It 
also gives our white fellow citizens and 
friends a better idea of the negro's abil¬ 
ity to be and do things. The race here 
have frequently suffered by the presence 
of a horde of irresponsible drifting 
negroes that possessed no ambition to 
rise higher than the position of a hewer 
of wood and a drawer of water. Such 
negroes are always in the public eye. 
In point of able, dignified, manly leaders 
our brethren of the south are truly blest, 
and, in spite of the prejudices and dis¬ 
criminations that surround and impede 
their progress a splendid destiny awaits 
them. A merciful providence is fighting 
our battles.

A Member of the Firm, Mr. L. L. 
Stewart, who is an employ of the South¬ 
western Lumber Co., takes as much in¬ 
terest in advancing its interests as 
though he was a member of the firm. 
He has been active in securing the pa¬ 
tronage for the company of the colored 
people who are building homes. In the 
past two months he has sold $iooo 
worth of lumber to colored men. He 
sold to the Brooks Bros. $900 worth and 
has prospective sales that will amount 
to $5000. This company is one of the 
most reliable in the city. The fact that 
it employs colored men should com¬ 
mend it to the colored people of the 
city and vicinity in need of building 
material. The example set by Mr. 
Stewart should be adopted by all color¬ 
ed employes.

The Fact That J. J. Neimore has 
joined the “Easton push” is joyfully 
hailed as proof that the Liberator has 
killed the pestiferous “old six bits push.’’ 
It is feared, however, that the last state 
of the man will be worse than the first. 
It looks as if there will be a “push” 
within a “push.” And as this new push 
threatens to destroy itself, it looks as if 
the energies of the Liberator can be de¬ 
voted to the material advancement of 
the race. However, the people expect 
The Liberator to keep one eye on 
this new element of danger so that it 
may be prevented from doing violence 
to their well being.

Col. Melvin Mudge lias gone east on 
a year's visit, leaving his residence in 
charge of Attorney and Mrs. Eugene 
Marshall. Since the death of Mrs. 
Mudge, which occurred some months 
ago, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall have oc¬ 
cupied the Mudge home. The Colonel 
speaks in highest terms of Mr. and Mrs. 
Marshall, especially Mr. Marshall's abil¬ 
ity as an attorney. The Colonel is a 
civil war veteran and a member of the 
old school of Republicanism, an uncom¬ 
promising supporter of equal rights for 
all, and believes in equal opportunities 
for all. The editor of this journal serv¬ 
ed as a member of the Grand Jury with 
Colonel Mudge during the term of 1902 
and 1903. When Col. Mudge was ap¬ 
pointed Chairman of the committee to 
visit the Whittier Reform school and 
the. County Poor Farm he made the 
editor of this journal secretary of the 
committee, making it his duty to draw 
up the committee’s report on the condi¬ 
tion of these institutions.

warmly applauded by his appreciative 
audience. President Dogan is a Mis-
