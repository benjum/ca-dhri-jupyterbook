Uniter* States Senator John D. Works Will Not Vote 

For President Taft. 


WILL VOTE FOR WILSON. 


WORKS HITS BACK. 


Washington, July 20. 

“Hon. A. J. Wallace, Laughlin 
building, Los Angeles: 

“Will not vote for Taft. Would 
have voted for and aided in election 
of Roosevelt if he had stood on his 
just right to the nomination at Chi¬ 
cago and run as a Republican. 
Will not follow him into a new 
party. I believe the new party 
abandons ground that would make 
his claim invulnerable. Do not 
believe in new party now or under 
existing circumstances. Believe it 
will result in complication dis¬ 
astrous to progressive cause. 
Whether I vote for Roosevelt now 
depends on how he is nominated and 
whether he runs as Republican 
or not. Have not determined 
whether will vote for Wilson or 
not. If I cannot conscienciously 
vote for Roosevelt I feel I can as 
progressive Republican, vote for 
Wilson consistently if no Repub¬ 
lican other than Taft is a candi¬ 
date. 

(Signed) 

“JOHN D. WORKS.” 


WHO WILL GET STONEWALL? 

Stonewall Jackson, the crack col¬ 
ored sprinter of Citrus Union High 
School, is going to enter a college 
or university this fall. Every col¬ 
lege in the South wants him, and if 
any one of them has ever drawn 
the color line, it will undraw it if 
he knocks at the door. He is a 
prize worth going after, for he 
showed in the national interschol¬ 
astic meet at Chicago that he was 


the best high school sprinter in 
the country.—The L. A. Times. 


MUCH WORK FOR THE FED¬ 
ERATION TO DO 


The Womens Clubs have un¬ 
doubtedly accomplished much for 
the uplift of our people since 
their organization, but the crust 
of the work to be done has not 
been broken. The clubs are now 
mainly in the “essay” stage— 
in other words their work consists 
largely in meeting in churches or 
well appointed homes to read es¬ 
says on the needs of the struggling 
women and unfortunate children 
of the slums, while this class is 
left to its fate. If the unfortunate 
women and children of the race 
are to be benefitted by the exist¬ 
ence of the clubs, the club women 
will have to become plainly but 
neatly dressed women —mothers 
who will visit the women and 
children of the slums greeting them 
with a smile of good cheer. 

Mother’s meetings will have to 
be held in such communities and 
the women of such communities 
taught in a sisterly way the im¬ 
portance of properly caring for 
their children and homes. They 
must be taught the importance of 
sending their children to school, 
and that no matter how plainly 
they are dressed, so they are neat 
and clean. The girls should be 
taught the duties of home-keep¬ 
ing, should be well supplied with 
good books and encouraged to 
remain at home in the evenings 
and read them. The women who 
most need the services of the 
clubs will never attend their ses¬ 


sions as they are now held. For 
this they cannot be blamed, as 
the sessions look too much like 
a fashion show. This is a case 
where “Mohammed” will have to 
go to the mountain. In our visits 
about the city, we are simply 
astounded at the amount of work 
that needs to be done among our 
people. We find hundreds of 
bright little boys and girls confined 
to small, cheerless yards with no 
opportunity for physical or other 
development. We also find hun¬ 
dreds of boys and girls who never 
read a book or paper. If the club 
women really want to do the 
work of mercy and uplift where 
it needs to be done, we can point 
them to a score of virgin fields 
in this city. What many of our 
colored women need to know is 
not how to dress themselves and 
their daughters finely, but how 
to dress neatly and economically. 
It would not be a bad idea to 
teach the people that dressing extrav¬ 
agantly on a small salary is taken as 
a sign of immorality; that if the soul is 
properly arrayed, the body will 
show it. And that an educated 
young woman plainly dressed is 
worth a score of mentally un¬ 
cultivated young women dressed 
in the latest style. Give us less 
of the superficial and more of the 
genuine work of the uplift. What 
the race needs today and for the 
future is men and ^women. To 
aid in [such an uplift is our pur¬ 
pose.

THE GREAT GET TOGETHER 
BANQUET 


THE PEOPLE’S LYCEUM 


Will Give a Grand Banquet to the 
Business and Professional People 
of Los Angeles and Vicinity on :: :: 
TUESDAY EVE., JULY 30th. 


Wesley M. E. Church, Cor. 8th 
and San Julian Streets 

The object of the banquet will 
be to bring our people into closer 
business and social relations, in 
order that race enterprises may be 
stimulated and encouraged. What 
is needed to bring about a con¬ 
centration of the Negro’s ener¬ 
gies and means for the general 
advancement of all, is better un¬ 
derstanding of the benefits to be 
derived from building up a busi¬ 
ness and professional class. 

A seat has been reserved for you.

KAPPA GAMMA SORORITY 


This Sorority was recently or¬ 
ganized by fourteen young girls 
of the social set of the city. The 
following officers were installed by 
the Priest Ex-Officio, Father W. T. 
Cleghorn: Misses Eleanor McClel¬ 
lan, Pres.; Mamie Lovett, Vice 
Pres.; Viola Spence, Secy; Marie 
Wrenn, Treas.; Evely Dulany, Crit¬ 
ic. Other members are Misses 
Ella Dulany, Harriett Ivy, Con- 
suelo Jones, Valerie Kemp, Fannie 
McLemore, Alma Simmons, Homer 
Stapler, Rosetta Warner and Bessie 
Williams. Matrons Mrs, A. V. 
Childress, C. A. Murdock and S. 
W. Thompson. The following 
were also present to take part of 
the dainty refreshments: Messrs. 
Cunningham, Scott, Gray, Fred 
Scott, Pollock, Cloyd, Garnell and 
Wilkinson. 


THE M. and K. BANQUET 


The banquet given on last Fri¬ 
day evening by the Missouri and 
Kansas Club was by far the largest 
and swellest entertainment of the 
kind ever given by the colored 
people in the city. There were 
fully two hundred banqueters in 
the hall. An excellent program, 
consisting of music and short ad¬ 
dresses was rendered. The songs 
by the M. and K. trio was one of 
the most entertaining features of 
the program. Mr. W. T. Pat¬ 
terson, master of ceremonies, de¬ 
livered an amusing welcome ad¬ 
dress, responded to by Mr. S. P. 
Johnson, on behalf of the club. 
Capt. F. H. Crumbly responded 
in behalf of other State clubs; this 
was followed by the presentation 
of presents to the president and 
secretary for efficient service. 
These presents consisted of hand¬ 
some cut glass dishes. 

At the close of the program an 
elaborate luncheon was served. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


Rev. Danly, of Pasadena, filled 
the pulpit at Wesley M. E. church 
last Sunday and preached an in¬ 
teresting sermon. After the ser¬ 
mon, Revs. Danley and Kinchen 
were the guests of Mr. and Mrs. 
E. G. Hill. 


Mr. William Roberts, one of our 
brightest and most practical 
young men, is back from his ranch. 
Although a college man, Mr. Rob¬ 
erts is actively engaged in carving 
a ranch out of the desert. With 
axe, pick and shovel, he is making 
a part of the desert bud and 
blossom as a rose. Mr. Roberts 
has the right idea of an education. 


Miss L. H. Boyd, of San Antonio, 
Texas, is the guest of Mr. and Mrs. 
I. B. Warren, 1957 Maple Ave. 


The State Federation of Wom¬ 
ens Clubs will convene in this 
city on the 31st. Elaborate prep¬ 
arations have been made by the 
local clubs for their entertainment. 
The Federation will hold its ses¬ 
sions at Wesley M. E. Church. 


WILL GIVE PRIZE FOR THE 
BEST KEPT GROUNDS 


Mr. Noah D. Thompson, the 
enterprising grocer of the Furlong 
Tract, 55th and Long Beach Ave., 
will give a prize to the young 
person who has the best kept 
yard and grounds in the tract 
next Thanksgiving day. This is 
a move in the right direction and 
will add much to the already 
beautiful surroundings in the tract. 
By cultivating in the minds of 
the young people a taste for neat 
surroundings, Mr. Thompson is 
a real benefactor to his community. 
His grocery store is one of the 
neatest and best kept in the city. 
He is an old Tuskegeean and the 
Tuskegee idea pervades every¬ 
thing. 


MR. TYLER WILL SPEAK 

Attorney Willis 0. Tyler will 
address the Lyceum next Sunday, 
the 28th. You are invited.

MISS PERRY AT THE CLUB 


Thursday, July 18th, the mem¬ 
bers of the Booker T. Washington 
Art Club were entertained by Mrs. 
R. C. Bell at her residence, 1540 
W. 36th Street. The afternoon 
was socially spent, most of the 
time being devoted to needle work 
and conversation. The club had 
the pleasure of the presence of 
little Miss Alberta Perry, the little 
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. S. 
Perry, and the 3 r oungest member 
of the Booker T. Washington Art 
Club. Light refreshments were 
served, after which the club ad¬ 
journed. The next meeting will 
be at the residence of Mrs. Givens 
on East 32nd Street. 


A surprise in the form of a baby 
shower was given Mrs. R. Reecl, 
of East Hollywood, Thursday, 
July 11th, by the members of the 
Booker T. Washington Art Club. 
The afternoon was pleasantly 
spent in a social way. Mrs. Reed 
was the recipient of many pretty 
and useful presents. 


If rumors are true, Cupid has 
been very busy with his bow and 
arrow. One of his darts has 
found a victim in the midst of the 
Booker T. Washington Art Club 
and pierced the heart of one of our 
most promising young ladies. 
Listen for the wedding bells. 

The West End correspondent 
for The Liberator humbly begs the 
Editor for this little space in which 
to ask the pardon of little miss 
Perry, because of his unmanly 
neglect to write an account of 
her arrival. Dear little girl, I 
did not mean to be negligent. 
If you knew how glad we are to 
have you, you would overlook our 
mistakes. If you will forgive me 
this time, I will go forth and sin 
no more. 


Mr. and Mrs. W. W. Cobb are 
entertaining, as house guest, Mrs. 
Thompson, of Phoenix, Arizona.

SENATOR WORKS AND THE 
PROGRESSIVES 


The bomb thrown into the ranks 
of the progressives by U. S. Sena¬ 
tor Works, has created wide¬ 
spread consternation. And the 
Johnson-Lissner machine is in need 
of immediate repairs or the whole 
wretched thing will go to pieces. 
Although people may differ with 
Senator Works in some of his 
views, all must admit that he is 
conscientous and absolutely hon¬ 
est. The rapidity with which Cal¬ 
ifornians are flocking to his stand¬ 
ard, means one of two things and 
that is that the electoral vote of 


California will go to President 
Taft or Governor Wilson. The 
attempt of the Johnson-Lissner 
machine to use the Republican 
machinery of this State, after leav¬ 
ing the party to elect a third party 
candidate to the presidency, was 
too much for a statesman of 
Senator Works’ caliber. This 
wholesale attempt to cheat the 
Republicans of this state out of 
the results of their franchise will 
result in many surprises at the 
coming primaries. 


EVERY BUSINESS AND PRO¬ 
FESSIONAL PERSON TO BE 
PRESENT 


It is of the utmost importance 
for every business and professional 
colored man and woman to attend 
the Banquet in person or by proxy. 
As the object of the Banquet is to 
bring the professional and lay- 
members of the race together, 
for the mutual advancement of 
both. The Negroes of this city 
need to build up a business and 
professional class. They need a 
professional class to guard their 
moral, physical and legal inter¬ 
ests. They need a business class 
to handle their business interests, 
finance their commercial schemes 
and furnish employment for the 
young people that our public 
schools are turning out. When 
the Negro fully understands the 
needs and value of such a class, 
they will give the support neces¬ 
sary to make it possible. 

We trust that the ministers will 
not only encourage the members of 
their several churches to take part 
in this, their first get-together- 
banquet, but will be present them¬ 
selves and thus show their interest 
in the welfare of the people that 
is sought to be advanced by the 
banquet. Of course every busi¬ 
ness and professional man and 
woman will be present, as their 
absence will make an unfavorable 
impression. They certainly can be 
present in person or by proxy, each 
of whom will be introduced to 
the assemblage. 


IMPORTANT NOTICE 


The Lyceum’s Banquet to busi¬ 
ness and professional colored peo¬ 
ple of this city will be held at the 
Wesley M. E. Church, corner 8th 
and San Julian Streets and not 
at Central Hall, as advertised. 
Take San Pedro Street car and get 
off at 8th Street and walk one 
block west to the church. 

Every person interested in the 
advancement of the Negro is cor¬ 
dially invited to be pre¬ 
sent, as their presence will lend 
encouragement to the gathering 
and its object. Five hundred tick¬ 
ets have been issued and ample 
provisions made to entertain 
every visitor. 

A BIG CROWD HEARS MR. 
TYRRELL SPEAK AT 
THE LYCEUM 


Many New Faces Present. 


The Lyceum was treated to 
another splendid address last Sun¬ 
day. The announcement that Mr. 
Tyrrell was to speak attracted 
many new faces, as Mr. Tyrrell 
is a forceful and entertaining 
speaker whose speeches in the 
recent municipal campaign did 
much to bring about that unpre¬ 
cedented victory. His address of 
an hour’s length was listened to 
with rapt attention. He con¬ 
gratulated the Lyceum for the 
services it was rendering to the 
community by keeping open house 
for the study and discussion of 
public questions. He spoke brief¬ 
ly of the confused political situa¬ 
tion and urged his hearers to 
study the public questions and to 
use their ballots to bring about 
needed reforms. That if a law 
give one class advantages denied an¬ 
other,the class discriminated against 
should use their ballots to have 
that law repealed. That the 
source of all power is in the people, 
each voter being a unit of the 
whole, with powers equal to that 
of any other unit. 

At the close of his speech, Mr. 
Tyrrell left to fill another engage¬ 
ment. Mr. Will Wheaton, who 

























THE LIBERATOR 


FITE 


returned recently from his visit 
to the National Republican and 
Democratic Conventions at Chica¬ 
go and Baltimore, made a short 
and interesting talk concerning the 
conventions named. At the Chi¬ 
cago convention, he saw the Taft 
Steam roller in operation, and also 
saw the Bryan steam roller at 
Baltimore. He said the Newland 
anti-Negro plank presented to the 
Democratic convention was dump¬ 
ed into the waste basket without 
consideration. He says that Gov. 
Wilson will receive the largest 

Negro vote ever polled for a 

Democratic presidential candidate. 

Short addresses were delivered 
by Rev. J. A. Stout, Messrs. Jas. 
M. Vena, Wallace Clark, Rev. 
E. F. Henderson, G. Walter 
Snell, Milton W. Lewis and J. 

Thos. Norris, the persident. Mr. 
Norris urged the colored voters 

to qualify and vote solidly for the 
colored candidates at the primar¬ 
ies. Mr. Vena stated that he, 
being under civil service, was not 
permitted to take any stock in 
the political discussion, no matter 
how much he desired to do so. 

Rev. J. A. Stout was accompan¬ 
ied by Mrs. Stout and a gentle¬ 
man and his wife from Arizona, 


whose names escaped our memory. 
Our Arizona friends were greatly 
pleased with the Lyceum. 


THOROUGHLY DISCREDITED 


In attempting to discredit every 
respectable public spirited man 
in the city, the bosses of the Fool’s 
Paradise have succeeded in making 
themselves the most thoroughly 
discredited bunch in the commun¬ 
ity. And that is not all; every 
person, so unfortunate as to be 
influenced by them, also becomes 
discredited. The fellow who 
thinks he is fooling everybody is 
deceiving only himself. 


DECENCY 

By a vote of 203 against 133, 
the German Reichstag has declared 
that marriages between Germans 
and native women in the colonies 
are legal. This is a triumph of 
sheer decency. It does not com¬ 
pel any German to marry a black 
or a brown woman. If Germans 
do not want a mixed mulatto 
progeny they may let the native 
woman alone. The law simply 
says that a marriage in fact is 
a marriage in law; that the virtue 
of a colored woman in the German 


colonies is to receive legal protec¬ 
tion. 

The simplest and barest demand 
of even half-civilized justice was 
not easily carried. It took the 
strength of Socialists and Catholics, 
fighting against the strongholds 
of German culture—the liberals 
and the aristocracy. Here were 
found the upholders of the dirtiest 
blot of modern white contact with 
backward races—the blot which 
makes the white Christian Church 
of the South to-day the strongest 
upholder of the system which de¬ 
nies all protection in law and cus¬ 
tom to the helpless black girl be* 
fore the lust of the white man.—
