VOL. III. LOS ANGELES, CAL., DECEMBER, 1901. No. 6. 



MAYOR M. P. SNYDER. 


At no tim© in the history of this city 
has it enjoyed such general prosperity 
in all of its departments than it hai. 
under the wise, broad, conservative ad¬ 
ministration of Mayor Snyder. The 
water question, which has been a po¬ 
litical issue for several campaigns,has 
been settled and settled in the interest 
of the city. The Water company, 
which has clutched like a vampire 
around the throats of the taxpayers, 
has been disposed of and the 
profits of the water supply that 
has flowed into the coffers of 
the few at the expense of the many, 
now flows into the city treasury for the 
benefit of all. Other important ques¬ 
tions affecting the city’s interest have 


been settled in the same manner to the 
interest of the taxpayers. There can 
be no better proof of the city’s pros¬ 
perity than the fact that during the 
fiscal year just ended building permits 
granted amounted to $2,700,000. The 
increase in bank deposits for the same 
time was $7,000,000. The popularity of 
the Mayor with all classes of citizens 
was fully demonstrated at the munici¬ 
pal election, when, although a staunch 
democrat, this republican city that 
gave President McKinley a plu¬ 
rality of 3000, gave Mayor Sny¬ 
der a plurality of 3200 just 
thirty days later, this, too, with all of 
the big daily papers against him. 

In politics he is a democrat; in 


official life he is a public-spirited citi¬ 
zen that the humblest may approach 
as one does a friend. Fully nine-tenths 
of the voters voted for him. When 
those who had charge of the movement 
to build an industrial school for col¬ 
ored youths laid the matter before the 
Mayor, believeing it the wish of the 
colored citizens with the dispos’tion to 
help them that he has always shown, 
He immediately sent a message to the 
City Council asking them to grant a 
site for the proposed school. He has 
since learned that the colored people 
do not favor it. There is a strong 
movement on foot to make him the 
next democratic candidate for gove- 
ernor. Should he be nominated there 
will be a mighty interesting campaign 
in this State next year. He is the 
people’s man. 


SHERIFF W. A. HAMMEL. 

In presenting Mr. Hammel to our 
readers we present to them a young 
man and worthy officer who can look 
the whole world in the face. He has 
served the people as sheriff three years 
t othe entire satisfaction of all classes 
and shades of political complexion. In 
appointing the deputies, while keeping 
the interests of the taxpayers upper¬ 
most, he allowed no c^ass of vote r s to 
be overlooked. He gave the colored 
voters in the person of Mr. J. B. Lov¬ 
ing their first deputy. Te appointment 
showed a determination to treat all 
alike and is highly appreciated bv the 
colored voters. The office fits Mr. Ham¬ 
mel and he fits the office, and he wants 
to fit it another term. 

-o- 

The governor and other officers of 
the State of Alabama are to be com¬ 
mended for the vigorous manner with 
which they are handling their mobs. 
If the good work is kept up Alabama 
will be soon regarded as a civilized 
community. The hardest problem the 
Southern people have to solve is how 
to make the whites obey the laws with¬ 
out killing them all off. 

- -o--- 

The progress in every department of 
the Wesley Chapel M. E. Church dur¬ 
ing the year has been remarkable. This 
is due to the fact that the church is 
blest with good officers, preacher and 
members. Each does his part well and 
all are working together for the good 
of the church and its membership.

MR. C. C. FLINT. 


Mr. Flint, the grocer, and president 
of the Colored Business Men’s League, 
is well known and needs no extended 
mention in this connection. He has 
been identified with every movement 
for the advancement of the colored cit¬ 
izens of this city for several years. 
He has always taken a prominent 
part in politics, but, like most of the 
thoughtful men of the race, he thinks 
the negro should pay less attention to 
politics and more to business, and is 
devoting his time to that purpose. 

Mr. Flint has a neat and well se¬ 
lected stock of groceries and is doing 
well. 


SUCCESS AND HOW IT MAY BE AT¬ 
TAINED. 

“Nothing succeeds like success.” 

Whatever our undertakings may be, 
we always wish to have them crowned 
with success. And too often we stop 
with the wishing. If you would be 
successful, stop so much wishing and 
go to work. If you want money do not 
sit and wait for the expected legacy of 
some wealthy relation, but work for 
it. God intended that we should work. 
“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou 
eat bread.”. 

Be not too fastidious as to the kind 
of work you do. Any avocation that 
is lawful and honest,honestly conducted 
will bring you to the goal of success. 
It matters not if you be a doctor, law¬ 
yer, cook or a bootblack, strive to be 
among the best of your profession. 
Whatever you do, do it well and what 
you know, know it well. We cannot 
know all things well, but the person 
that makes a success of his life’s work 
must know one thing well. The time 
is rapidly approaching when we will 


not be asked how much we know, but 
how wlll?As it is at the market,quality, 
not quantity will be required. The 
“jack of all trades,” and “master of 
none” is being gradually forced to the 
wall. 

We must have an aim in life, a fixed 
purpose and put forth a vigorous ef¬ 
fort to accomplish it. Profit by youi 
neighbor’s success. Be not satisfied 
with accomplishing just what he did, 
but do more. If we had been content 
with accomplishing just what our fore¬ 
fathers did, we would still he trying 
to cross the continent in a farm wagon 
instead of almost flying across it in a 
railway train. Read the biographies 
of our most successful men and women. 
You will find that they did not have 
the advantages that we have; but by 
hard and constant toil they reached 
the top-most round of the ladder rf 
fame. You will notice that the secret 
rf their success was the earnestness 
of application and constancy ; n the 
small things It. is the repeated blow 
of the woodman’s ax that causes the 
mighty oak to fall. To my memory 
comes the illustration of the clock 
which we all heard perhaps, hut. it will 
bear repeating: The clock strikes a* 
intervals; the ticking is momentary. 
We hear the one; we do not notice th^ 
other. Yet the hour stroke comes not 
if the ticking fails. So we see it is the 
small things that count in the long 
run. When we learn to do them well 
we are sure to accomnlish something 
worthy of commendation. 

Never be satisfied with yourself; 
that is, never think you know enough. 
There is always room for improvement 
always something to learn. Strive to 
make yourself everything th'at is noble, 
true and worthy. YoiUd you have the 
respect of your fellow men? Then be 
worthy of it. Better to be worthy erf 
it and not receive it than to receive 
it unworthily. 

Do not expect to reach the top of 
life’s ladder at one bound, but ascend 
it step by step. Never stop to look 
back, but let your motto be “odward 
and upward.” From on stage of 
civilization to another, and mark 
to another, from one altitude of 
glory to another, we still move on- 
wrad and upward. Thus did o.ur fore¬ 
fathers escape the barbarisms of past 
ages; thus ~ we conquer the errors of 
our time. I say with Rev. G. C. Rowe: 
“Go forth, my friend, upon your way, 
Each obstacle despising; 

Prove by your efforts every day, 

To all that we are rising!” 

Last, but not least, be such skillful 
artisans in rearing up the greatest of 
.Xfe’s Relyevemjents, character!, ttb'atf 
it too might be a grand and glorious 
success. And when our life’s work is 
ended, may it be truthfully said that 
the world was made better by our hav- - 
ing lived. 

LUCILLE A. BROWNE. 


REV. A. D. CHANDLER. 

We had the pleasure of meeting Rev. 
A. D. Chandler, who returned a short 
time ago from his eastern trip. He is 
locking well and was greatly benefited 
by the trip. He visited New York and 
several of our large eastern cities. Rev. 
Chandler is a scholarly young man, 
full of life and work and is a valued 
addition to the Christian workers of 
this city. 



MR. B. W. BROWN. 


Mr. Brown, manager of the Brown 
manufacturing Company ,whose place 
of business is 637 San Fernando street, 
is another evidence of the fact that the 
negro is beginning to take life serious 
and has settled down to business. The 
contention that, in order to enjoy the 
full benefits of American citizenship, 
the negro must become American in 
production as well as consumption, is 
now being accepted by him as a fact. 
In recognition of which fact the negro 
is now turning his attention to produc- 
iton—production in his own name and 
for his special benefit. Mr. Brown, 
the chemist and manufacturer of drug¬ 
gists’ specialties, is a living proof that 
we are grasping the situation and art? 
beginning to build on the ground floor. 
The virtues of Brown’s Crescent Celery 
Phosphate is becoming known and the 
demand for it increasing. Mr. Brown 
is producing something the people want 
and his value to his community will be 
enhanced as the demands for his pro¬ 
ductions increases. Mr. Brown is a 
director in the Colored Business Men’s 
League and his experience as a business 
man will make him a valuable mem¬ 
ber of the League.

MR. W. A. BROWN. 

On learning that the Mullen & Bluett 
Clothing Company had secured the ser¬ 
vices of Mr. W. A. Brown, who was 
then in the employ of the Pasadena and 
Pacific Electric Railway as conductor, 
in the March Liberator, among other 
things we said: “The Mullen & Bluett 
Company is fortunate in securing the 
services of so popular a young man. 
We extend our best wishes to Mr. 
Brown and the firm.’* 

A few days ago a representative of 
the Liberator called to learn how Mr. 
Brown had gotten along during the 
eight months he had been in the eru 
ploy of the firm. He was pleased to 
learn that the prediction of this journal 
had proved true, and was agreeably in¬ 
formed that Mr. Brown was not only 
a, favorite with the firm, but especially 
so with every employe of the house. 
One gentleman said in discussing the 
matter: “Mr. Brown’s aptitude in learn¬ 
ing the clothing business and the ease 
with which he has mastered its de¬ 
tails is simply remarkable. Another 
thing, everybody seems to know and 
like him. That in itself makes him a 
valuable salesman. We knew this 
would be the case from the s^art. As 
conductor Mr. Brown was tne most pop¬ 
ular man on the road running between 
this city and Pasadena. That was d-ue 
to his kind attention to all of the pa¬ 
trons of the road, especially the women 


and children. With no class is Mr. 
Brown more popular than the colored 
people. He is a born gentleman and 
his kindness and politeness is shared 
by all alike . While conductor he as¬ 
sisted all ladies on and off his car re¬ 
gardless of race or condition. This of 
itself made him popular with the col¬ 
ored people, as it was then and is now, 
too often the case that conduc¬ 
tors do not assist colored ladies 
on and off cars As colored peo¬ 
ple are prompt to return favor for favor 
their trade with Mullen & Bluett has 
greatly increased. Mr. Brown is a na¬ 
tive of Alabama,where he grew to man¬ 
hood. His father having been the 
owner of slaves, he knows the value 
of the negro as a friend and citizen 
and never fails to aid them when need, 
ed. Judge Allen said the Mullen & 
Bluett Company could turn their entire 
business over to Mr. Brown and go 
abroad and find everything safe on 
their return. He has the best wishes 
of all who know him.

Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish an able, patriotic letter from 
Judge Trask. All can read it with 
profit. His definition of anarchy is 
plain. His denunciation of mob vio¬ 
lence is in no uncertain terms. 


Dr. M. E. Sykes, whose success as a 
physician has been flattering, is doing 
as well in his real estate ventures. 


MR. JAMES M. VENA. 

Mr. Vena, secretary of the Colored 
Business Men’s League, and who re¬ 
cently received an appointment to a 
clerkship in the postoffice of this city, 
is a young man in whom his fellow citi¬ 
zens take pride. Mr. Vena is a reporter 
for the Sunday Herald, which position 
he has held for several years. He 
served as clerk in the county assessor’s 
office with satisfaction to all concerned 
and retires from the city engineer’s de¬ 
partment to accept his present position. 
In the organization of the Business 
Men’s League Mr. Vena took an active 
part and is very enthusiastic as to its 
ultimate success.

BIG THINGS TO BE SEEN AT THE 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 

Among the interesting things exhib¬ 
ited at the Chamber of Commerce^ is 
a family of eighteen big pumpkins 
weighing 3000 pounds, one beet, fifty 
pounds; one sweet potato, 16*4 
pounds. To give a description of other 
big vegetables which are on exhibition 
there by the ton would fill a volume. 
The large collection of Indian relics is 
interesting indeed and are mute re¬ 
minders of a brave people—nature’s 
stalwarts, who chose death rather than 
subjugation. There are also to be seen 
in great variety the products of the 
mines of Southern California, together 
with other exhibits representing every 
department of industry.

THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE is a 
statesmanlike document and is, in ev¬ 
ery way. characteristic of the man. It 
is a terse, clear, scholarly production. 
While it is conservative, he shirked no 
duty, but spoke of things with the air 
of a man who will do his sworn duty 
without fear or favor. There is a great 
man at the White House, a President 
of all the people.

When Czoigosc was electrocuted, Ben 
Tilman lost his bravest lieutenant; the 
others of his associates are so coward¬ 
ly they go in droves even when going 
to kill a “nigger.” It takes four or five 
hundred of them, heavily armed, to 
hang a “nigger” woman. 


The narration of the achievements 
of men is ever a source of inspiration 
to the writer, as well as the reader. To 
be uninterested in the success of those 
around us is to undergo starvation 
while standing in the thoroughfare of 
plenty. The man who doubles a for¬ 
tune left to him is hardly a second to 
the man who, beginning in his shirt 
sleeves, makes a fortune. Of the stars 


that light up the highway that leads to 
success, the self-made ones are favor¬ 
ites on account of their superior bril¬ 
liancy, and the affinity existing be¬ 
tween them and the ranks from which 
they rose. The latter is proof that 
along some line all well directed ef¬ 
fort will succeed, while the former of¬ 
fers success to a limited few. 

-o- 

MR. H. BOONE. 

Among the colored men of Southern 
California who have succeeded by hard 
blows, Mr. H. Boone, the blacksmith 
of Pasadena, occupies a prominent 
place. Thirteen years ago he spent a 
few days walking from one white 
blacksmith shop to another seeking 
employment, only to be turned away, 
although the owners of the shops were 
advertising for help. While looking 
for work he ran across a blacksmith 
outfit for sale, which he bought on 
time and bought out a lease on the 
property he now owns. Although he 
found it almost impossible to get em¬ 
ployment when seeking it of others, 
he got all of the work he could do 
as soon as he commenced employing 
himself. At the expiration of his lease 
he bought the property and built a 
shop to suit the requirements of his 
business. H ? s two-story six-room 
house corner Fair Oaks and Congress 
streets adds much to the attractiveness 
of that locality. Besides his pretty 
home fronting on Fair Oaks avenue 
and his cottage on Congress street, 
he owns an acre of land on Grand ave¬ 
nue. If turned into cash his property 
would readily bring $5000. Mr. Boone’s 
achievements are an example of what 
colored men can do here by industry 
and eceanomy. He says that while the 
color of his skin worked a hardship 
upon him when seeking employment 
in shops owned by white men it cut 
no figure whatever in getting work 
from white men when he set up for 
himself. On the contrary, they gave 
him as much work as he could do and 
the hardware people supplied him with 
material on time whenever requested. 
The opportunities for colored men to 
produce similar results are many and 
greater than they were thirteen years 
ago. All that is needed are men who are 
willing to start at the bottom, men who 
are willing to labor to raise their chil¬ 
dren above the position of scullions. 
While accumulating something for 
rainy day, by his moral and religious 
life he has gained the respect and con¬ 
fidence of his neighbors and his pres¬ 
ence added to the wellbeing of his 
community.

Mr. A. R. Wyche, who was badly 
bruised while breaking a Silkwood 
pony, recently purchased, is again at

MR. EUGENE WALKER 

Mr. Walker, the tailor and director in 
the Colored Business Men’s League, is 
one of the foremost young colored bus¬ 
iness men in the city. With a deter¬ 
mination to be his own boss and make 
a place for himself, he embarked in 
the tailoring business and by first-c’ass 
workjudicious advertising and prompt¬ 
ness, he soon found it necessary to 
employ help to meet the demands of 
his patrons. He now has a neat, well 
equipped establishment, employing 
four expert tailors, and among the 
hundreds of delivery wagons that 
crowd our streets, Eugene Walker’s 
can be seen. In connection with Wal¬ 
ker’ establishment a representative of 
the Liberator tells how Walker’s pro¬ 
gress surprised him. In the summer of 
1900 he called to have his measure 
taken for a suit and Mr. Walker and 
himself began to look over the large 
assortments for a suitable piece,Walker 
telling the price of each piece exam¬ 
ined, saying this is $25, $35, $40, e^c. 
The astonished newspaper man said: 
“Walker, where is your $12 goods?” 
Walker looked surprised and sa'd: “I 
am sorry, but we don’t make any suits 
for less than $25. You go up to Mullen 
& Bluett’s; they sell the best $12 suits 
in the city.” With the joke upon him¬ 
self the Liberator man obeyed orders. 
When we take into consideration the 
number of large up-to-date tailoring 
establishments there are in the city 
the sharpness of competition and 
the fact that Mr. Walker’s bus ; n c ss 
has steadily improved, .is sufficient 
proof of his ability as a business man. 
His success again demonstrates the 
fact that the negro who decides to do 
something for himself and stands by 
his decision will soon be able to do 
something for others.

JUDGE D. K. TRASK. 


LOS ANGELES, CAL., Dec. 12, 1901. 
Editor of the Liberator, 

Dear Sir: I have observed the work 
being done by the Liberator and othei 
papers for law and order, and I wish to 
commend this work. 

The right of an accused person to a 
fair and impartial trial before a fair 
and impartial jury should be ma’n- 
tainecl at any cost. The man who will¬ 
fully denies and defies the authority of 
laws enacted by organized society is 
an anarchist. The man who, without 
authority of law, undertakes to punish 
cr'me is a practical anarchist, for such 
a course finds its justification only in 
anarchy. Crimes are defined by stat¬ 
ute, and by the authority of statutes 
crimes are punished. The laws must 
he executed by the officers of the law, 
not by mobs. Human life can be taken 
lawfully only as authorized by law and 
by the proper officers of the law. In 
the eyes of the law, the lyncher is a 
murderer and an anarchist. He takes 
life without lawful authority, justifica¬ 
tion or excuse. He is an enemy to or¬ 
ganized society, because he denies its 
right to make laws that are binding 
upon him. He asserts the privilege of 
setting at defiance the most solemn 
constitutional and statutory guarantees 
of personal rights. His reckless, will¬ 


ful and wanton disregard of law stamps 
him as an enemy of the law and of 
organized society. It is said that the 
lyncher “takes the law .into his own 
hands.” But what law does he execute? 
Not the law of the land, for that law 
provides for a fair and impartial pro¬ 
cedure, which the lyncher disregards 
absolutely. The lyncher recognizes 
neither the statute law, nor the juris¬ 
diction of the officers of the law. He 
determines what are crimes, also the 
guilt, of the victims, and the character 
and mode of their punishment, without 
any references to the laws of the land. 
This is anarchy, pure and simple. The 
supremacy of our constitutions and 
laws should be maintained; and the 
lyncher should receive the penalty of 
the law which he violates and defies. 

Very respectfully yours, 

D. K. TRASK.

WHEN CHRIST WAS BORN. 
Sweet Bethlehem, a diadem 
Upon thy brow is set. 

A song of love came from above, 

We hear its music yet. 

A star rose bright that fateful night; 

It lit up earth’s dark way; 

A glory shone like rising sun, 

That leads to endless day. 

Glad tidings then of Peace to Men, 
From far-off Galilee; 

The world will sing, the bells will ring 
Undying melody. 

Rejoice, be glad, the angels said, 

The Lord to earth has come; 

Though He be slain He’ll come again, 

To call the wanderers home. 

In every clime a Christmas chime 
Will ring o’er hill and dale, 

And silver bells the anthem swells 
Its glory ne’er will fail. 

From shore to shore forevermor. 

Is heard that sweet refrain; 

Beyond the tomb in Eden’s bloom 
We’ll sing that song again.

Bloomington, Dec. 5th, 1901. 

DOCTOR STEPHEN BOWERS DOES 
NOT BELIEVE THE BIBLE STORY 
OF THE CREATION OF MAN. 

In his able paper, "The Recent Origin 
of Man” in "The Ram’s Horn” of the 
7th of this month, concerning the Ne¬ 
gro, the Doctor says: "It is my be¬ 
lief that the negro race began its ex¬ 
istence as an independent creation and 
possibly previous to the creation of 
Adam.” ', The the learned Doctor does 
not believe the Scriptural declaration 
that God created all men of one flesh. 
If that passage is not true, and the 
Negro is really an independent creation 
as the Doctor would have it. men will 
be left to choose from the bible what 
they will, and will not believe, what 
they will, and will not obey. The Doc¬ 
tor is on dangerous ground. But, if 
he should succeed in proving to the sat¬ 
isfaction of all that the Negro is an in¬ 
dependent creation ,and therefore was 
not a relative of the white man in the 
beginning, as the Bible claims, there is 
now no need of contention over this 
point; for since our residence in his 
country, our blood has been impreg¬ 
nated with Caucasian blood, and wheth¬ 
er we like it or not, the blood of our 
white fathers, and grand fathers, is 
coursing in our veins. You are on dan¬ 
gerous ground, doctor, much learning 
and delving in solitary rocks and dry 
bones in the capacity of state minerol- 
ogist, has weakened your faith in the 
inspired word- of Him who spoke chaos 
into fadeless beauty, swung into 
boundless space innumerable planets 
that whirl with incredible velocity 
around each other, each for the benefit 
of all; one grand harmonious congre¬ 
gation of whirling worlds.

THE LIBERATOR. 



DR. GEO. D. TAYLOR. 


MR. C. W. HOLDEN. 

Mr. Holden settled in this city June 
1888, and engaged in new and second¬ 
hand furniture business. In 1894 he 
sold out to advantage and engaged in 
farming three miles from the city. His 
farming venture proved a failure after 
two years of hard work. He next pur¬ 
chased a home and embarked into the 
hog and poultry business, which has 
proved 1 a success, and by close atten¬ 
tion to business he realizes from 
$1200 to $1500 net per annum. 
The value of his property is 
estimated at $4000. Mr. Holden says 
that while the hog and poultry busi¬ 
ness pays, no one can hope to succeed 
without hard work. By honest dealing 
and upright living Mr, Holden enjoys 
the confidence and respect of his 
neighbors. 

He is a trustee of the Wesley Chapel 
M. E. Church, master of St. John’s 
Lodge, A. F. and M., No. 16, worthy 
patron of Electa Chapter, No. 5, O. of 
E. S. Miss Lula B., his daughter, who 
is a student in the Los Angeles Art 
School, completed her first course with 
highest honors for the best exhibit in 
charcoal. Her water colors and other 
paintings bear the imprints of a genius. 
When she completes her studies here 
she expects to complete her studies 
in Paris, France. 


COLORED BEGGARS. 

There is quite a number of able- 
bodied colored beggars in this city. 
This is a new thing and accounts for 
the fact that the number of colored 
criminals has increased almost 50 per 
cent lately. These men are all-round 
toughs and should be driven out of the 
city. As a good citizen it is your duty 
if approached by one oi these fellows 
to report him to the police. If this 
is done the city will soon be rid of this 
undesirable class. There is plenty of 
work at good wages and there is ab¬ 
solutely no necessity for begging. Our 
character as law-abiding citizens has 
been excellent; to keep it so as far as 
possible is our duty. Representation 
in the jails and chain gangs is not the 
kind we need. 

The acquittal of Mr. Allen Watson 
of the charge of manslaughter for ac¬ 
cidentally killing little Norman Wil¬ 
liams. whom he rode down with h.is 
wheel, was expected. Watson’s good 
name had much to do with the verdict. 
His identity with the church and Sun¬ 
day School, where he is a regular earn¬ 
est worker,' helped him out of his un¬ 
fortunate trouble. Had he been a 
member of the clubs or dives the re¬ 
sult would have been different “A 
good name is rather to be chosen than 
riches.” 


Dr. Taylor, treasurer of the Colored 
Business Men’s League, is a graduate 
of the Leonard Medical College of 
Raleigh, N. C. His culture and broad 
liberal views on public questions has 
given him prominence and popularity 
in business and social circles. His 
skill as a physician has built up a lu¬ 
crative practice. As a practicing physi¬ 
cian he enjoys the confidence of an ap¬ 
preciative public. Since the destruc¬ 
tion of his office and fixtures by a fire 
a short time ago he has been domi¬ 
ciled with the genial Dr. J. S. Outtaw 
in the Wilson block, corner Spring and 
First streets. The doctor is a young 
man of recognized ability and holds a 
warm place in the esteem of his fellow 
citizens, and we bespeak for him a ca¬ 
reer worthy of his calling.

THE NEGRO OF TODAY. 

Up to the present time the negro ha* 
been a success in every avenue of life. 
As a soldier and citizen he has always 
been faithful and true to his coun¬ 
try’s flag; he has filled successfully 
many honorable positions. From that 
of a town constable to the register of 
the treasury of the United States; he 
has been a legislator, senator, judge, 
lawyer and police, and won honor, re¬ 
spect and confidence in every such po¬ 
sitions, and all this in twenty-five 
years. 

Every sort of hindrance has been 
thrown in his way, but he is overcom¬ 
ing them all, and daily winning 
friends from the ranks of those most 
opposed to his progress in life. 

Time is yet to bring better things 
for the negro race and let there be pa¬ 
tience and an honest endeavor to do 
the very best in everything, and be¬ 
fore long we shall reap what we have 
sown. STELLA HENDERSON.
