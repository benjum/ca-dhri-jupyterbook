THE LIBERATOR 



JUDGE FORBES DELIVERS A 
GREAT SPEECH AT THE 
LYCEUM. 


Greeted by a splendid audience 
of representative men and women. 

If there is one thing that the 
promoters of the Lyceum can feel 
justly proud of, it is the character 
of the men and women who attend 
its meetings. Its audiences, while 
on the average are not large in 
numbers, are immensely large 
in the things worth while. The 
Lyceum’s audiences are made up 
of men and women who think and 
who are striving to add to their 
stock of information—the things 
that will make them valuable citi¬ 
zens. It was this class of people 
that turned out last Sunday— 
thoughtful men and women voters, 
eager to get light upon the pressing 
issues now before the American 
people. They were not disappoint¬ 
ed, for Judge Forbes, a Christian 
gentleman of superb equipment, 
delivered one of the greatest 
speeches ever heard at the Lyceum. 

His subject: “Some Problems 
Needing Immediate Solution,” was 
ably discussed at great length. 
The inequality of our citizenship, 
the lax enforcement of the laws, 
and the extremely rich and poor, 
with the distance between them 
ever increasing, were each discussed 
in detail. He argued that in order 
to solve these problems, the for¬ 
mation of a new party is necessary, 
as the Republican and the Demo¬ 
crat parties are so commercial¬ 
ized that human rights and human 


advancement had been lost sight 
of. That the desire to make money 
is absorbing all the resources. of 
the country, while the more im¬ 
portant things of making men and 
women the greatest asset of the 
nation, is laft to drift at will and 
is drifting from bad to worse. 
Discussing the new party, which he 
said would have to come, will 
have to recognize and maintain 
the absolute freedom and equality 
of all its citizens before the law. 
That prejudice against races 
would iiave to be wiped out and 
absolute equality of opportunity 
for all, become a living reality. 
He said that the leaders of the 
new party will have to be states¬ 
men, big enough and far-seeing 
enough to fix the price of a day’s 
labor and the price of commodit¬ 
ies, so that hunger and poverty 
that now afflict thousands of the 
women and children of the country, 
would not be possible. He said 
that the government should own 
the land and give life laeses to 
its citizens, giving each family 
an allotment sufficient to produce 
the necessary sustenance. He 
said such views were socialistic, 
but that he was socialistic to that 
extent. Discussing the preval¬ 
ence of mob violence, with its 
burning at the stake outrages, he 
said: “The remembered some 

twenty years ago, when Henry 
Smith was burned to death with 
indescribable torture at Paris, Tex., 
how it filled the nation with horror. 
That the press and pulpit denoun¬ 
ced that outrage in the bitterest 
terms. That as one inhuman 
burning at the stake followed an¬ 
other, the denunciation by the 
press and pulpit gerw feebler and 
feebler until the human sesnibili- 
ties of the nation has become so 
blunted that the commission of 
these awful crimes attract no at¬ 
tention whatever. As a result, 
the desire to witness the com¬ 
mission of savage brutal crimes, 
has become nation-wide. He said 
that the cultured Greek nation 
and the powerful Roman Empire 
each reached that point in their 
career just before their dissolution 
and today he said: these two 


mighty nations exist as historical 
records—the once mighty Roman 
Empire being now a mere byword. 
And that nations following the 
same course would reach the same 
end as punishment, for sin is an 
inexorable law.” 

Discussing local conditions, he 
said the policy of denying repre¬ 
sentation to citizens on account of 
race or color, was not only narrow 
and short-sighted but is ultimately 
bound to defeat the ambition of 
its promoters. He said that this 
being a representative government, 
no office holder should receive the 
votes for reelection of the voters 
whom he had denied representa¬ 
tion. He said that fitness to 
fill public positions should be the 
only requirement of those desiring 
them. And that the office holder 
denying such opportunities to com¬ 
petent citizens on account of race 
or color had forfeited the support 
of such voters. 

It was a great speech and the 
colored men and women who failed 
to hear it, especially the young, 
lost a great opportunity. Judge 
Forbes is one of the few repre¬ 
sentatives left of the Republican 
party that wrote the most 
glorious pages of the Nation’s 
history—when it stood for the 
man, instead of the dollar; and 
placed in the firmaments of the 
federal constitution the Thirteenth, 
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend¬ 
ments. But that grand old party 
is dead.

The sad news of the death of 
Eugene Harris, formerly of Los 
Angeles, at Madison, Ill., has been 
received by Mrs. D. R. Jones, 
sister of the deceased. Eugene 
was born in Lawrence, Kansas in 
1875. He came West with his 
parents in 1888 and resided in this 
city until a few years ago, when he 
returned East. His genial dis¬ 
position caused him to be well 
liked and at the time of his death 
there were many friends in his 
new found home to regret his 
death. 


THE LYCEUM’S BANQUET 


The grand banquet to be tend¬ 
ered to the colored business and 
professional men and women, will 
take place at Central Hall, corner 
Washington St. and Central Ave., 
July 30th, Central Hall has been 
selected instead of the Masonic 
Temple because of its larger seating 


capacity. Tickets for the ban¬ 
quet are already on sale at 50 
cents per plate. In connection 
with the banquet will be a beauty 
contest. Each purchaser of a tick¬ 
et will be entitled to twenty-five 
votes, which he may cast for the 
lady if his choice. The lady re¬ 
ceiving the highest number of 
votes will be crowned queen. 
Among those who will appear on 
the program will be Mr. Stone¬ 
wall Jackson, of the Citrus High 
School, of Azusa, who has won 
fame as the fleetest runner in the 
country, Mr. Harold Prince of 
Pomona College, Mrs. G. M. Till¬ 
man, the well known poet and 
orator, and Mr. Frank Calmore. 
Other speakers who will take part 
on the complete program will ap¬ 
pear later. 

The announcement of the Ly¬ 
ceum’s banquet to the colored 
business and professional men met 
the general approval of the people 
who have long desired something 
of the kind to bring the people 
into business and social contact. 
Tickets will be placed in the hands 
of some young lady or gentleman 
of each church so that every person 
dasiring it may take advantage 
of the treat in store for those who 
attend the banquet.

THE LIBERTY DYE WORKS. 


The Liberty Dye Works have 
removed to their own plant— 
1447 E. 17th Street 
This is the first colored business 
firm to buy and build their own 
plant. Having purchased the lot 
and put up a cleaning and dyeing 
establishment with all modern e- 
quipment. The proprietors, Messrs 
O. S. Fletcher and J. W. Sims, are 
to be congratulated by the entire 
race. Their plant has the capa¬ 
city to employ a hundred persons. 
The Dye Works has certainly 
earned the patronage of the race. 
Should they receive the same patron 


age from the Negroes that they 
receive from the white people, 
they will furnish employment to 
a hundred people at once. 


A FIFTY DOLLAR SCHOLAR¬ 
SHIP TO BE GIVEN AS A RE¬ 
WARD FOR MERIT. 


In order to increase the interest 
of the young people in acquiring 
an education, Mrs. Harriet Wash¬ 
ington, one of the wealthiest col¬ 
ored women of this city, and a 
native of North Mississippi, will 
place with the Alumni Association 
of Southern California, a fifty 
dollar scholarship to be awarded 
to the student making the best 
average in scholarship and general 
deportment. This is the first gift 
of the kind by any colored lady 
of this city. 

Mrs. Washington is public spiri¬ 
ted and has heretofore given gen¬ 
erously to the Church, but has 
decided to use her surplus means 
in the future in the 
cause of education. This is in¬ 
deed very commendable and 
should be emulated by other 
wealthy colored men and women 
in this city, as it is only what we 
do to increase the usefulness and 
happiness of others that makes 
our own lives worth living. Free 
scholarships, however, should be 
awarded to Negro schools in the 
South, such as Fisk University, 
and Tuskogee. 

There are hudnreds of thous¬ 
ands of bright Negro boys and 
girls in the Southern States that 
have absolurely no opportunity 
to get even a common school edu¬ 
cation, where as every boy and 
girl in this state can get not only 
a grammar school, but a college 
education free. 

We trust to see the example 
set by Mrs. Washington followed 
by other members of the race, 
as it is high time that Negroes 
should take a personal interest 
in the educational advancement 
of the young men and women of 
the race. As money is valuable 
only as it is used to make men and 
women. The colored men and 
women of the North and West 


can and should maintain 50,000 
fifty-dollar scholarships annually 
for the purpose of educating strug¬ 
gling Negro boys and girls of the 
South. Such a course would 
revolutionize conditions, obtaining 
among our Southern black mil¬ 
lions. 

The Alumni Association should 
exercise great care in order that 
the scholarship be awarded 
only to the meritorious, as real 
merit among our people in this 
city is rarely ever noticed. 


A PRIVATE PICNIC. 

The Booker T. Wsahington Art

In the afternoon Mr. Troy an in¬

ly enjoyed by all. Other amuse 
ments of the day were boating

honored guest Mother Norris.

Dean of the Department of Arts 
and Sciences for twenty-four years,

within the past eight years and is 
without doubt destined to become 
one of the great Universities of 
the country. It has always been

first place with the institutions 
of learning for the white students.
