COLORED MARYLANDERS OPPOSE 
RENOMINATION OF TAFT. 



[GOVERNOR JOHNSON 
GOV. JOHNSON SAYS: 


I am not engaged in this cam¬ 
paign for any man or for any 
candidate or for the fruition of any 
man's ambition, I don't care who 
he is. I am here in a great cause. 

Two years ago we enlisted in 
that cause, here in California, and 
victory descended on us with the 
solemnity of a consecration. That 
cause means more to me than any 
regard I ever had for La Follette 
or any regard I now have for 
Theodore Roosevelt. And that 
cause has only one hope. 

The people are for Roosevelt. 
The politicians are for Taft. 

I believe the time has gone by 
when any man can be nominated 
for the presidency against the 
wishes of the people. 


COLORED MARYLANDERS 
OPPOSE RENOMINATION OF 
TAFT. 

The fololwing circular has been 


issued by the manly Colored Re¬ 
publicans of Baltimore, Md.: 

The Equitable Republican league 
standing as it does, for the true 
Republican constitution and against 
race prejudice and in defence of 
equal rights for all men, enters its 
protest against the renomination 
of President Taft. It hereby serves 
notice on all federal job holders 
and others who profess to deliver 
the votes of self-respecting Repub¬ 
lican voters of the state of Mary¬ 
land to the renomination of Presi¬ 
dent Taft, that they have no au¬ 
thority to speak for the intelli¬ 
gent colored voters of Maryland 
of whom there are thousands. 

This league opposes the renomi¬ 
nation of President Taft and will 
work for an unpledged delegation 
from Maryland to the Republican 
convention to be beld in Chicago 
in June for the following reasons; 

1. We think that the ‘pledged 
convention vote' is such a travesty 
on free and Republican govern¬ 
ment as to bring serious discredit 
upon a president of the United 
States who would countenance such 
barbarous methods in an effort 
to succeed himself. His adminis¬ 
tration should need no ‘ ‘steam 
roller" methods to induce the ap¬ 
proval of the American people. 

2. President Taft's adminis¬ 
tration of the high office of the chief 
executive has so thoroughly lacked 
the iniative, resourcefulness and 
positive backbone which should 
characterize the admisintration of 
so high an office as president of 
the United States that it would 
not only reflect upon the ability 
of the Republican party, but would 
unnecessarily try the patience of 
the American public to again place 


him in the race for this high posi¬ 
tion. 

3. At the very beginning of 
President Taft's administration, he 
vilely insulted every self-respecting 
colored American by stating in 
his inaugural address that he 
would respect bitter and unchris¬ 
tian race prejudice to the extent 
of refusing to appoint qualified 
colored men to office in communi¬ 
ties where such appointments 
would give offence, thereby feed¬ 
ing race prejudice with that upon 
which it thrives, encouragement, 
and that too from the chief magis¬ 
trate of this great nation. 

4. President Taft has accentu¬ 
ated this insult to the self-respect¬ 
ing colored Americans by surround¬ 
ing himself at Washington with a 
picked bunch of black flatteres 
whose interest in the welfare of 
the colored Americans whom they 
are supposed to represent is measur¬ 
ed by the amount of their pay 
checks and the “honor?" of their 
respective positions. Through 
these moral pigmies he not only 
finds a ready means of quieting 
the just complaints of the colored 
Americans, but seeks to facilitate 
his retention in his high office. 

WE WANT NO MORE OF 
TAFT.

UNFAIR METHODS OF THE 
SOUTH 


Speaking of the inequality of the 
ballot in the Southern states, as 
compared to it in the north, in his 




























TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


great speech here last Saturday 
night, Governor Johnson said; 

“In the south do you realize 
that one Republican vote in South 
Carolina or Mississippi equals fifty 
of your votes in the state of Calif¬ 
ornia? It is unjust and unfair, 
of course, but it is the only way that 
we can be beaten. But the time 
has gone by, my friends, when 
any man can be successful politi¬ 
cally in this great country of ours 
in defiance of the will of the people. 
(Applause.) 

The above conditions were 
brought about solely to injure the 
Negro. Now the white man is 
beginning to suffer. You cant 
permanently hurt the Negro with¬ 
out! ultimately injuring white men 

Look at our mobs, for instance. 

Continuing he said: 

“Today there is a quickening 
all along the line. Slow to move, 
are these people of ours; difficult 
indeed, to have them keep step 
to the onward drumbeat of demo¬ 
cracy; but once they move, woe 
betide the candidate or the man 
who endeavors to stem that onward 
march of democracy in the United 
States of America. (Applause.) 

Dishonesty not Essential to Success 

“We do not subscribe to the 
cynical belief that dishonesty and 
unfair dealings are essential to 
business success and are to be 
condoned when the success is mod¬ 
erate and applauded when the 
success is great. The methods by 
which the Standard Oil people 
and those engaged in the other 
combinations of which I have 
spoken above have achieved great 
fortunes can only be justified by 
the advocacy of a system of mor¬ 
ality which would also just avoid 
every form of crimnality on the 
part of a labor union and every 
form of violent corruption and 
fraud, from murder to bribery and 
ballot box stuffing in politics. We 
are trying to secure equality of 
opportunity for all; and the struggle 
for honesty is the same, whether 
it is made on behalf of one set of 
men or another. (Applause.) 


NEGROES WANT A DELEGATE 
TO THE REPUBLICAN NA¬ 
TIONAL CONVENTION. 


Los Angeles, Gal. 

Feb. 26, 1912. 

Editor The Liberator 

Dear Sir:— 

In view of the services rendered 
the Progressives by the 
colored voters, in freeing this state, 
city and county from machine 
rule; I think it but fair to give 
them a delegate to the National 
Republican Convention. Such 
a move would appeal to the colored 
voters throughout the country and 
bring them into the ranks of the 
men who stand for the rule of the 
people. Nothing could furnish 
a better object lesson, proving 
that the Progressives, are so, in 
fact as well as in name. If the 
Progressives control the next Na¬ 
tional Republican Convention, 
Governor Hiram W. Johnson will 
be nominated for vice-president 
and the election of a colored dele¬ 
gate by the Progressives of this 
state will be an inspiration to the 
wavering colored voters through¬ 
out the country. 

A colored man should be elected 
to the convention and as the sup¬ 
port given the Progressives by the 
colored men came almost wholly 
from Southern California the dele¬ 
gate should be chosen from this 
section. If we are to have a re¬ 
presentative as we should, I know 
of no one more worthy of such an 
honor than yourself. That you 
are the oldest Progressive in this 
section goes without saying. 
Opening the fight with your paper 
in J 896 against machine rule, you 
kept at it till the machine went 
down. 

As to race loyalty you have no 
superior. No member of the race 
has given longer and more unsel¬ 
fish service to it than you 
have. I think every intelligent 
thoughtful member of our race 
in this city will endorse the state¬ 
ment herein expressed. 

Yours for Progress, 

G. Walter Snell

ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


Rev. Kenchin spent Wednesday 
at Monrovia. 


Rev. Jas. A Stout, P. E. of the 
California District of the C. M. 
E. Church, sent in his subscrip¬ 
tion to The Liberator. Rev. Stout 
has been elected principal of the 
Texarkana Industrial school, re¬ 
cently founded. 

He says he wants The Liberator 
to continue its weekly visits when 
he reaches his new field of labor. 


The Venice Baptist Church 
raised $140 at the rally on the 
tenth. Rev. Lively, the new pastor 
is doing nicely. 


Before buying furniture visit the 
houses whose ads appear in this 
journal. They w^ant your trade 
and will supply your every need 
at prices and terms to suit. Men¬ 
tion The Liberator. 


$300 was raised at the Wesley 
Chapel rally last Sunday. The total 
will reach $500, as the storm kept 
many contributors away who are 
being heard from. With its pre¬ 
sent able pastor, Wesley is doing 
a great work and needs the assist¬ 
ance of all friends of the great cause 
in which it is engaged. 


The Rousseau musical family 
filled engagements at leading Pasa¬ 
dena hotels this week. 


The funeral services of Editor 
Neimore were attended by a large 
crow T d. The floral offerings were 
many and beautiful. A. J. Roberts 
and Sons, undertakers, had charge. 


THE A. M. E. ZION NOTES 


Regular morning and evening 
services as usual. One of the 
12 year old boys of the church is 
planning to give an Easter enter¬ 
tainment for his Sunday school 
class. Look for program next 
week. 

















THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


Rev. W. J. J. Byers will preach 
at Phillips Chapel, Santa Monica 
next Sunday afternooon, March 
17th. Santa Monica friends will 
give him a good audience. 


Where did that style of beating 
time at a funeral come from? 

I guess it came from Washing¬ 
ton. 


Sunday, morning at Mount Zion 
Baptist Church, Dr. Hill will dis¬ 
cuss “The Trinity”. Those who 
are confused on this important 
subject will do well to hear this 
sermon. Dr. Hill's sermons are 
always able and the services at 
his church entertaining. 


Christophe will be staged at 
Lenox Casino, New York City. 
Prof. Easton, the author, deserves 
congratulations. 


ENTERTAINMENT FOR BENE¬ 
FIT OF BAND 


The Citizen's Band will give an 
. entertainment soon to raise money 
for new uniforms. At the meeting, 
last Sunday, the following officers 
were elected:—L. G. Eggleston, 
director; J. W. Anderson, assistant 
director; S. C. Miller, president; 
Wm. H. Shackleford, secretary; 
W. F. Woodyard, treasurer; Sid 
Carter r vice-president; W. L. 
Fields, manager; W. H. Nettles, 
assistant manager; A. Woodyard, 
corresponding secretary. 

Other members are J. Hawkins, 
H. Southard and W. Daniels. 


The Young Men's Progressive 
Afro-American League was organ¬ 
ized on the 11th in the office of 
Mr. L. A.. Watson at 1705 East 
9th street; its aim is to promote the 
colored peoples interest along eco¬ 
nomic and political lines. Among 
its active members are Attorney 
Darden and Dr. Cummings; its 
next meeting will be held Monday 
evening the 18th. The public is 
invited. Refreshments will be 
served free.

THANKS 

We acknowledge with sincere 
gratitude the receipt of a neat 
volumn entitled “Favorite Quota¬ 
tions/' from our beloved former 
pastor, Rev. G. R. Bryant, pastor 
of Jackson street, M. E. Church, 
Louisville, Ky. These quotations 
were compiled by Rev. Bryant 
and are selections from the master¬ 
pieces of the world's great writers and 
speakers. It is a volumn of in¬ 
estimable value to students and 
public speakers. 

Many thanks Reverend for this 
precious volumn and the beauti¬ 
ful calendar sent some months ago. 


Rev. J, H. Taylor who has been 
suffering with ill health since his 
return from New Mexico a month 
ago, will soon be able to again take 
charge of the Christian Mission 
at La Grange and Santa Fe Ave.

WHY are the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD FAMOUS Jubilee Singers 
called “World Famous” and con¬ 
ceded by all good authorities the 
prime favorites of two Continents? 

WHY are the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD-FAMOUS Jubilee Singers 
selected from the best homes, from 
Colleges, and from Leaders of great 
Church Choirs? 

WHY are the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD-FAMOUS Jubilee Singers 
composed of eight individual solo¬ 
ists, each one of whom is a thor¬ 
ough musician? 

WHY are the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD-FAMOUS Jubliee Singers 
so enthusiastically endorsed by 
high officials of Church and State 
and by Music Critics? 

WHY for the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD-FAMOUS Jubilee Singers 
are the receipts two or three times 
greater than local people in their 
home city think they will be? N 

WHY are the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD FAMOUS Jubilee Singers 
the one company which always 
pleases everybody, whetherjmusi- 


cally inclined or not, and never 
displeases anybody, however musi¬ 
cal he may be; ? 

WHY have the WILLIAMS’ 
WORLD-FAMOUS Jubilee Singers 
been returned in some cities for 
eight consecutive seasons and are 
still more popular in those same 
cities? 

The answer to each of the above 
questions in summary is about this: 
The WILLIAMS’ WORLD-FA¬ 
MOUS Jubilee Singers have had 
more extensive Literary and Musi¬ 
cal Training, have been together 
longer, traveled more, made more 
return dates, are more in demand, 
better in appearance, better known, 
worth more, have finer advertising, 
command higher prices, make more 
money and in every and all ways 
conceded superior to any other 
similar combination of the present 
time, in this country or in any 
country.)

Mr. J. J. Neimore, editor of 
the “Eagle” who died in this city 
Saturday, was one of the pioneer 
newspaper men in Southern Calif¬ 
ornia. Although his education was 
limited, he possessed a will power 
and physical energy, that seemed 
inexhaustible. He was a tireless 
worker in the cause of the race and 
had unbounded confidence in its 
ultimate success. 

He was a great dreamer and 
originated many brilliant schemes 
for the creation of enterprises that 
would furnish employment for 
members of the race, which fell 
through for want of proper sup¬ 
port. 

He was hopeful, ambitious, cour¬ 
ageous, public-spirited and restless. 

Mr. Neimore was well liked, 
had many friends, but unfortunately 
many of his friends who wept 
around his bier, withheld from him 
their support in the hours of his 
fiercest struggles. 

Without the aid of Mrs. Neimore 
who went into his newspaper 
work with self-sacrificing devotion 
as only a wife can do, he could 
not have stood beneath the load, 
as he did twenty years. 

If people would scatter more 
flowers in the paths of the living 
and less on the graves of the dead, 
how many dead would still live!

THE WILLIAMS’ JUBILEE 

The William’s Jubilee Singers 
who will sing at the Shrine Audi¬ 
torium on the 26th will have a 
crowded house. As they will sing- 
one night only, tickets are selling 
rapidly. It is an opportunity that 
no one who has heard them, wants 
to miss. It was to assist the Y. 
M. C. A. that they consented to 
visit this city.. 

The cause is a good one. Let 
everybody turn out. 


WILL SPEAK AT THE LYCEUM 

Mrs. Chas F. Edson will address 
the Lyceum next Sunday, 4 p. 
m., March 17th. Ladies are es¬ 
pecially invited as her address will 
deal with the home and health 
of children—two matters of vital 
interest to all mothers and home¬ 
makers. 

Mrs. Edson, who is the ablest 
and most popular woman orator 
in the state, is well known to the 
Lyceum’s audiences and a large 
turn out is expected. 

Mrs. Edson contributed more 
toward securing the ballot for the 
women of this state than perhaps 
any other female orator, taking part 
in that great achievement. With 
a group of able assistants she left 
the cities and towns and went into 
the “hedges and highways” and 
talked with the farmers at their 
plows, to the miners in their camps 
and to oil-well drillers in the midst 
of their derricks. It was the votes 
of those noble, sturdy yeomen that 
set the women of California free. 

Let all of the women come out 
and bring their boys and girls. 

Good music and singing. Every¬ 
body invited, 1209 1-2 Central

Mr. L. A. Handley, city clerk,

brother of Mr. J. C. Williams of 
this city, died on the 8th. • He 
was a wealthy, popular farmer own¬

Mr. Williams having been in ill 
health for some years, his ranch 
has been successfully conducted
