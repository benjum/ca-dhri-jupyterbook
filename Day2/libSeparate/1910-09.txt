NATIONAL CONVENTION 
OF THE INDEPENDENT 
POLITICAL LEAGUE 

The following resolutions were 
adopted in the convention. 

"The National Independent Po¬ 
litical League is an organization of 
colored people who believe the sal¬ 
vation of their race and the Nation 
depends upon an intelligent use of 
the ballot. 

We call attention to the fact that 
today no civilized country on earth 
can parallel, the United States in 
the wholesale murder of innocent 
men, in the persecution of the 
weak, in religious discrimination 
and proscription and in the help¬ 
lessness and inefficiency of the ju¬ 
diciary. 

"Texas has outrun Kishineff. 
color prejudice is worse than 
caste; Jim Crow cars are indefen¬ 
sible and recent decisions of the 
supreme court are repugnant to 
the fundamental principles of jus¬ 
tice and democracy. 

"What shall we do? Vote, Vote 
right and independently. We Ne¬ 
gro Americans have at least a half 
million votes. Hitherto we have 
given these votes blindly to one 
party and received in return a few 
paltry offices. That party has re¬ 
peatedly broken its pledges to 11 s, 
while Theodore Roosevelt has 
given us Brownsville and William 
Taft in a week surrender to preju¬ 
dice has dismissed worthy officials 
simply for being black. 

"Our uncritical and unquestion¬ 
ing support of one party has 
proven disastrous. Like the mass 
of laborers of the land we have 
sold high privilege too cheaply. In 
return for support at the polls Col¬ 
ored Americans must hereafter de¬ 
mand protection, education, equal¬ 
ity of opportunity and justice. 


THE LIBERATOR 

“The present two leading par¬ 
ties have denied us these things. 
The southern Democrats have dis¬ 
franchised thousands of our vo¬ 
ters and the Republicans have let 
them do it with faint and fainter 
protest. 

"Il is time therefore for an inde¬ 
pendent movement i npolitics. We 
should refuse alliance with either 
of the two dominant parties at 
present, and confine our attention 
to men ; we should vote only for 
congressmen and other candidates 
for office who pledge themselves 
to advocate the following meas¬ 
ures : 

‘T. The enforcement of the 
Constitution, to stop disfranchise¬ 
ment and peonage. 

“ 2 . The passage of .a national 
anti-Jim Crow car law-. 

"3. National aid to education 
with the same opportunities to all 
children. 

"4. National legislation against 
lynching and mob law. 

“5. The restoration of the dis¬ 
charged Brownsville soldiers. 

“To candidates of any party who 
pledge themselves to these meas¬ 
ures we pledge our own votes and 
the voters of all black men whom 
we can persuade to stand on their 
manhood and vote like free men. 

The convention began on Au¬ 
gust 4th and ended August 6th. 
Among the delegates were: Bish¬ 
op Alexander Walters of the Af¬ 
rican Methodist Episcopal Zion 
church of New York, president; 
Prof. W. E. B. Du Bois of At¬ 
lanta, Ga.; Bishop H. M. Turner 
of the African Methodist Episco¬ 
pal Bethel church of Atlanta, Ga.;

tist, of Washington, D, C.; J. L. 
Johnson of Columbus, Ohio; 
Francis H. uarren of Detroit, 
Mich., editor of the Informer; N. 
B. Marshall, counsel for the 


Brownsville soldiers ; Rev. S. L. 
Corrothers of Washington, and 
Judge M. W. Gibbs of Little Rock.

EDITOR A. IVISON 

WILLIAMS DEAD 

The untimely death of Lieut. A* 
Ivison Williams, the brilliant edi¬ 
tor of the California Cactus, re¬ 
moves from the scenes of human, 
activities a young man of sterling 
worth. As a member of the Ninth 
Ohio Colored Battalion, under 
Major Young, lie saw service in 
the Cuban campaign during the 
Spanish-American war ; being pro¬ 
moted to lieutenant for meritori¬ 
ous service. 

After retiring from the army he 
returned to his native state and 
took a prominent part in politics 
as a supporter of the Hon. Tom 
L. Johnson of Cleveland. In rec¬ 
ognition of his services, Mayor 
Johnson appointed him to an im¬ 
portant clerkship which he filled 
with credit to himseif and the ad¬ 
ministration, until forced by ill 
health to resign. It was the hope 
that the balmy climaie of South¬ 
ern California would stop the rav¬ 
ages of tuberculosis -jiat brought 
him here. In his unequal battle 
with the grim reaper, he displayed 
dhe same heroism and courage that 
won him promotion on the battle 
fields and in the yellow fever 
camps in Cuba. His career was 
short hut brilliant; his years few 
but full of honors. 

Peace to his ashes.

President Taft’s Negro 
Policy will Endanger 
Republican Success 
in Indiana and Ohio. 

THE REMOVAL OF RUCKER 

Within ten days after the ap¬ 
pointment of Hon. Whitefield Mc- 
Kinlay to the Colleclorship of the 
port of Georgetown,, D. C., Inter¬ 
nal Collector of Revenue Henry 
A. Rucker, of Atlanta, Ga., is re¬ 
moved from office. 

The colored voters of the coun¬ 
try were greatly encouraged as 
a result of the McKinlay appoint¬ 
ment. The removal of Rucker im¬ 
mediately following, however, is 
disconcerting, and discouraging to 
the Negro voters of the country. 
The removal of Rucker seems to 
be in keeping with Postmaster 
General Hitchcock’s policy, en¬ 
dorsed by President Taft, to re¬ 
move every Negro holding an im¬ 
portant office in the South and 
thus break the power of the Negro 
in National Conventions. 

Cecil Lyon, in Texas, has been 
permitted under this scheme to 
have unlimited sway in the re¬ 
moval of Negroes from office in 
Texas. Cecil Lyon, the National 
Committeeman from Texas, sup¬ 
ported by Mr. Hitchcock, has re¬ 
moved every Negro in Texas, so 
that none hold positions of import¬ 
ance. It is up to the Negro voters 
of Ohio to decide by the way they 
cast their votes in the coming fall 
election whether they will stand 
by such conduct on the part of the 
administration, or not. Perhaps 
Cecil Lyon can furnish more elec¬ 
toral votes and put more Republi¬ 
cans in Congress from Texas than 
the Negroes of Indiana and Ohio. 


We shall see. There are over three 
hundred thousand Negro voters in 
the Northern States whose votes 
are counted as they are cast. 

Republican candidates for Con¬ 
gress during the fall election must 
not deceive themselves. The old 
game of putting out a little money 
here and there in the hands of Ne¬ 
gro preachers and a few Negro lo¬ 
cal leaders to bring the colored vo¬ 
ters into line has passed. A few 
speeches here and there making 
glittering promises to the Negro 
voters in the fall will not answer. 
It is our belief that the present 
policy of Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. 
Taft toward the Negro in the 
South has got to be changed, or 
the Negroes in the fall elections 
will find some other candidates 
rather than the Republican Con¬ 
gressmen to vote for. The time 
for plain speaking has come. 

We reiterate that which we have 
said before. The Age is a Republi¬ 
can paper. It wants to support the 
Republican administration, includ¬ 
ing candidates for Congress, and 
will do so if the way is made possi¬ 
ble, by proper treatment of the Ne- 
gropeople. The removal of the 
President’s “color line” would help 
the situation all along the line.— 
N. Y. Age. 


FIRING ACROSS THE COLOR 
LINE 

Down in Mississippi a few years 
ago a white foot peddler called at 
the home of a prosperous colored 
farmer and requested a night’s 
lodging. His request was grant¬ 
ed with an invitation to go into 
the sitting room ancl rest himself. 
While supper was being prepared 
he entertained himself by reading 
books and papers with which the 
room was well supplied. At the 


ringing of the supper bell, the fam¬ 
ily, clean and well clad, took their 
places at the table. After the bless¬ 
ing had been asked, the peddler 
with a look of confusion, said: 
“I didn’t know that white and 
negro men ate at the same table?” 
“They don’t, unless both are gen¬ 
tlemen,” replied the colored land¬ 
lord. 


Heard in a Pullman car going 
through to Arizona. 

Passenger’s wife to husband— 
Dear, tell the porter if he has only 
one set of brushes not to polish my 
tan shoes. 

Husband—“Porter, if you have 
but one set of brushes you had bet¬ 
ter not touch my wife’s shoes; for 
I am a white man from Texas and 
you know what we do to a nigger 
down there.” 

Porter’s reply— f ‘A white man 
from Texas is no more to me than 
a white man from Massachusetts 
or California, but a brute from 
Texas is a different thing.” 


Miss Allie H. Barnett of Stew¬ 
art, Nevada, nurse in the Canon 
Training School for Indians, 
spoke to a large audience at the 
Forum on the 4th inst. Her dis¬ 
course on tuberculosis; how con¬ 
tracted, how contagion, may be 
prevented and how to handle un¬ 
fortunate patients suffering with 
this dread disease, was listened to 
with rapt attention. Her talk on 
domestic science was very help¬ 
ful. What she had to say about 
bread-making and dress-making 
ought to have been heard by 
every girl of the race. 

Miss Barnett is a cultured 
young woman of splendid phy¬ 
sique adorned by those womanly 
graces that always accompany a 
well cultured mind. With her 
sister Miss Barnett has spent her 
summer vacation touring our 
great state of California. Come 
again, your visits are indeed prof¬ 
itable to us all.

BULLY, BULLY. 

The victor} 7 ” for good govern¬ 
ment achieved by the Lincoln- 
Roosevelt Republican. League at 
the August primaries was splendid. 
It was “bully,” as Col. Roosevelt 
would say. The machine was ut¬ 
terly crushed with every cog in 
its running gear smashed. The 
great state of California is free. 
Hon. Hiram Johnson, the mag¬ 
netic leader in thiu state, has not 
only freed it, but has given an 
immense impetus to the struggle 
for freedom going on all over this 
country. Hiram Johnson leads 
California and California leads the 
nation. We are proud, doubly 
proud of California’s redemption. 
To make California’s redemption 
permanent, certain legislation is 
needed. The party circle and 
column should be removed from 


the official ballot. The judiciary 
should be taken out of politics, 
and the merit system adopted for 
state and county offices. 


THE NEGRO AND THE IN¬ 
SURGENTS. 

The success of the so-called in¬ 
surgents’ movement means as 
much for the negro as it does for 
the whites—nay—more. The ne¬ 
gro should join the reform forces 
and assist in the restoration of the 
government to the people. Por 
the negro to aid in securing the 
reforms for which Roosevelt, 
Johnson, Senators La Follette, 
Dolliver and Curtis stand, he will 
earn and secure the sympathy and 
aid of these great leaders in his 
fight against disfranchisement, jim 
crowism, peonage and discrimina¬ 
tion ©n account of the race. The 
negroes are American citizens and 
a wrong inflicted upon them will 
ultimately react upon other citi¬ 
zens. As an American citizen, 
the negro, if he would secure the 
full enjoyment of his rights, he 
will have to be in sympathy with 
the white Americans who stand 
for highest ideals of free govern¬ 
ment. There is no other way. 


WOULDN’T ENDORSE TAFT 

The refusal of the Republican 
State Convention to endorse Pres¬ 
ident Taft’s administration in ses¬ 
sion at San Francisco, was con¬ 
sistent to say the leasf. Think of 
an insurgent convention endorsing 
the Taft administration. What 
body of men with the interest of 
the people at heart can endorse 
President Taft’s policy? The 
president while serving the “in¬ 
terests” at the expense of the 
white citizen, he has recognized 
and drawn the color line in the 


public service to the lasting hurt 
of the negro people. As a result 
jim crowism, disfranchisement, 
race hate and color discrimina¬ 
tion is everywhere on the increase. 
Mob violence and lawless acts per¬ 
petrated upon innocent negroes 
are of almost daily occurrence. 

The President’s negro policy is 
un-Christian and un-Democratic. 
It is a violation of the sacred 
rights of man, and an insult to 
every manly American. The in¬ 
surgents are right, the President 
has accomplished nothing worthy 
of endorsement. 


The annual conference of the 
A. M. E. church will convene at 
Sacramento on the 5th. The uni¬ 
versal prayer is, that Bishop 
Grant send a big man to Los An¬ 
geles. What the Methodist 
churches here need is two or three 
big preachers whose interest ex¬ 
tends to something more than 
their salaries. May the good Lord 
help us. 


HARTWELL AGAIN 

Owing to blunders and over- 
confidence, Coroner Hartwell is 
still on the hands of the voters, 
with the solid support of the S. P. 
machine and its subsidized press, 
including two Negro weeklies and 
one little Negro preacher, a single 
shot from the Liberator threw 
his election in doubt for a week. 
Had the advantages gained been 
followed up, his defeat would 
have been so decisive that, a few 
hours’ counting would have fixed 
his fate. To bring about the de¬ 
feat of a recreant office holder is 
one of the highest duties involved 
upon the press. We will deal with 
Mr. Hartwell later on.

A FEDERAL LAW 

AGAINST LYNCHING 

If mob murders are to be broken 
up and this country saved from 
the disgrace of every day cold¬ 
blooded murder of its citizens of 
color, there wlil have to be a na¬ 
tional law against lynching. The 
National Constitution guarantees 
to every citizen the right of trial 
by a jury of his peers when 
charged with crime. It is the 
duty of the Federal government 
to enforce its guarantees. A gov¬ 
ernment that will not or cannot 
protect the lives and property of 
its citizens at home has absolute¬ 
ly no right to existence. If a 
state cannot or will not protect 
the lives of its citizens from law¬ 
lessness, the federal statutes gives 
the national executive authority 
to step in. President Cleveland 
put down a Chicago mob, to pro¬ 
tect property in spite ot the pro¬ 
test of the governor of Illinois. 
His authority to use the federal 
troops on the occasion named has 
never been questioned. What is 
really needed now, is to put mob 
murderers in the category with 
counterfeiting and mail robbing. 
Give us a national law against 
lynching; have counties in which 
lynch in gs occur indemnify rela¬ 
tives of persons lynched. Make 
twenty-five years in the federal 
penitentiary and five thousand dol¬ 
lars fine, the penalty of every' per¬ 
son convicted of, 'or in any way 
taking part in a lynching. With a 
law enacted and enforced covering 
the above mentioned ground, there 
w Oil Id soon be a wholesome re¬ 
spect for law in every section of 
the country. Human life would 
become more sacred and our coun¬ 
try raised in the estimation of God 
and civilized men. If this govern¬ 


ment hopes to exist as a civilized 
power, it will have to furnish its 
non-progressive white cut-throats 
higher amusement than that of 
roaming at large killing negroes. 
For the crime of lynching ne¬ 
groes by white men will only lead 
to lynching of white men by white 
men. 

MR. J. W. COLEMAN 

The man who has done, and is 
doing more real good for his race 
than any one man in the state of 
California. His good judgment 
and careful selection has enabled 
him to successfully place over 
eight thousand five hundred (col¬ 
ored) men and women in good po¬ 
sitions throughout the state and 
elsewhere. He has by supplying 
the best class of help, raised the 
standard of wages for his people, 
until now he commands the pa¬ 
tronage and influence of those who 
know the value of good service. 
Consequently, those who want col¬ 
ored help, naturally will place 
their orders with him. So you will 
save time, worry, expense and dis¬ 
appointment by calling at his of¬ 
fice. Remember he solicits the 
patronage of reliable help only.

Attorney Rufus S. Stout of the 
law firm of Colinan & Stout is a 
valuable addition to the legal pro¬ 
fession of the city. He is a broad- 
gauged man, of splendid mental 
attainment. He was admitted to 
the bar at Houston, Texas, in 
1894; was admitted to practice 
in the United States court in 
1896, and admitted to the supreme 
court, January, 1899. 

The formation of the law firm 
of Colman & Stout is an innova¬ 


tion in the colored legal circles 
of the city and means much for 
the race as well as for the pro¬ 
fession. It is the entering wedge 
to a combination of the colored 
legal capital of which Los Ange¬ 
les is so well supplied. The firm 
enjoys a good practice, which is 
not confined to any one race. Their 
practice is of the high class o'rder. 

Besides his law practice, At¬

the C. M. E. church of the El Paso 
District, and the author of Stout's 
Business Guide, a book, the sale 
of which has run into thousands.

The way that Col. Roosevelt is 
throwing it into Taft is a caution. 
From every view-point the Taft 
administration is a miserable fail¬ 
ure. Feeling himself somewhat 
responsible for Taft, Cannon ism 
and Aldridgism, the colonel has 
taken charge of the insurgent 
forces as a sort of relief to his con¬ 
science.
