628 North Eutaw Street 

Baltimore, June 13-1912. 

To the Editor of The Liberator , 

Los Angeles, Cal. 

Dear Sir: 

I note in your issue of the 7th 
Inst, an article by one “Hon. 
James Alexander, president of the 
Afro-American Council, of your 
City, I presume. Your article says 
he is the leading Afro-American 
in California, etc. Now if this is 
true, I am sorry for a state that 
cannot produce any better article 
than this “leading man” 

I have not the honor of his 
acquaintance, nor do I especially 
desire it, if for no other reason 
than to state that what he says 
in reference to the General Con¬ 
ference, recently held in Kansas 
City, Mo. It may be true that he 
purchased a badge, but it did 
not require any badge at all to 
get in the Conference, any part of 
it, at any time. Thousands of 
persons attended the sessions of 
the Conference, many of them on 
the first floor, and mixing with 
the delegates. 

There is not a word of truth of 
the gavel breaking and police call 
and a “dash for the Bishop” busi¬ 
ness. Dr. Peck, an old friend of 
mine, never had the slightest chance 
to be elected one of the Bishops at 
any time during the session of 
the Conference. 

You may publish this if you 
choose and I will stand sponsor 
for it. You may refer the matter 
to Dr. Peck, and he will I am sure 
substantiate what I yave said. 

Very truly yours, 

J. H. Murphy. 


On the 18th of last April, Mayor 
Wm. Thum, of Pasadena, delivered 
a lecture to the Brotherhood of 
the African Methodist Church of 
that city in which he urged the 
Negroes to curb their ambition or 
words to that effect; that a litlte 
race prejudice is a good thing; 
and that they must live by them¬ 
selves and not be too eager for 
things that white men want; “be 
modest;” that the race in the 
minority must destroy race preju¬ 
dice by modesty—by showing it¬ 
self superior to the majority— 
in short, all laws for securing 
justice and equal opportunity must 
be maintained and enforced by 
the minority. 

The Mayor may be all right 
at heart and is, doubtless, sincere, 
but his theory is a reversal of 
civilized procedure. A majority 
that does not furnish full protection 
to the minority in the enjoyment 
of common rights cannot long 
maintain stable government. 


Doesn’t Practice What He Preaches 


Until'Pasadena went wet, Mr. 
Benj. Holmes, a colored restaurant 
keeper of that City, had a restau¬ 
rant beer license; this enabled 
colored beer drinkers to drink by 
themselves. When the town went 
wet, authorizing the police commis- 
ioner to [ grant retail liquor license to 
hotels and restaurants, the Mayor 
and police commissioner revoked 
Holmes’ license on the lone testimony 
of a Pasadena habitual jail-bird. 
This Negro swore to a complaint 


against Homes as a matter of 
revenge because Holmes refused 
to sell him beer. 

Before revoking Holmes’s li¬ 
cense, to be fair the Mayor and 
Police Com. ought to, at least, 
have required the testimony of 
reputable witnesses, which it 
would have required had Holmes 
been white instead of black. If 
Mayor Thum thinks that Negroes 
should live together, eat and drink 
together, he should see to it that 
the Negro restaurant keepers enjoy 
the same rights enjoyed by others 
engaged in that business, providing, 
that they obey the ordinances 
governing his business. And before 
revoking a Negro business man’s 
license for supposed infractions of 
the law, the same evidence should 
be required as would be if he was 
white. In the Holmes matter this 
seems not to have been the case. 

Now, if a Negro wants a drink, 
he must go to a white restaurant— 
just what the Mayor advised 
against—and, perhaps, to be re¬ 
fused. 

While we have nothing to say 
in favor of the saloon business,, 
we believe in a square deal in every 
commercial pursuit recognized by 
law. We have no patience with 
race prejudice, it helps no one.. 
We believe that the man who 
behaves himself, should live, eat 
and drink where he pleases, pro¬ 
vided, he can pay for it. 

When Mayor Thum was candi¬ 
date for the office he now holds,. 
The Liberator supported him, be¬ 
cause his record as a citizen and 
business man was equal to any in 
his city, and the colored voters,,

will continue to live above the 
influence of race prejudice. 


letters from the people 


Los Angeles, Cal. 

June 16, ’12. 

Editor The Liberator 

Dear Sir:—Allow me to con¬ 
gratulate you on your manly stand 
for fair play as set forth in The 
Liberator of the 14th inst. You 
have struck the key-note and the 
question asked on every hand is, 
What are the colored men and 
women voters going to do about 
it? The colored voters are alone 
to blame for the present color 
discriminations in the public ser¬ 
vice. Politicians will conceed to 
the voters only what they are 
forced to conceed. The colored 
voters by virtue of their voting 
strength are entitled to represen¬ 
tation in the several departments of 
the public service but they will 
not get it until they do their duty 
at the polls defeating the office 
holders responsible for the outrag¬ 
eous treatment they are receiving. 

As a solution to this problem 
I would suggest the calling of a 
convention of the colored voters 
of this city and county to be made 
up of delegates appointed by the 
churches and other race organiza¬ 
tions. Let the delegates in the 
convention carefully consider these 
discriminations in the public ser¬ 
vice with a view of devising ways 
and means of changing conditions. 

Office holders who dodge giving 
the race a square deal on the plea 
that they are afraid of race preju¬ 
dice must be replaced by men 
strong enough to perform their 
duties regardless of race or race 
prejudice. 

The dead have been awakened 
the harvest is ripe, we must pause 
no longer. Keep up the fight 
the people are with you. I am 
yours for our common rights

INDISCREET UTTERANCE AT 
THE PECK RECEPTION 
HURTFUL TO THE CHURCH 


THE A. M. E. CHURCH SLAN¬ 
DERED 


Some one has said: “That a 
glib tongue and an empty head 
is no small calamity.” 

This has been made painfully 
evident by the Los Angeles dele¬ 
gation which recently went to 
Kansas City to make Rev. Peck 
Peck bishop. 

At the reception tendered them 
last week, one of the delegates, 
discussing Rev. Peck’s defeat, said 
that: “Rev. Peck could have been 
elected bishop if he had stooped.” 

This statement not only reflected 
upon the integrity of the four good 
and capable men elected to the 
bishopric and the Conference elect¬ 
ing them, but upon the entire A. 
M. E. Connection. Although Rev. 
Peck was present and heard that 
damaging assertion repeatedly 
made he let it go unchallenged 
thus placing his stamp of approval 
upon it. What opinion of the 
Church must the young people 
have who listened to the addresses 
delivered, by the delegates that 
evening? That a man must 
stoop to be elected bishop! There 
is not a word of truth in it no matter 
who made the statement. It was 
merely a question of standing; 
and those who couldn’t stand, 
fell. 

One gentleman who went to 
Kansas City to sing Rev. Peck 
into the bishopric, said that the 
women were so captivated by his 
wonderful voice that they made a 
rush to make his acquaintance; 
and when informed that he was 
married they made a rush to be 
his friends just the same. 

It may be all right to tell that 
story in a pool room, but it was 
out of place in a church. If you 
are looking for them you can find, 
anywhere, - silly women chasing 
strange men and profligate men 
chasing strange women. Keep to 
yourself the discoveries you make 
while gazing upon such scenes, 
for “ Evil communications corrupt 


good manners . And good morals 
as well. 


PRESIDENT OF THE AFRO- 
AMERICAN COUNCIL SPEAKS 
ILL OF THE KANSAS CITY 
NEGROES. 


The president of the Afro-Ameri¬ 
can Council, who is also clerk in 
the Internal Revenue Office, has 
a poor opinion of the colored citi¬ 
zens of Kansas City. Although 
he is a member of no church, Hon. 
Jas. M. Alexander went to Kansas 
City as manager of Rev. Peck’s 
campaign for the bishopric. Of 
course, Rev. Peck lost—as he should 
have clone under the circumstances. 
On his return, Mr. Alexander un- 
blushinglv told of buying his way 
into the conference by corrupting 
a delegate, of being denounced as 
a “California Pimp”, and of his 
corrupt use of money in the interest 
of Peck’s candidacy. He says the 
Negro women of Kansas City are 
all base, the men are all venal and 
the Negro drug store low grog- 
geries. The utter falsity of this 
statement is so apparent that no 
denial is necessary. 

“Discussing Mr. Alexander’s ex¬ 
travagant statements about the 
morals of our Kansas City cousins, 
only one conlcusion can be reached,” 
said a gentleman, “namely: that 
President Alexapder must have 
been taken for a Western ‘green 
horn’ and lured into the Kansas 
City ‘slums,’ which must have been 
encircled by the ‘tender loin’ and 
kept a prisoner till conference 
adjourned.” 

This, of course, is a very char¬ 
itable view to take of Mr. Alex¬ 
ander’s utterances touching the 
good names of the Negroes of 
Kansas City. He undoubtedly saw 
only the denizens of the underworld. 

This whole business is a disgrace 
to the great A. M. E. Church. 
It is the result of intrusting to boys, 
duties that only men can perform— 
an attempt to make muscle do 
the work of brains; it failed. There 
are enough of noble, brainy men 
and women in the First A. M. E. 
Church to fill with dignity, any 
office within its gift; but cold,

selfish ambition pushed them aside. 

Then, too, unfortunately, there 
is a studied attempt in this city 
to discount character and brain, 
but it cannot succeed. The at¬ 
tempt to make leaders of men 
possessing no ability and of doubt¬ 
ful morality can only fail. It 
brings disgrace and retrogression 
to the race, humiliation and shame 
to the families of the men respon¬ 
sible for such folly.

BURR HARRIS FREE 


Burr Harris, charged with the 
murder of Mrs. Haskins of Comp¬ 
ton, some months ago, was ac¬ 
quitted on the first ballot in Judge 
McCormick's court last week. 

The arrest, confinement and trial 
of Harris is an outrage upon him 
individually, upon the Negroes 
whom the District Attorney's office 
is putting bad without cause and 
the tax payers of the whole county. 
There was absolutely no evidence 
against Harris and why he has been 
held is a mystery to many. But 
the records of the District Attor¬ 


ney's office respecting the rights 
of Negroes will explain the whole 
situation. Persons who visited the 
court and heard the testimony 
were utterly at a loss to know why 
the expensive trial was continued 
upon such flimsy testimony. Race 
prejudice comes high everywhere. 

Judge McCormick, to his lasting 
honor, saw to it that the defendant 
had an absolute square deal. His 
rulings were fair at every point. 
Judge McCormick would honor 
any Judicial bench. 

Attorneys Darden and Ceruti 
conducted the case for the defense. 


A CONFERENCE OF THE 
COLORED VOTERS URGED 


From time to time, in the last 
few months, prominent colored men 
have suggested to us the advisa¬ 
bility of calling a conference of 
the leading colored men of this 
city and county. The need of 
united actions touching certain 
conditions confronting the race make 
such a conference very necessary 
at this time. Although the 
Negroe's taxable holdings are rapid¬ 
ly increasing, along with his poli¬ 
tical power, he is losing ground in 
this community in things that 
men prize highest. 

There is a cause for this con¬ 
dition. Let leaders meet in con¬ 
ference, find the cause and apply 
the remedy. 

By all means let us have the 
conference to be composed of, 
say, three delegates from each 
race organization, that is, the Lv- 
ceum, Afro-American Council and 
the Forum, one from each church 
and one to represent each colored 
newspaper. Before that body all 
matters affecting the interest of 
the Negroes could be discussed and 
plans suggested for the education of 
the people concerning their rights 
and power, as citizens and voters. 
Such a. conference to be of any 
practical benefit must be strictly 
non-partisan and purely racial. 

Shall we have the Conference? 
Let us hear from the people. The 
columns of The Liberator are open 
to you.
