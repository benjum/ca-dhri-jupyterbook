32 Cents per Capita for the Education of 
Negro Children; $15 for White Children 

A GROUP OF ALABAMA COUNTIES SPEAK FOR THE SOUTH. 


Commenting upon the decrease 
in illiteracy in this country, in 
the past ten years, “The Times” 
has the following: 

“Between 1900 and 1910 the 
decrease in illiteracy in the popula¬ 
tion over 10 years of age was from 
10.7 to 7.7 per cent. Among native 
whites the per entage decreased from 
4.6 per cent, to 3 per cent. Among 
the colored people there was a de¬ 
crease from 44.5 per cent, to 30.5 
per cent.” 

Whenever the rapid progress 
made by the Negroes, in reducing 
their illiteracy is mentioned, it 
is pointed to in some quarters as 
proof of what certain whites are 
doing to educate the Negroes. 

“Mr. W. J. Edwards, principal 
of Snow Hill Institute, writes that 
in Wilcox County, Ala., (according 
to the report of the State Superin¬ 
tendent of Public Instruction for 
1910) there are 10,758 Negro chil¬ 
dren of school age and 2,00 white 
children. The school expenditure 
in Wilcox County for 1910 was 
$33,952.45, of which $3,339.70 was 
spent on the 10,758 Negro children 
and $30,612.75 was spent on the 
.2,000 white children. The ex¬ 
penditure for Negro children was, 
therefore, less than 32 cents per 
capita; for white children, about 
$15.30 per capitaa. In the seyen 
counties surrounding and touching 
Wilcox County there are, according 
to the same report, 64,285 Negro 
children of school age, for whom 
$47,719.24 was appropriated in 
1910. In these same counties 
there are 21,841 white children 
of school age, who recieve $224,- 


842,32. The tabulated report be¬ 
low indicates the distribution of 
this money:

FARM PROPERTY AMONG 
NEGROES 


The value of farm property owned 
and rented by colored farmers has, 
in the Southern States, increased 
from 30 per cent, to 225 per cent, 
in the last ten years. In Texas, 
for instance, it has gone from $56,- 
000,000 to $113,000,000; in North 
Carolina from 29,000,000 to $81,- 
000,000, and in Georgia from $48,- 
000,000 to $158,000,000. Nor has 


this been merely increased in the 
value of the same land. In these 
ten states the Negroes controlled, 
in 1910, 3,683,154 more acres than 
in 1900. It is not yet possible 
to separate the land owners and 
the renters. We only know that 
the owners have increased in eight 
States from 125,413 to 149,235 in 
these ten years. We dare affirm 
that no class of white peasantry 
in any European State has in the 
face of the most favorable ordinary 
conditions paralled this record 
which the colored people have made 
in the midst of outrage, discrimi¬ 
nation and lawlessness. This is 
the answer which the young post- 
bellum Negro is making to the 
Southern gentleman. —The Crisis. 


EX-COMMISSIONER THEO¬ 
DORE W. JONES OF CHICA¬ 
GO SPEAKS TO A BIG CROWD 
AT THE LYCEUM. 


A full house greeted Mr. Jones 
at the Lyceum last Sunday. Every 
section of the city and vicinity 
was represented. Mr. Jones, who 
served as county commissioner of 
Cook County, Illinois for two years, 
to the credit of all concerned, is 
now living in retirement. He en¬ 
gaged in the transfer business in 
Chicago many years and is now 
well fixed. 

In a style characteristic of a 
business man, he spoke more than' 
an hour, and was listened to with 
the closest attention. Without 
doubt, it was the most inspiring 
address ever delivered at tbe Ly¬ 
ceum. His election, as Commis- 


































TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


sioner, was a case where the office 
sought the man. The colored 
voters of Cook County, suffering 
from many discriminations, decided 
to secure representation on the 
Board of Commissioners. In re¬ 
sponse to their request, a place 
was given them on the Republican 
County ticket. Mr. Jones, being 
a successful business man, was 
requested by the colored voters 
to run, as the white newspapers 
had promised to support the colored 
candidate, provided, that he was 
neither a preacher, professional 
man, or saloon keeper. Mr. Jones 
large transfer business gave him 
an extensive acquaintance with 
business men of every class, to all 
of whom he appealed successfully 
for support. The colored voters 
voted for the Irish, Germans and 
Jews on the ticket, who in turn 
voted for Jones. Mr. Jones in¬ 
vited the Irish,, German and Jew 
candidates on the ticket to speak 
to the colored voters and they had 
him speak to their people. The 
commissioners were elected at 
large, ten for the city of Chicago 
and five for Cook County, outside 
of the city. There were fifty can¬ 
didates for commissioners, on the 
city ticket, the ten receiving the 
highest number of votes would be 
elected. Mr. Jones was one of the 
four receiving the highest vote, 
running many thousands of votes 
ahead of six candidates below him 
on the ticket. 

When the Commissioners met 
to organize for business, Mr. Jones 
held the balance of power, and used 
it for the good of Cook County. 

At that time, colored applicants 
for positions in the public service 
were having the same troubles 
that they are now experiencing 
in this county, under this good 
government rule, so-called. 1 hat 
old stereotyped bluff: “If Negroes 
are admitted, we will resign,” was 
put to the test. Colored matron 
was put in the detention hospital 
’ and the colored voters were given 
representation whenever they were 
entitled to it; but, in the whole city 
and county, there was only one 
resignation, and that was handed 
in at the request of the commis¬ 


sioners. 

To-day colored men and women 
are at work as clerks in every de¬ 
partment of the city and county 
government of Chicago and Cook 
County. In point of efficiency 
the colored clerks are among the 
highest. 

Mr. Jones rendered a lasting 
service, not only to the Negroes 
of Cook County, but to the white 
people as well. By securing lair 
play for the Negroes, he made its 
denial to any white person impos¬ 
sible, and gave certain white 
people an opportunity to learn that 
they could work in the same office 
with Negroes without disadvan¬ 
tage. They also discovered that 
they wouldn’t resign if Negroes 
were appointed. 

Mr. Jones made a talk that any 
one could listen to with profit. 
His narration of his experiences 
as commissioner was intensely 
interesting and the manner with 
which he met and mastered the 
difficulties, incident to his office, 
showed him to be a man richly 
endowed with common sense.. The 
experience gained in making a 
success of his own business enabled 
him to assist in properly handling 
public affairs. 

TRAITORS IN CAMP 



It might as well be understood 
now, as any other time, that in 
the fight for fair play at the County 
hospital, there are several Negro 
traitors in our camp. Notice is 
hereby served upon them that 
their deeds will be exposed in due 
time and ostracism more severe 
than death will be meted out to 
them. 

There will be no repetition of 
the whiskey campaign, when cer¬ 
tain influential gentlemen took 
hush money to the tune of $25.00 
and up. Our women have been 
barred from the opportunity to 
fit themselves to make an honest 
living. And the Negro man that 
has got too much religion to go 
to their rescue is un-worthy of 
confidence and support. Keep on 
the look out for that “conspiracy 
of silence.”

Monday evening, April 29th at 
8 o'clock. Pastors of the various 
churches of Los Angeles and Pasa¬

platform and distinguished men 
representing the city government 
will also take a part in this mass 
meeting. There will be an aug¬

render music. The admission is 
free to everyone, but by tickets. 
The tickets mav be obtained at 
the Y. M. C. A. 831 San Pedro

the work which he is doing and 
his various activities in educational

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE CITIZENS OF LOS ANGELES 
Protesting against the action of the Board of Supervisors in refusing to admit a Colored 
girl to the Nurse Training School at the County Hospital. 


INTRODUCTION 

At a mass meeting held March 
27th, 1912, at Blanchard Hall 

citizens of the County voiced em¬ 
phatic protest against the unjust 
and senseless discrimination be¬ 
ing made against Colored Women 
at the Training School for Nurses 
at the Los Angeles County Hospital. 

Judge Waldo M. York, Fred C. 
Wheeler, Rev. E. W. Kenchin, 
Rev. Dr. S. Hecht, S. P. Johnson, 
J. M. Vena, Rev. Reynold E. 
Blight, Mrs. Nellie M. Reed and 
Mrs. Clara Shortridge Foltz made 
stirring talks against such injustice 
and advocated equal rights for 
all citizens. 

Letters endorsing the objects 
of the Mass Meeting were read 
from Bishop Thomas J. Conaty 
of the Roman Catholic Church 
and from Bishop Joseph H. John¬ 
son of the Episcopal Church. A 
telegram from Prof. W. E. DuBois 
of New York was also read. 

The evil complained of arose 
in the Spring of 1911, when a young 
colored woman, a resident of Los 
Angeles, applied for admission to 
the Training School for Nurses 
connected with the Los Angeles 
County Hospital . Her petition 
was received and filed, and when 
she appeared and requested to be 
admitted to said Training School 
she was refused admission thereto, 
and for no reason other than she 
was a person of color. Several 
months thereafter the matter of 
her refusal was brought to the 
attention of the Superintendent 
of the hospital, whereupon he re¬ 
ferred the matter to the Board of 
Supervisors of Los Angeles County, 
and. the said Board of Supervisors 
after consideration of the same 
referred the matter back to the 
Superintendent for his decision. 
The Superintendent has rendered 
his decision, which is against the 
admission of colored applicants to 
the Training School for Nurses 
at the said hospital. 

After learning the decision of 


the Superintendent a number of 
representative colored citizens pe¬ 
titioned the Supervisors requesting 
them to compel the Superintendent 
of the hospital to admit qualified 
persons regardless of race or color, 
to the Training School for Nurses 
at the County Hospital. A hear¬ 
ing of the petition was duly had 
on November 21st, 1911, after 

which hearing the Supervisors took 
the matter under advisement, and 
up to this time they have neglected 
to bring the matter to a decision. 

The Mass Meeting adopted the 
following resolutions and herewith 
attached are copies of the letters 
from Bishops Johnson and Conaty. 

RESOLUTIONS 

WHEREAS, the Superintendent 
of the Los Angeles County Hospital, 
a public institution, has refused to 
admit colored applicants to the 
Training School for Nurses at the 
County Hospital, and for no other 
reason than that cf color, and, 

WHEREAS, the Board of Sup¬ 
ervisors of Los Angeles County 
has been petitioned by representa¬ 
tive colored citizens asking the 
Supervisors to compel the super¬ 
intendent of the hospital to admit 
all women who are qualified to 
enter said training school, regard¬ 
less of color, for the purpose of 
receiving instruction and training 
therein, and, 

WHEREAS, all citizens of this 
county are entitled to those rights 
and privileges that are concomitant 
with our public institutions, 

BE it, therefore ,Resolved, that 
we, citizens of the State of Califor¬ 
nia and of the County of Los An¬ 
geles, assembled in public mass 
meeting at Blanchard Hall in Los 
Angeles, do hereby earnestly pro¬ 
test against any and all manner of 
discrimination in any of our public 
institutions, because of race or 
color; and we condemn the action 
of the said Superintendent in re¬ 
fusing to admit competent colored 
women to enter the Training School 


for nurses at the said hospital, and, 
BE, it, further Resolved, that 
we condemn also the action of 
the Supervisors, who, by their 
long silence in this matter, have 
acquiesced in and condoned a great 
wrong and injustice committed 
against the colored people of Los 
Angeles County by the Superin¬ 
tendent of said hospital, and 
BE it, further Resolved, that 
every legitimate means be used 
by the fair-minded citizens of Los 
Angeles County, to urge the said 
Supervisors to compel the Super¬ 
intendent of the County Hospital, 
to open the doors of said Training 
School to all meritorious applicants 
upon equal terms, regardless of 
race, color, or creed, or have said 
Superintendent removed from office, 
and, 

BE it further Resolved, that 
these resolutions be forwarded to 
the Board of Supervisors of Los 
Angeles County, and that copies 
thereof be furnished the press.

Mr. Paul M. Nash, 

145 S. Spring St., City. 

My Dear Sir: 

A member of your committee 
called on me the other day to ask 
my sympathy in the matter of a 
protest against the unjust dis¬ 
crimination of colored girls in the 
Training School for Nurses in the 
County Hospital. 

Any movement that will tend 
to remove discrimination by reason 
of color or religion from any public 
service will always have the strong¬ 
est sympathy which I have at my 
command. All citizens are guar¬ 
anteed in equal rights before the 
law and in equal opportunities 
for such office as their ability may 
warrant. It is contrary to the 
very spirit of our American ideals 
to have any one seeking a place 
in the public service, discriminated 
against by reason of color or reli¬ 
gion. Character and competency 
entitle all to receive an equal chance 
in all departments of public ser¬ 
vice. Our colored citizens are 
among those who honor our citi¬ 
zenship and they rank as good 
taxpayers; consequently they are 
entitled to all the privileges that 
belong to their citizenship and moral 
integrity. 

I heartily sympathize with your 
effort to protest against any dis¬ 
crimination against colored women 
in the Training School for Nurses 
at the County Hospital and I feel 
that in your movement you will 
have the support of the best thought 
in this community. 

With best wishes, I am, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Thomas J. Conaty. 


BISHOPS OFFICE 
523 South Olive St. 

Los Angeles, March 27th, 1912. 
Mr. Paul M. Nash, 

Los Angeles, 

My dear Mr. Nash: 

I regret that I cannot be with 
you this evening, but I am writing 
to assure you of my profound 
sympathy with you in your present 
effort. 

Every great college from coast 
to coast receives the colored man 
as a pupil upon entirely equal 
terms. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, 
Berkeley and Wellesley, among 
the first institutions of our country, 
accord your people every privi¬ 
lege. 

I should hardly like to hear that 
the Supervisors of the County of 
Los Angeles and the authorities 
of our public hospital were not in 
sympathy with this just poilcy. 

The colored people have a right 
to claim the teaching in the train¬ 
ing school for which they ask. 
It is their money, paid in large sums 
through taxation, which enables 
the County in part to maintain 
a training school for nurses, and 
they in honor should have a share 
in every one of the privileges which 
their tribute to the County Treasury 
provides. 

Your people have shown in their 
marvellous development through 
these last fifty years a wonderful 
capacity for citizenship, and we, 
their fellow-citizens, should see to 
it that justice is accorded to them 
whenever justice is pleaded in 
their behalf. 

It is my feeling that provision 
should be made immediately for 
the reception of young women of 
your race into the training school 
of the County Hospital, and that 
they should be accepted into that 
Institution upon exactly the same 
terms upon which the colored 
students are received in the great 
Institutions of the land. 

Believe me, 

Very cordially yours, 

Joseph H. Johnson.

TAFT’S JUST JUDGMENT 


President Taft has never done 
a more commendable thing during 
his entire admisistration than he 
did on Wednesday in turning down 
Circuit Judge William C. Hook, 
candidate to succeed the lamented 
Justice John Marshall Harlan on 
the Supreme Court bench of the 
United States. True it is that the 
candidacy of any man who could 
at this late day have rendered so 
illegal and un-American a decision 
as was Judge Hook’s Oklahoma 
“Jim Crow” decision should not 
have been considered. True it 
was also that the railroad decisions 
of the Kansas applicant have been 
considered adverse and hostile to 
popular interests. Protests neither 
weak nor few on that score have 
poured into the White House. 
But Judge Hook, learned in the 
law, stalwart in his opinion and 
able as are few of his contemporary 
jurists, would undoubtedly have 
been appointed had President Taft 
not listened to the protest of colored 
citizens. Therein lies the justice 
of his judgment. In the appoint¬ 
ment of other Southern jurists 
to the Supreme Court, in the ap¬ 
pointments to his cabinet, in the 
appointments of Southern office¬ 
holders, in many of his other acts 
the President has not consulted 
the wishes or the best interests 
of ten million of his fellow citi¬ 
zens, as they see it: But President 
Taft, we believe, has recently ex¬ 
perienced a change of heart and 
a change of policy in this respect. 
Nothing is more clearly demon¬ 
strative of his present policy of 
protecting the citizenship or colored 
citizens than his straightway turn¬ 
ing down of the Jim Crow Judge 
from Kansas.—The Amsterdam 
News.

THREE STEPS IN LIFE 

The roses climb the garden wall, 
They scent the summer air; 

The blue sky leans down over all— 
Birds sing without a care; 

The flowers reach up toward the sun, 
And brighten till the day is done. 
0 life! thou art so fair. 

The shadows lengthen down the 
walk, 

And down my life as well; 

I hear but sorrows moaning talk— 
She loves her grief to tell. 

I scarce do know—I scarce do know 
If skies are blue or flowers grow 
Or birds pipe in the dell. 

The black night droppeth—hangeth 
low; 

But through the rifts I see 
The stars, like beacon fires, to glow 
And flash their lights to me. 

I know—I know full well some day 
The black, dread night will roll 
away— 

Then the dawning I will see.

The voters who believe in fair 
play have decided to test this 
thing by filling the Board with 
broad minded men who are to 
brave to be guilty ^ of the per¬ 
fidy now being practiced upon the 
liberty-loving, self-respecting tax 
payers of this great city and county. 
If the lady nurses at the county 
hospital are as wicked as certain 
members oi the Board c i Super¬ 
visors would have people believe, 
the sooner they resign the better 
for the unfortunates of that insti¬ 
tution. 

The weak-kneed members of the 
Board will be retired and the nurses 
making that grewsome threat,. if 
there be any such, can go with 
them. The voters will decide once 
for all who is to run the county 
hospital, the nurses or the tax 
payers. 


MR. McCABE 


MR. C. J. NELLIS 


Without doubt the biggest man 
on the Board of Supervisors is 
C. J. Nellis. His selection was 
no mistake in any particular. He 
is a successful business man of 
unimpeachable integrity. He is a 
gentleman, young and capable and 
has fully met every demand of his 
office. Having made good every 
pledge, he is justly the pride of 
his district. 

In that nurse-training affair, at 
the County Hospital, Mr. Nellis 
proved his worth as a man and 
representative of all of the people, 
by his open, straight-forward, man¬ 
ly stand for fair play. He proved 
his unfaltering friendship to his 
own race, by being the friend of 
all races. 

Any coward can strike the fallen, 
but all, are safe in the presence of 
the brave.

WILL SUPPLY NURSES FOR 
THE COUNTY HOSPITAL 


The pretended fear in certain 
quarters that the lady nurses at 
the County hospital will resign 
and leave the sick to die for want 
of attention, if Negro girls are ad¬ 
mitted, has given rise to a plan 
to promptly fill with competent 
nurses the place of every heartless 
nurse who resigns. Quiet investi¬ 
gation has revealed the fact that 
for every place at the county hos¬ 
pital, there would be no less than 
three applicants for any vacancy 
that might occur out there; and 
for some places there would be 


As a member of the Board of 
Supervisors, Mr. McCabe has been 
weighed in the balance and found 
wanting. Although he had the 
unanimous support of the colored 
voters of his district, the first 
time they needed his support he 
deserted ' them. This nurse-train¬ 
ing affair is not a race question, 
but one of simple justice, justice 
to all of the people. The friend 
who deserts you when you are 
struggling for justice, forfeits all 
future claims on your loyalty. 
Mr. McCabe has kept under cover 
in the matter, so when he meets 
a prejudiced white voter, he can 
say: “I didn’t help the Negroes.” 
To every Negro he meets he will 
say: “I didn’t say anything against 
your people. I am your friend.” 
The man who cannot stand up 
and be counted in a struggle between 
right and wrong, is too weak to be 
intrusted with conditions where 
such questions arise. 


The Negro who buys a farm in 
California to-day, lays the founda¬ 
tion for future independence. Lands 
that sell for $100 per acre, produce 
annually $50 to $75 per acre. 


The colored people of the city 
will tender Hon. Theodore W. 
Jones a public reception at 1209 
Central Avenue at 3 p. m., Sunday, 
April 21st. The reception will 
be given under the auspices of 
the peoples’ Lyceum. 

Everybody invited.

vice in the city.

KANSAS 


News Scimitar Special 

LITTLE ROCK, Ark, April 
1. The 111,372 Negro voters of 
Arkansas are preparing for a struggle 
against the disfranchisement pro¬ 
posed by amendment No. 11, em¬ 
bodying the “grandfather clause,” 
to be submitted to the people 
at the general election next Sep¬ 
tember. 

They hold the balance of power 
on the liquor question, as well 
as the proposed bond amendment 
and other propositions to be sub¬ 
mitted, in which the 284,298 white 
voters are deeply interested. And 
they are wise enough to make use 
of that power, and are preparing 
to do so in the most effective 
manner. 

Suffrage leagues are being or¬ 
ganized in every township of the 
state where there are Negro voters, 
and this will be followed by a 
state convention to be held in 
Little Rock in April or May. 

Scipio A. Jones, a Negro lawyer 
of Little Rock, who has the confi¬ 
dence and respect of the white 
lawyers, is at the head of the move-
