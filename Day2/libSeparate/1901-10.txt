Judge York’s Masterly Plea 
for Law and Order 


Practical and Theoretical 
Anarchy Defined 

Lynch Law is Anarchy 

Daily Press Not Blameless 

We Have Been Sowing - to 
the Winds 

anarchism in the united 

STATES. 

(Judge Waldo M. York Before the New 
Century Club. 

Anarchism, as the term is generally 
understood in the United States, is the 
political policy of social existence 
without political laws and without rul¬ 
ers or heads of government, and in 
fact without any officers at all. An¬ 
archists seem not to be unanimous in 
political theories, for some are re¬ 
puted to be so opposed to any govern¬ 
ment that they regard it a virtue to 
kill public officers, while others would 
haim no one, but would endeavor to 
establish by moral suasion the condi¬ 
tions which they consider a panacea for 
all our ills. 

But anarchism is not confined to 
those who profess to be anarchists. 
Any person who would subvert the laws 
of a state or of a nation and deprive 
oiliers of their rights guaranteed to 
them by the constitution and laws of 
ihe United States or of a state while 
condemning anarchy is advocating an¬ 
archistic policies and aiding in their 
promulgation. 

As to that class denominated the 
ied-handed professed anarchists, we 
are hardly in a mood to discuss their 
creed dispassionately. Through the.r 
insl ] uinenta!ity we have been deprived 


of our great and good President by the 
most outrageous assassination — a 
President whose heart was melting 
with kindness toward all the people 
whose life was one-of devotion to the 
people—who as a statesman, citizen, 
husband, Christian and noble gentle- 
man was entitled to the kindliest re¬ 
gards and consideration of every man, 
woman and child in the land—the 
greatest man of his age, whose glori¬ 
ous life was crowned by the halo of 
Ins Christian death and who has left 
to posterity the heritage of a life 
which will ever serve as a model for 
right living, high resolve and exalted 
patriotism! It was through the perni¬ 
cious influence of this class that the 
gentle Empress of Austria was 
stabbed in the back, that the president 
of France and King Humbert of Italy 
were assasinated in a cowardly man¬ 
ner. 

THE LAST PLACE FOR ANARCHY. 

In this country, where our Declara¬ 
tion of Independence declares that all 
men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
inalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty and the pursuit of hap¬ 
piness,, and where in our own state, 
as ni many others, that declaration has 
been euacted into constitutional law 
wherein it is provided that all men are 
by nature free and independent and 
have certain inalienable rights, among 
which are those of enjoying and de¬ 
fending life and property, acqiur.ng, 
possessing and protecting property and 
pursuing and obtaining safety and hap¬ 
piness , and where in the constitution 
of the United States it is declared that 
no person shall be deprived of life, lib¬ 
erty or property without due process 
of law, and cruel and unusual punish¬ 
ments are prohibited; in this country 
where brotherly love has permeated 
the work of the legislatures and so 
many provisions are made for the care 
by the public of those who are unfor¬ 
tunate; In this country of free public 
schools, where the poorest people have 


the same school privileges as the rich 
whether they contribute toward the 
support of the schools or not; in this 
country, where wages of labor are the 
highest in the world and there aremore 
opportunities for employment than in 
any other country; in this country, 
where the avenues to the highest posi¬ 
tions, including professional, commer¬ 
cial and political, are open to the sons 
of the poorest, and where the sons of 
the poorest people have achieved the 
highest places in professional, com¬ 
mercial and political stations; where 
the wealthiest men were poor boys, 
the greatest lawyers, ministers and 
doctors are the sons of laborers,and our 
martyred President himself rose from 
the ranks of rural toilers; where mil¬ 
lions have suffered and given their 
lives to secure and to sustain these 
conditons what possible excuse has 
there been, what possible excuse ex¬ 
ists for the anarchist or for the enemy 
of our form of government? In such 
a country as this the anarchist can 
only be looked upon as the enemy of 
the people, the enemy of his God, the 
enemy of justice, honesty, order and 
decency. His doctrines would stop all 
industry, all progress, all morality.and 
convert the best government on earth 
into blackened ruins, and inaugurate 
famine, pestilence and an earthly hell. 
We will not dignify the red-handed an¬ 
archist by further discussion of his 
abominable creed. 

IN A MILDER FORM. 

Only a step removed is the anarchist 
who is opposed to government, but 
would not murder officers of the law. 

He aids, perhaps unconsciously, the 
red-handed anarchist in that he sup¬ 
ports the no-government creed. We 
w.sh to rid this country of these pro¬ 
fessed anarchists. They are our ene- 
ni.es because they are the enemies to 
om* government. They claim freedom 
cl speech. They claim it under the 
laws which they would destroy. They 
claim it in the enforcement of laws by 
officers whose authority they deiiy. 
They are entitled to it, as they are not 

















2 


THE LIBERATOR. 


excepted in the general provisions for 
the protection of the people. But free¬ 
dom of speech does not mean and has 
never meant in this country a license 
to subvert our morals. The right of 
freedom of speech cannot be invoked 
to license the circulation of obscene 
literature or the utterance of obscene 
thoughts in public places. For the 
sarne reason anarchical utterances 
should he prohibited and freedom of 
speech would remain, under such pro¬ 
hibition, inviolate. 

As to the character of the drastic 
measures which should be provided 
for the suppression of anarchy, I will 
leave that for more mature reflection. 

THOSE WHO GIVE AID AND COM¬ 
FORT. 

I wish now to follow the doctrine of 
anarchism out of the anarchist camps. 
The murderer, the robber, the thief, 
and other violators of law are not de¬ 
nominated anrchists. They do not 
advocate anarchy; they practice it. 
They do not aid the anarchist in the 
promulgation of his doctrine, because 
every man’s hand is against them and 
their hands are against every man. 
They make no pretense of befriending 
anyone. They know and feel that they 
are wrong-doers. They are anarchists 
in practice, but not in theory. 

But we have those with us who are 
more dangerous to the country than 
than these; not professed anarchists, 
but anarchists in sympathy and in 
fact. They give aid and comfort to the 
vilest, most treacherous assassins. 
Angered that their ways and their pol¬ 
icies were not President McKinley’s 
ways and policies, they rejoiced that 
he had become the victim of the as¬ 
sassin’s bullets. Although the Presi¬ 
dent was shot by one humble and un¬ 
known, to whom he had trustingly ex¬ 
tended the hand of friendship, this 
despicable class of people were heard 
shamelessly to remark, “Served him 
right. Hope he will die.” What better 
than the miserable assassin were these 
people? Whatever else may be said of 
him, he had the nerve to jeopardize his 
life in committing his abominable deed. 
They applauded. How can their con¬ 
duct be construed other than tnat they 
had the heart to do as the assassin 
did, but lacked the courage? They fa¬ 
vored, endorsed and endeavored to jus¬ 
tify a red-handed anarchical assassina¬ 


tion as villainous as a human being 
could devise. There should be a law 
to deal with such people. 

DISRESPECT FOR THE LAW. 

When Carrie Nation started her 
hatchet campaign against the saloons 
she subverted the laws and assumed to 
usurp the government in so far as the 
saloon keepers were concerned. In 
defiance of the laws and the officers of 
the law, she assumed to dictate that 
saloon keepers’ acts were crimes and 
that without trial they should be pun¬ 
ished as she in hey own unbridled dis¬ 
cretion might decree. Her position 
was in direct line with the teachings 
of anarchists. Her acts were argu¬ 
ments for the annulment of all laws 
and the deposing of all law officers. 
And yet many men whose hearts were 
bitter against the saloon, who believed 
it to be the greatest crime of our so¬ 
ciety, good men, applauded Carrie Na¬ 
tion’s lawless acts! They were un¬ 
consciously applauding anarchism! We 
can well believe the report that this 
same Carrie Nation said in her speech 
at Coney Island on the 14th of last 
month, that she was glad President 
McKinley had been shot and hoped he 
would die—that he was a friend of 
rum-sellers and brewers and did not 
deserve to live. 

EFFECT OF LYNCH LAW. 

The anarchist, the red-handed an- 
anchist, receives aid and comfort from 
another and a very considerable class. 
This country has long been disgraced 
by what is termed lynch law. It is an¬ 
archy in the disguise of righteous pub¬ 
lic indignation. Men accused of crime 
have in numerous instances been taken 
by mobs and most cruelly treated and 
have been deprived of life without a 
semblance of a trial and in a maddened 
ferocious frenzy, where reason was de¬ 
throned. And the details of these 
atrocities have been telegraphed over 
the world and read by millions. The 
moral sensibilities, the rennement in¬ 
cident to our birth, education and 
usual environments have been blunted 
by these recitals of brutal deeds as 
well as by the witnessing of them, and 
the taking of human life by unlawful 
violence has so familiarized the people 
With such atrocities that brutal lynch- 
ings have been thought lightly of and 
even public journals, and in some in¬ 
stances prominent legislators have 
voiced their approval. What justifica¬ 


tion does the red-handed anarchist 
want more than that? He is taught 
that the laws are inefficient, that offi¬ 
cers of the law are impotent and that 
the people applaud the dethroning of 
the law and brutal assassination. 
What wonder that the taking of the 
life of our grand and gentle President 
under base betrayal of confidence could 
have been so coldly and heartlessly 
done? What wonder that men accred¬ 
ited by their friends with good, pur® 
and tender emotions applauded the 
brutal deed? We have sowed to the 
wind! 

LABOR UNIONS. 

But there are others. It is wrong to 
say that labor unions are responsible 
for all the wrong done by labor union¬ 
ists. Many times they are at fault. I 
do not think they advocate violence. 
But what they advocate has often led to 
violence. I cannot believe that any con¬ 
siderable body of men would advocate 
the brutal maiming of a woman en¬ 
gaged in taking food to her husband, 
who was working honestly and law¬ 
fully to support his family and himself. 
I cannot believe that any body of men 
organized as labor unionists would ap¬ 
prove of the maiming of non-union la¬ 
borers who were pursuing an bonoi'- 
able calling and a calling in which 
safety was guaranteed to them by the 
constitution of this state and of the 
United States. But the bitter invective 
against independent laborers by union¬ 
ists and by.an unscrupulous press and 
demagogical politicians has been as 
flames that have fed the fires of that 
lawlessness which only yesterday 
caused a bloody riot in San Francisco. 
The right of a laborer to refuse to join 
a union is just as sacred as that of an¬ 
other to join a union. Each should 
be protected in his constitutional 
lights and each should be punished for 
infringement of the constitutional 
rights of others. Here is more aid 
and comfort for him who would de¬ 
stroy all law and depose all officers of 
the law. For, if one can maim another 
and prevent him from carrying on his 
work without pretense of lawful right 
so to do, why cannot the anarchist, 
with some semblance of justification, 
say: “Fie upon your laws. They are 
made for classes, not for all the people! 
See the laws broken with impunity! 
Sec- the officers of the law impotent to

afford a remedy! Why not abolish the 
law altogether? Here is a school 
where anarchical doctrines are unwit¬ 
tingly taught. These people are sow¬ 
ing to the wind—what shall they 
reap?” 

THE STRIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO. 

With reference to the strike in San 
Francisco, I have heard mutterings for 
another vigilance committee. Only to¬ 
day 1 read in an article by a very 
prominent man a recommendation for 
the establishment of such a committee 
in San Francisco. The reference is to 
the very celebrated vigilance commit¬ 
tee that usurped the government of 
San Francisco, ignored the law, de¬ 
prived the officers of the law of their 
authority and by unlawful force ad¬ 
ministered a code of laws of their own 
dictation and actually executed several 
men who undoubtedly deserved hang¬ 
ing, and came exceedingly near exe¬ 
cuting an innocent man. I have often 
heard the exploits of the vigilance com¬ 
mittee applauded by men whom I have 
believe to be honest and whom I be¬ 
lieved felt patriotic. Much good to the 
society ~of San Francisco has been 
claimed as a result of the work of that 
vigilance committee.’ 

FRUITS OF VIGILANCE!COMMITTEE 
Following social events in San Fran¬ 
cisco from that time, I fail to see the 
benefits of the operations of that com¬ 
mittee. San Francisco has not been 
noted above other cities of its popula¬ 
tion fo$* its political purity or its high 
moral conditions. Had her citizens 
depended upon the law and used 
their efforts through the law instead of 
against it, the arm of the law would 
have gained strength where it be¬ 
came weak. Dependence would now be 
placed on the law instead of on a vig¬ 
ilance committee to act in defiance of 
the law. Let us analyze the work of 
this committee. It will be readily con¬ 
ceded that the men engaged in the 
work of the committee were good and 
brave men—that they believed they 
were doing their duty 5 . and that .they 
sacrificed their, personal -comfort and 
mopey in carrying on. the work. Bui 
it was unlawful. They violated,the con¬ 
stitution of the United Stales, otjthis 
State and. the statutory laws of this 
state. They, set at : naught, and, defied 
the officers of the law. Had any one 
suggested that their acts were anarchi¬ 


cal they would have been furious In 
their indignation. 

But If it was right for them to 
trample the laws under foot and de¬ 
pose the officers of the law, why can 
not the anarchist say: “My creed is 
the same. It only goes further on the 
same lines and for a different object. 
If it is right for them to depose the 
government, why Is It wrong for me 
to do so?” 

ORGANIZED LAWLESSNESS. 

San Francisco has had Its organized 
lawlessness since that against which 
the vigilance committee bravely con¬ 
tended. Though lawless in the oppo¬ 
site sense, they had a precedent. It la 
not enough to say in justification that 
the vigilance committee usurped the 
government and deposed the consti¬ 
tuted authorities for good purposes. 
Who is to judge of the purposes? I 
fear that even the far-famed vigilance 
committee sowed to the wind. 
DISOBEDIENCE OF BAD ,LAWS. 

I have known men to advocate dis¬ 
obedience to laws on the pretext that 
such laws were more honored in the 
breach than in the . observance. On 
this principle one preson will violate 
one law and another person will vio¬ 
late another law. Another man may 
find no laws to his liking. I knew a 
man who advocated the violation of 
the university liquor law at Berkeley, 
on the ground that it was more hon¬ 
ored in the breach than in the obsarv- 
ance. All laws ,made for the regula¬ 
tion or restriction of the liquor traf¬ 
fic are unpopular with those whose 
business is curtailed by them. Many 
find such laws more profitable in the 
breach than in the observance, and the 
officers have ever had to be watchful 
to prevent such laws from being gen¬ 
erally violated. What of such law vio¬ 
lators? Friends or enemies to republi¬ 
can government? The laws whereof it 
is said,“They are more honored in their 
breach than in their observance” are 
generally laws made to prevent vice 
and. remove bad temptations from the 
yoking. Those violators of law are un¬ 
consciously instructors in anarchism. 
It is on the same principle that an¬ 
archists would do away with all laws. 
* Those men are sowing the wind. >r 
CORRUPT U$E OF MONEY. ; 

Those who with the use of money 
debauch weak electors or corrupt offi¬ 


cials, would sell their country for a 
temporary gain. The use of capital to 
induce voilations of the law, to encour¬ 
age unlawful combinations against the 
interests of the people, to degrade de¬ 
pendent men, puts into active practice 
the doctrine of anarchists, approves 
their methods and tends to break down 
the government which stands for law 
and order in opposition to no law, and 
the disorder of anarchical conditions. 
The men who do these things would 
pollute the fountain, careless of the 
misery that their poison might entail. 

They are manufacturing arguments 
for anarchist®. What can they expect 
that they and their children will reap 
from such a sowing? 

OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. 
But there is a numerous class of an¬ 
archistic teachers—good, whole-souled 
people, but not so thoughtful as good 
American citizens should be. They 
advocate lyinching and mob violence, 
although most of them would harm no 
one themselves. 

In a recent paper published under the 
eaves of the State University at Ber¬ 
keley, I read in startling headlines, 
“Student Whips a Traitor! Anarchist 
Kicked Off Car. Patroitic Student Ad¬ 
ministers a Trashing to Self-Confessed 
Red!” Then follows an account of an 
assault by a student on a man who 
said he was an anarchist. There was 
no law against a man’s declaring him¬ 
self an anarchist. If there had been 
such a law the man charged with its 
violation would have been entitled to 
a fair and impartial trial In a court of 
competent jurisdiction before punish¬ 
ment could have been administered. 
The student, therefore, violated the 
law. He had usurped the government 
and was acting in the role of an abso¬ 
lute dictator. In subverting the law 
and infringing upon the constitutional 
rights of another, he was unwittingly 
practicig anarchical doctrine. The 
newspaper, in applauding him and the 
crowd who jeered at the victim were 
applauding practical anarchy, while 
they condemned theoretical anarchy. 
The student was not invidiously stand¬ 
ing alone. He was urged on by a pub¬ 
lic sentiment, and that public senti- 
- .ment was anarchical. After the assas¬ 
sination of Abraham Lincoln, I, a stu¬ 
dent, did the same act. I can believe 
that only the best of motives inspired 














4 


THE LIBERATOR. 


him. I expect him to have more accu¬ 
rate ideas of true patirotUm as his 
years mature. But that public senti¬ 
ment—what of that? 

What of that public sentiment which 
inspired the mob that surrounded the 
jail in Chicago where anarchists were 
confined? What of the public senti¬ 
ment which applauded the brutal at¬ 
tack on a poor lunatic who voted “no" 
on the adoption of resolutions of re¬ 
spect and condolence in memory of 
President McKinley at Sixth street 
park in Los Angeles? 

These are but a few straws to the 
many evidences of the trend of public 
opinion. 

PRESIDENT M’KINLEY'S EXAMPLE 

What a rebuke to them are the 
words the great President bequeathed 
to his people after he had been mor¬ 
tally wounded by one of the most de¬ 
spicable of human beings, and the as¬ 
sassin had been roughly hurled to the 
floor: • “Don't hurt him." How differ¬ 
ent this great, loyal American citizen 
from those of his friends who demand¬ 
ed the assassination of the assassin! 

PUNISHING THE ASSASSIN. 

It was said that the assassin ought 
to be strung up without a trial? By 
whom? Under what law? It could 
not have been done without subvert¬ 
ing the law and overcoming the officers 
of the law. And this would have 
been in line with the teachings of an¬ 
archists. Stop, think, my kind friende, 
you of the patriotic feeling. Is not 
your teaching anarchical? Do you not 
advise sowing to the wind? 

Oh, that the noble words of that 
noble man could take root in the hearts 
and minds of the American people. 
Then, indeed would anarchy receive a 
mortal blow. Let the anarchical teach¬ 
ings be dissipated from our own fire¬ 
sides; from the public press. Let the 
law be obeyed by those who are not 
professed anarchists. Let our people 
be not hardened by cruelty and law¬ 
lessness, but refined by law and or¬ 
der. Remove the excuses for the ex¬ 
istence of anarchy—stay the careless 
sowing of anachical seeds, and then 
we may consistently apply drastic laws 
for utter annihilation of anarchism.

delivered by Superintendent Foshay re

PROF. J. A. FOSHAY. 


who hag the wellbeing of the country 
at heart. The conditions confronting us 
today must be met by men and women 
of lofty patriotism who will not sup¬ 
port a wrong because it is popular. A 
wrong not openly denounced is silently 
endorsed: 

• • * • “On all sides we see 

growth and expansion of educational 
work. The city of Los Angeles is ex¬ 
ceptional, as its growth has not been 
so gradual as many of the other cities, 
because of the great influx of people 
within the last decade. Since 1893 we 
have grown from an enrollment of 12,- 
191, and an average attendance of 
8908, to an enrollment of 21,648, and an 
average attendance of 15,891. In 1893 
we had 235 teachers employed. At the 
present we have 543 teachers. 


“There is perhaps no more important 
work of the instructor than to teach 
children how to study. We made a be¬ 
ginning along this line last year and I 
suggest a study period for the different 
classes, at which time the teacher 
should be free to assist the children. 
We have emphasized this subject for 
the present school year, and I hope that 
even more time may be given by each 
teacher to assist pupils In acquiring 
correct habits. This subject of teach¬ 
ing children how to atudy cannot, in 
my opinion, be emphasized too highly. 

“INTEMPERANCE,IDLENESS AND 
EXTRAVAGANCE are doing more to 
destroy our people than foreign enem¬ 
ies. The teachers of today must dig¬ 
nify labor, and assist in establishing 
and maintaining a society whic~ shall 
be composed of self-supporting people. 
The greatest need of this country is 
men of personal worth and stability, 
who will not be swayed from truth and 
right, but who will see to it that Justice 
Is not perverted, and who will do their 
duty by participating in public affairs. 

“The seeds of law-breaking, of an¬ 
archy, are being sown broadcast in our 
midst. THE LACK OF RESPECT 
FOR DAW, COURTS AND OFFICERS 
is teaching ignorant fanatics to go far¬ 
ther, and they become haters of the 
government and plotters against It. 
People who obey only the laws which 
may chance to please them, and evade 
or break those they disllke.are teaching 
the first principles of anarchy, and 
striking at the very foundation of gov¬ 
ernment. EVERY TEACHER should 
not fail to teach reverence for God, to 
enforce order and obedience in the 
schoolroom and to train children to 
love the Institutions of government. 
Our school, then, may thus become the 
nursery In which are inculcated loyalty 
to our beloved country and loyalty to 
our God." 


A BUSINESS MAN’S LEAGUE. 

There is a movement on foot to or¬ 
ganize a colored business man’s league. 
In view of the increasing number of 
colored business and professional men 
in this city, such an organization is 
very necessary, and will be productive 
of much good in stimulating business 
enterprises among our people.

OUR NEW WORK IN AFRICA. 

Fifteenth Annual Convention of the

Angeles, Oct. 8-11, 1901. 

By Mrs. F. L. DONOHOO. 

4 T heard the voice of the Lord say¬ 
ing, whom shall I send and who will 
go for us? Then said I, here am I, 
send me/' Such was the answer of 
Miss Susan Collins, a devoted Chris¬ 
tian woman, more than thirteen 
years ago. This dear sister waB born 
in Illinois, and received her training 
in the Iowa university. She went to 
Africa. "the dark continent," and 
served with Bishop Williams Taylor 
eight years, after which she served 
five years with Bishop Hartzell, mak¬ 
ing thirteen yearB of truly consecrated 
labors for her Master among the be¬ 
nighted heathen. Glorious labor! 
Testimonials from Bishops Taylor 
Hartzell and other workers on the 
field give evidence of her abundant 
success as matron and teacher. Miss 
Collins has lived among us for 
about a year, and has greatly endeared 
herself to ua by her modeBt, Chris¬ 
tian character. "God moves in a mys¬ 
terious way!" A bequest of $500 was 
lefc by a dear young woman for for¬ 
eign missionary work. Her sister 
(Miss Mary Crothers) added to this 
bequest an amount sufficient to send 
Mias .Collins back to Africa and pay 


her salary for three years. After the 
three years shall have expired, the 
Pacific branch of the W. F. M. 3., 
Southern California conference, as¬ 
sures her support. She will return In 
a short time to her choice labors in 
Angola, Africa, by appointment of 
Bishop Hartzell, where she did good 
and faithful work for thirteen years. 

Now, dear sisters, with this brief 
description of the work, and the work¬ 
er, let us pass on to the things that 
should give us new impetus in the for¬ 
eign missionary work. 

If every Christian could, or would be 
impressed with the fact that the mis¬ 
sionary question Is not one of mere 
sentiment, but of uncompromising duty 
that cannot be neglected without dis¬ 
loyalty to Christ, then the foundation 
would be laid for an abiding interest 
in missions. I verily believe the life 
and growth of the church depend on 
missionary activity. Christianity is like 
a fire, that if it doeB not spread, will 
burn itself out. The church that lives 
for itself alone is short-lived. 

There is a necessary and Irrepressi¬ 
ble conflict between right and wrong, 
between truth and error, and between 
light and darkness; and Christianity, 
being the embodiment of truth, light 
and righteousness, must wage war on 
ignorance and sin. Those who profess 
to be adherents of Christianity, and yet 
refuse to aid in this warfare, are not 
only false to the very spirit of Chris¬ 
tianity, but are guilty of sin scarce less 
than downright treason to the cause of 
Christ. Do you know, dear sisters, the 
proposition of foreign missionary work 
is opposed by a great many people be¬ 
cause of the ignorance of the work. 

A brother said to me tne ocher day, 
that he was opposed to foreign mis¬ 
sions. I said, "Well, brother, that is 
because you are ignorant of the work 
it is doing. People will not feel much 
Interested in that of which they know 
so little." Opposlton or indifference to 
mission work is almost always In di¬ 
rect ratio to ignorance concerning it. 
When we assemble In our open meet¬ 
ings, let us tell the story of heroic lives 
of those who have been conspicuous as 
missionaries and Instrumental In 
planting the church of Christ in the 
regions beyond this, is calculated to 
stir the hearts of all with enthusiasm 
for the cause to which they were so 


gloriously devoted. There is ho other 
department of Christian activity that 
offers such opportunities for usefulness 
and success in winning souls for Christ 
as the foreign mission field. Let us 
constantly agitate the subject of for¬ 
eign mission until there shall be no 
soli that is not batised with Christian 
blood and consecrated by missionary 
graves. I fear, dear sisters, and breth¬ 
ren. too. that we are too much taken 
up with self and self-interest. We of¬ 
ten imagine that we are serving God 
when, in fact, we are only serving our¬ 
selves. We forget that he best serves 
God who serves his fellowmen, and 
that Jesus said: “Inasmuch as ye have 
done it unto one of the least of these, 
ye have done it unto me. 

Oh, let us remember that these 
heathen are as truly our sisters and 
our brothers as the people of our own 
Christian land, and that they must 
have the gospel and a Christian civil¬ 
ization to save them. Think of the 
degradation of the heathen, the abom¬ 
inations of ignorance, superstition 
and vice, that prevail among them; 
the poverty and wretchedness, starva¬ 
tion and physical suering which they 
endure; then, dying not to know God! 
When our beloved President William 
McKinley died, our eyes were blinded 
with tears, and grief irrepressible filled 
our hearts, but there was consolation, 
for this man lived so much like his 
Maker and knew him so well that, in 
his dying moments he whispered, 
"Nearer, my God, to Thee!" But the 
heathen does not know God, and can¬ 
not sing "Nearer, to Thee!" Think of 
the contrast! 

"And how shall we escape if we neg¬ 
lect to send the gospel to them. God 
bless the memory of our sainted Sister 
Seymour, whose body we laid to rest 
but yesterday, who, in her life organ¬ 
ized the Pacific branch of the W. F. 
M. S. of Southern California. God bless 
the memory of the dear sister who left 
the bequest for the foreign field. "They 
rest from their labors and their works 
do follow them." And God bless abun¬ 
dantly Miss Mary Crothers, who, by 
her liberal contribution, has made pos¬ 
sible the return of Miss Collins to Af¬ 
rica. And God bless Sister Collins, lir 
her work. And may we, the P. B. of 
the W. F. M. S. rejoice In the advance 
we have made, and do a little more, 
pray a little more, and give a little 
more, until Africa is won for Christ.

MIXING BUSINESS AND RELIGION. 

It is pleasing indeed to note the 
marked increase In the number of col¬ 
ored business men in this city in the 
past year. The fact that they are be¬ 
ginning to diversify their business 
shows that each venture is the result 
of calm deliberation that points to suc¬ 
cess. The negro is beginning to take 
life serious and to no longer regard it 
as all together "one grand sweet song/' 
but a thing to be put to practical use 
If we hope to reap the rewards that 
come of success. If we hope to have 
any say so in.the affairB of the world 
we will have to own a part of it. If 
we hope to have any voice in the man¬ 
agement of this government we will 
have to help do its business, produce 
and own its wealth. If we want the 
respect and confidence of honest, in¬ 
telligent men and women, we have-got 
to be honest, intelligent men and 
women ourselves. The man who has 
no business of his own is not very well 


prepared to run that of others. As it 
is with an Individual *o It Is with a 
race. The day of speech making song 
and dance is over. For every negro 
who makes a living by singing and 
dancing there is a thousand who can't. 
But every negro who is willing to work 
and then save what he makes can 
make himself useful and respected in 
his community. That the negroes are 
learning these golden truths Is being 
demonstrated every day and in every 
section of this country. A colored min¬ 
ister said some time ago that he had 
quit preaching to his congregation 
about tbs beauties of heaven, but 
rather the beauties and blessings of a 
virtuous, useful life. “The beauties of 
heaven," he said, "are fadeless and 
eternad and can be inherited only by 
those who live beautiful lives in this 
world." This is preaching that saves 
in this world and the world to come. 
The man is best prepared to die who 
reaches the highest ideals in this life. 
The fellow who Is too shiftless to 
pluck for himself some of the sweets 
from life's bountiful storehouse is too 
shiftless to travel the straight and nar¬ 
row way that leads from earth to that 
celestial city. The man whose re¬ 
ligion teaches him honesty, industry 
and economy will have power and in¬ 
fluence in his community regardless of 
the color of his skin. 


Elsewhere in these columns will be 
found Judge York’s great speech on 
anarchy. It is a great plea for law and 
order and should be read aloud at the 
fireside of every American home. It 
will strengthen respect for the dignity 
of the law and kindle a patriotic flame 
in the hearts of all who read or heaJT 
it. He handles anarchy in all of its 
phases, pointing out its dangers in a 
manner that must make lawlessness 
hateful and thereby stimulate the 
growth of patriotism. It is a gentle 
breathing of love for country, law, or¬ 
der and humanity. 

r —— : -o-- 

There is a dead preacher in town 
who is becoming offensive.- NoW, if 
his corpse gets too lively we will have 
to take hold of it.

Wonder if the push will call a meet¬ 
ing and exclude that jury from so¬ 
ciety? 


A GREAT MAN AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 

In entertaining Professor Booker T. 
Washington at dinner at the White 
House, President Roosevelt not only 
honored him, hut himself and the 
country as well. It should no longer 
he said that a distinguished citizen like 
Professor Washington has to leave this 
country befork he Can he treated with 
the consideration due man, simply on 
account of his cblor. The Presidents 
acts were those of a high-toned gentle¬ 
man, and deserve neither reward nor 
encomium, but in these days of hypoc¬ 
risy and cant, men with backbone 
enough to be what they .claim to be 
are so rare that when one is found he 
at once becomes a hero. There is a 
great man at the White House, a man 
in whom there is neither hypocrisy nor 
guile—a president of all the people. 


In a conference with the President 
recently Prof. Booker T. Washington 
advised him to give all federal offices 
in the South to respectable white men. 
This in the South means Democrats. 
The President immediately appointed 
ex-Governor Jones of Alabama a life- 
tong Democrat, to a federal judgeship. 
It is a good appointment and should 
be followed by others of a like char¬ 
acter. 


That editor who was to be run in 
for criticizing certain officers of the 
Afro-American League is still at large. 
The fellows that had the matter in 
charge is now wondering'Whether or 
not they had any character to tarnish. 


Since the assassination of President 
McKinley, Ben Tillman, the mob lead¬ 
er, has been a little quiet, the people 
of the north being too grief-stricken to 
listen to his discussions on the beau¬ 
ties of anarchy, lynching, burning and 
ballot thieving. The Y. M. O. A. in 
Iowa cancelled his engagements with 
them. After thinking the matter over 
they came to the conclusion thaX the 
youths of that state could learn to 
murder, rob and raise trouble without 
hiring Tillman to give them special 
instruction.

The Afro-American League 

Some Shady Transactions of 
the Old Seventy-five Cents 
Ballot Brokers 

CHAPTER II. 

There is no better proof that the so- 
called Afro-American League has be¬ 
come innocuous desuetude than the 
statements of its membership given 
out from time to time by the six-bits 
push that use it during campaigns for 
what there is in it. In '96 they did bus¬ 
iness on a fictitious enrollment of 700 
in this city. Two years ago they 
claimed 600, a loss of 100. At the close 
of the last congress they went over 
to the Times office and handed in a 
revised list claiming 400 members, stat¬ 
ing that the names of all democrats 
had been expunged from the roll. From 
this we are led to infer that there are 
300 colored democrats in the city, and 
that these ballot brokers, in a virtu¬ 
ous moment, decided not to use them 
in their future calculations—going to 
do business a little more on the square. 
Then too this would explain to future 
politicians whose legs are to be pulled 
why the league’s enrollment is grow¬ 
ing so beautifully less, while the col¬ 
ored population Is rapidly increasing 
in numbers and intelligence. Now,the 
whole truth of this matter is, there 
never was 700 voters in the league ex¬ 
cept as they existed in the imagination 
of these political fakirs. Armed with 
this imaginary enrollment of voters, 
whose interests they had been selected 
to guard, many and many a “six bits” 
was gathered in, and countless the 
number of cheap cigars harvested. 
Each of these race men (?)—for they 
are always looking out for the race — 
could swim in the beer he has spoiled 
to the health of these 700 imaginary 
leaguers. It was this class of race men 
that has made the name of the league 
a by word and its endorsement a 
“Jonah.’’ There is not an employe in 
the public service in the city today 
who owes his appointment to the 
league’s endorsement; that is, a dili¬ 
gent inquiry failed - to produce one. 
Those spoken to in regard to the league 
spoke of it in very uncomplimentary 
itin-.fi—A JONAI-I. 


The league’s endorsement has been 
so disastrous to the fortunes of those 
who received it in the past that it be¬ 
came to be regarded as a “Jonah.” 
The number of ambitious young col¬ 
ored men in this city who have been 
hopelessly sidetracked by the league’s 
endorsement is quite large. To give 
their names would he speaking disre¬ 
spectfully of the dead—not a safe thing 
to do now. Although the negroes are 
rapidly increasing in numbers, intelli¬ 
gence and wealth in Southern Califor¬ 
nia, the league, according to the state¬ 
ment of its owners, the officers, is rap¬ 
idly losing its members. They ought 
to know, as they are the only ones who 
have access to the roll of membership. 
The league is dead and its proprietors 
know it, but with its corpse, like Cid 
Campeador, though dead, they hope to 
win another victory—do six hits poli¬ 
tics in one more campaign. We shall 
see. 

-o- 

THE HERALD. 

The absolute honesty of the Herald 
in dealing with all public questions, 
and its fairness to all classes of citi¬ 
zens, is rapidly bringing it to the front 
as the organ of the people. While bat¬ 
tling for the rights of the laboring 
classes it has assailed no rights of the 
capitalists. To no class has it shown 
greater friendship than to the colored 
citizens. The following editorial from 
the Herald speaks for itself: 

NEGRO HATRED IN KENTUCKY. 

The recent lynching of two negro 
boys in Kentucky tends to confute a 
familiar argument in extenuation of 
such atrocities in the South. A certain 
phase of crime is usually the incentive 
to summary vengeance upon southern 
negroes. Similar retributive acts in 
northern states are pointed to as evi¬ 
dence that lynching for such cause is 
likely to occur in any state. It i» 
claimed that the horror of such a crime 
stirs northern communities to the 
lynching point just as quickly as it 
affects one in the south. 

But the case alluded toinKentucky is 
evidence that race prejudice is a strong 
factor in the outrages perpetrated up¬ 
on southern negroes. The young ne¬ 
groes who were lynched were only 16 
and 18 years old respectively. The 
meager report merely states that they 
were charged with having “stoned to 
death” a printer, with whom they bad 
presumably quarreled. The culprits 
were arrested and incarcerated in the 


jail at the county seat of Shelbycounty. 
From this jail they were taken by a 
mob, without further opposition than 
the sheriff’s protest, and hanged from 
a railway trestle. 

It Is evident that if these boys had 
happened to be white no suen method 
of vengeance would have been em¬ 
ployed. They were lynched because it 
was their misfortune to be black. Th# 
spirit thus manifested is perceptibly 
growing throughout the south, and it 
threatens to result in serious trouble 
between the races. It is strengthened 
and encouraged by the official action 
of the southern states in attempts to 
rob the negroes of the rights guaran¬ 
teed to them by the fifteenth amend¬ 
ment of the federal constitution. 


mr. McClellan. 

The jury in the McClellan libel case, 
after being out ten minutes, returned 
a verdict of not guilty. The trouble 
grew out of the following publication 
in the Record of September 18: 

“WARNING TO THE PUBLIC. 

Beware of those brothers in black 
who are going around collecting money 
under the pretense that the colored 
people want to hold memorial services 
by themselves. The colored people are 
loyal American citizens; the majority 
of them desire to pay honor to the 
President in that way. 

“These people are going around un¬ 
der pretense of hall rent and other ex¬ 
penses and are simply trying to fleece 
the public. While the people are grief 
stricken over the loss of the President, 
they have worked up a scheme to make 
some money out of it. Respectfully, 
“T. M. M’CLELLAN, 

739 Maple avenue. 

“Los Angeles, September 18, 1901.” 

In the future all self-appointed dollar 
chasing committees will be looked upon 
with suspicion and will receive a chilly 
reception. The jury’s verdict meets 
with general approval, and sounds the 
death knell of this “finance committee” 
business, for which the public is ex¬ 
ceedingly grateful. A finance hunting 
committee may be all right, hut there 
can be no harm in keeping it a safe 
distance. In the future, if the colored 
people would make the speakers pay 
the hall rent for the hall in which they 
hold memorial services, there will never 
be another memorial service held in 
this city between now and the sound¬ 
ing of Gabriel’s signal. These fellows 
who are so generous with their elo¬ 
quence never have any money. They 
usually have a “finance committee.” 
The first thing you know the Afro- 
American league will get up a “finance 
committee.” There is nothing like 
having “finance.”
