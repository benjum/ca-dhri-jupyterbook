VOL. III. 

A Colored Preacher 
Lynched 

for being a Leader of His Race. 


The Old Rape Racket has Played 
Out, but Lynching 
Must Go On. 

t 


CLEVELAND, (Miss.) July 21.—This 
morning at 1:30 o’clock a band of 
armed negroes, one of whom was 
knowp, rode into Cleveland, and scop- 
ping a party of three white men on tire 
stree^,. made threatening demonstra¬ 
tors. Being called upon to give their 
names they answered by bringing their 
1 tries into play. One of the negroes was 
killed on the spot, another was found 
on the outskirts of town, and the 
others escaped, although it is supposed 
that more than three were hurt. They 
were armed with Winchester rifles, and 
were well mounted. 

Excitement was at fever heat during 
the remainder of the night. Squads of 
aimed men patroled the streets until 
daylight. 

The trouble grew out of the lynching 
of Jesse Phillips, the colored preacher, 
in the earlier part of the night The 
negroes in this section are organized 
into “lodges,” ‘‘secret orders” and ‘ pro¬ 
tective societies,” and as Phillips was a 
leader among them, it was feared that 
an attempt would be made to avenge 
his death. The fact had developed that 
the killing of young ReicI was a stud¬ 
ied scheme on the part of the negroes. 

It has been decided that the break¬ 
ing up of these negro organizations is 
necessary, and there is no doubt that 
this decision will be enforced. The 
town is quieter today than is usually 
the case, even on Sunday. 


LOS ANGSLES, CAL., AUGUST, 1901. 


MOB HANGS TWO WOMEN. 

Mother, Daughter and Son the 
Victims. 

CARROLLTON, Miss., Aug. 3.—The 
brutal murder of Mr. and Mrs. R. A. 
Taliaferro on the night of July 30, led 
tonight to the lynching of Betsie Mc¬ 
Cray, her son Belfield McCray and her 
daughter Ida McCray, all colored. A 
mob composed of about five hundred 
white citizens of Carroll county, who 
marched to the jail in order, demanded 
the keys from Jailer Duke, proceeded 
to the cells of the negroes, bound them 
by the neck and hands and carried 
them to the corporate limits of the 
town, where they hanged them to a 
tree by the public roadside and riddled 
their bodies with bullets. 

The mob resisted the earnest appeals 
of Judge W. F. Stephens and W. H. 
Hill, who stood on the steps of the jail 
and appealed to them in the name of 
law and order. They even followed the 
mob to the cell doors with their arms 
around the necks of the leaders, plead¬ 
ing with them to let the law take its 
course, but with no effect. 

Ida McCray confessed knowledge of 
the murder and stated that her mother 
Betsie and brother Belfield helped com¬ 
mit the crime. She further implicated 
others, who will probably meet a like 
fate. Betsie McCray refused to make 
any statement. 

Governor A. H. Longino arrived on 
the scene by special train from Jackson 
a few minutes after the lynching. He 
addressed a large and attentive audi¬ 
ence at the courthouse, impressed upon 
them the duty of their citizenship, and 
obedience to law and order. The most 
prominent citizens of the country la¬ 
bored with the excited mob all during 
the day to allow the law to take its 
course, but without avail. 


That a condition worse than slavery 
is existing in many parts of the South 
goes without saying. The hanging of 
a minister of the gospel for being a 


No. 1. 


leader of the race, shows a disregard 
for human life and a contempt for the 
constitution and laws of the country 
that is unparalleled in its history. It 
has been the claim of the Southern 
people all along that the negroes were 
only lynched when charged with the 
commission of certain crimes, but the 
rape racket has played out and the 
mobs of Mississippi have boldly an¬ 
nounced that negroes are hereafter to 
be lynched for any and all offenses or 
for no offense. The announcement that 
for a negro to be a member of a secret 
order such as a Mason, Odd Fellow or 
K. of P. is sufficient provocation for 
lynching him is such a flagrant viola¬ 
tion of the constitutional guarantee 
that unless checked will lead to a con- 
tion that would be vastly worse than 
the re-enslavement of the negro race. 
This statement may seem rather 
strong, but it is warranted by 
the existing condition in that section. 
Only a few days ago a negro was lyn¬ 
ched in that state for stealing a bot¬ 
tle of pop and two glasses. Could a 
condition more deplorable be imagined? 
Surely and rapidly this country is 
drifting on to an awful revolution. The 
conditions are ripe, lawlessness is on 
the increase and the prospects are 
good that rivers of blood will flow be¬ 
fore this generation passes away. But 
we are prosperous; we are making 
money. 


MARRIAGE NOT A FAILURE. 

A New York minister says marriage 
is not a failure, and that more than 
2500 of the 3012 couples he has united 
are happy. His advice to those who 
would wed and be happy is largely 
summed up in the following half-dozen 
dont’s: Don’t marry when too young. 
Don’t marry until you can support a 
wife. Don’t marry a girl who can’t 
cook and sew. Don’t live in six 
rooms when three are enough. Don’t 
marry unless you suit each other. Don’t 
come to me for a divorce.

THE LIBERATOR. 


Mississippians 

Entertained 

At South Pasadena. 

They Visit John Brown's Daughter 

Mrs. Anna S. Gray, principal of the 
Greenwood colored graded school, of 
Greenwood, Mississippi, and Miss Sara 
A. Page, teacher at Canton, Mississippi, 
were the guests of Mr. and Mrs. J. L. 
Edmonds during their stay in Los An¬ 
geles. Mr. and Mrs. Edmonds are 
former citizens of the Mississippi and 
Yazoo Delta, where Mrs. Gray is now 
teaching, and knew just how to make 
Mrs. Gray and Miss Page feel at home 
Their meeting with Mr. Edmonds was 
a singular coincidence. When the la¬ 
dies came into the Arcade depot, see¬ 
ing a reception committee badge pin¬ 
ned to the lapel of his coat, they re¬ 
quested him to care for their hand- 
baggage till they could look after their 
trunks, not knowing that they were 
in the hands of an old Mississippian, 
who was then looking for friends from 
his former home, that he might make 
their visit to Southern California pleas¬ 
ant. It goes without saying that they 
were, very agreeably surprised, and 
while being entertained they also en¬ 
tertained the entire family with their 
interesting talks on the general ad¬ 
vancements that are being made by the 
race in the South, especially in Missis¬ 
sippi. Mrs. Gray and Miss Page were 
classmates and both graduates from 
the Tuggoloo, Mississippi, Normal and 
Industrial Institute, and are cultured, 
up-to-date teachers, whose culture and 
refinement will bless the young women 
who come within the radius of their 
influence. They are both widely 
read and possess much practical knowl¬ 
edge outside that gained from their 
school books. The fact that we have 
hundreds of just such young ladies in 
the South bespeaks for the race a 
bright future. On Saturday evening, 
July 13th, Mr. Edmonds took them, ac¬ 
companied by Miss Moore of Los An¬ 
geles, to the principal points of inter¬ 
est in the Angel City, visiting the city 


hall and the public library and cham¬ 
ber of commerce, where they met and 
were introduced to the Hon. M. P. 
Snyder, mayor of the city; then they 
visited the office of the great Los An¬ 
geles Daily Times, where they were 
very cordially received and a young 
white man, an employe, was detailed to 
show them through the building. The 
visit to the composing room was es¬ 
pecially interesting, as scarcely any¬ 
thing could be heard but the hum and 
clatter of more than twenty typesetting 
machines that were running, making 
the mammoth Sunday Times. Gen. 
Otis, the editor, seemed pleased with 
the visit and took a deep interest in 
the visitors and invited them to call 
again at 10:30 o’clock and see the pa¬ 
per stereotyped. After luncheon Sun¬ 
day, accompanied by Miss Susie, Mr. 
Edmonds took them for a drive 
through Pasadena, the most beautiful 
city in the west. They went first to the 
house of Mrs. Ruth Brown Thompson, 
the daughter of John Brown, the liber¬ 
ator, where they met both Mr. and 
Mis. Thompson and their daughter. It 
was an affecting scene. On learning 
that their visitors were from far-away 
Mississippi both of the dear old people 
wept. After spending a pleasant half 
hour we took our leave. For the 
young ladies it was the Mecca of their 
trip. A mile down through the wilder¬ 
ness of millionaire palaces that line 
Orange Grove avenue brought us to the 
beautiful Colorado street. A half mile 
drive through that street, a visit to the 
Throop Polytechnic Institute,the public 
library and a drive through Raymond 
and Fair Oaks avenues concluded what 
was indeed a pleasant trip and one that 
will live long in the memory of the par¬ 
ticipants. Mr. and Mrs. Edmonds 
also entertained at luncheon Sunday 
evening, July the 14th, Rev. J. D. Diggs 
of Winston, N. C., Thos. H. B. Walker 
of Jacksonville, Fla., and G. W. Cooper 
of Burnettsville, S. C. After visiting- 
some of the neighboring orange groves 
they returned to the city well pleased 
with their trip.

A HAPPY MARRIAGE. 

Suspends the Publication of a News¬ 
paper. 

Mr. P. S. Dayton, the well-known 
editor of the Los Angeles Business Re¬ 
view and also editor and publisher of 
the West End News was happily mar¬ 
ried some time ago, and since- that 
happy event his services at home have 
been so constancy required that he 
found it urgently necessary to suspend 
the publication of the News for the 
time being. The Business Review how¬ 
ever, comes out regularly and like its 
editor looks brighter in every line. The 
failure of the News to make its appear¬ 
ance caused wide-spread disappoint¬ 
ment and gloomy forbodings among its 
readers over in Pico Heights, but when 
the cause of its suspension reached that 
beautiful suburb, the good news was 
passed from house to house and the 
temporary unrest was turned to joy. 
To see editor Dayton as he swings 
down Broadway now-a-days with the 
air of a man no longer threatened by 
the wolf is the i.nvy of a hoard of strug¬ 
gling newspaper editors who are fre¬ 
quently seen rushing along that popu¬ 
lar highway. Mr. Dayton has always 
been a believer in the business ex¬ 
pansion, and his many friends are now 
expecting to see some real expansion in 
h.s family affairs. Now that one whoie 
moon, popularly knokn as “ The 
Honey,” has pass, d,and another is near 
ing the meridean of its life, the people 
over in the Heights are anxious to 
have some sort of “News” from Dayton. 


REV. J. E. EDWARDS. 

Rev. J. E. Edwards will leave this 
city for New York on the 17th of this 
month, and will leave there for London 
September the 24th. He goes as dele¬ 
gate to the eccumenicai conference. 
Rev. Edwards is a Christian gentleman 
of fine intellectual attainments and 
will fittingly represent the church in 
that great body of Christian workers. 
He will carry with him the best wishes 
cf our entire population. His life and 
character has been helpful to all who 
tame in contact with him .

Unjust Criticism. 


Rev. Chandler Replies. 


The Liberator Raises the Siege. 


Under the above caption in the Ex¬ 
press of July 25th, Rev Chandler sus¬ 
tains the contention of “The Liberator” 
that “White and colored children are 
treated alike in the public schools,” as 
the following extracts from his commu¬ 
nication shows 

“I have only words of praise for 
the very excellent and impartial man¬ 
agement of our public schools, and do 
not desire to have any color line 
drawn. The time may soon come 
when there shall be appointed colored 
teachers in the schools. What the 
true American opposes, is not dark¬ 
ness of skin, but darkness of ignor¬ 
ance. 

* * * 

“I wish to be understood. The fault 
was found with a private school. 

* * * 

“And why should I be belied be¬ 
cause I spoke the truth in saying ‘that 
the colored people are discriminated 
against in many cases, although we 
have equal rights as far as the public 
schools are concerned?” 

“Because of the fact that not even 
a few of our youths are prepared to take 
a college course, and many are too old 
to begin the com:mon branches in the 
public* schools, I believe I am right in 
advocating that a night school, where 
the special needs peculiar to many of 
my people comes of a lack of training 
for which they are not to blame, would 
be beneficial in the truest sense, and 
would prove to be one of the mightiest 
agents in bettering the morals of our 
community.” 

Now if what the reverend gentleman 
says istrue , as regards the public 
schools, which include the high and 
normal schools, and also Berkeley, 
which is the state university, we hard¬ 
ly know what he is driving at. And 
further, if the doors of all of the in¬ 
stitutions named are free to colored 
children, why are they clamoring to 
enter private schools? If they are 


forced to “quit” the public school to go 
to work, how would they pay their 
tuition in private schools? There is a 
free night school on Spring street open 
to all, old and young. Why don’t they 
attend it? Mr. Frey, a colored black¬ 
smith 65 years old, is attending this 
school. 

“Many of our race speak of the ad¬ 
vantages offered us by the Y. M. C. A. 
and also the Y. W. C. A. Although 
the managers of these associations feel 
in entire sympathy with the colored 
people, they confess there is an inevit¬ 
able constraint that the colored people 
do not feel at home and will not at¬ 
tend.” 

Our young people must give up the 
idea of going to institutions of learn¬ 
ing to feel at home, but rather to learn. 
In the truest sense, they are not home, 
but mainly places where the youths are 
fitted to make homes. Some two years 
ago Rev. Edwards organized a brother¬ 
hood on the same basis as that of the 
Y. M. C. A., but the young people didn’t 
“feel at home, and the attendance has 
usually been small, although the pro¬ 
grams were always excellent. Now we 
had no intention whatever to misrep- 
sent or “belie” Rev. Chandler, but 
merely stated facts, and believe that 
those who have read both sides of this 
controversy will bear out the state¬ 
ment. 

•-o-- 

MR. WILLIAM W. GLENN. 

The petition presented to the police 
commission signed by a large number 
of our prominent colored citizens is 
a move in the right direction. In view 
of the fact that there will soon be 12 
or 15 new policemen appointed, the col¬ 
ored citizens will certainly be entitled 
to one of them. Mr. Glenn is an intel¬ 
ligent young man of good moral char¬ 
acter and we believe he will make a 
good officer. We trust he will be suc¬ 
cessful. 


A CREDIT TO THE RACE. 

“The Liberator,” a monthly publica¬ 
tion edited by our old friend, J. L. Ed¬ 
munds, of Los Angeles, is one of the 
brightest publications that makes its 
way to our desk. It is a credit to the 
race as well as to its editor.—Pacific 
Coast Appeal. 


VENICE. 

Written for the “Liberator.” 

No more the Doge’s footstep falls 
Within the stately palace walls 
Thy marble piles rise from the sea 
Like dreams of immortality. 

The sunset breezes softly sigh 
Beneath a sweet, clear summer sky 
The deep blue waters ebb and flow 
And glorious is thy twilight glow. 

A scene of beauty—dream of love 
Reflected from the shores above 
Thy Winged Lion proudly stands 
Sculptured by magician’s hand 

St. Mark’s columns grandly rise 
Near-by the mystic Bridge of Sighs, 

In thy enchanted atmosphere 
Echoes the song of the gondolier. 

But over each and over all 
Is spread a shroud—a sable 1 pall 
Thy prestige gone forever more. 

Thy palaces fall to the shore. 

Bride of the Adriatic sea 
Now widowed for eternity 
Thy bridal robes are faded now 
And death is shadowed on thy brow. 

Thy merchant fleet its sails have furled 
No more brings tribute from a world 
No more will sail o’er waters wide 
No more be tossed by winds and tide 

Thy banquet halls no more will be 
Scenes of mirth and revelry 
Their wine and music all are gone 
Down into nighty oblivion 

f 

Thy palaces by waves' carreBsed 
Are crumbling on the water’s breast 
Thy glory now is on the wing 
Thy solemn dirge the billows sing 

The winds moan sadly o’er the sea 
A requiem for thine and thee 
Pathetic music—funeral knell 
Murmuring “Farewell, Farewell.”

THE POLITICAL POT BOILS. 

Although the time for holding con¬ 
ventions to nominate candidates for 
state offices is a year hence the polit¬ 
ical pot is already boiling. The fight 
for the gubernatorial nomination in 
the republican state convention prom¬ 
ises to be the hardest in the history of 
such conventions, “to a man up a tree" 
it looks a little gloomy for Governor 
Gage, but he is on the ground floor and 
is an astute politician. Los Angeles 
county is almost certain to send a di¬ 
vided delegation t 0 Sacramento. The 
line between the railroad and the anti¬ 
railroad elements of the party will be 
closely drawn and regardless of the re¬ 
sult of the convention the contest will 
be carried to the polls, Hon. M. P. 
Snyder, the popular mayor of this city 
is prominently mentioned in connec¬ 
tion with the democratic nomination 


for governor. He has a fighting chance 
and if nominated the result of the 
gubernatorial contest will be in doubt.

MAJOR J. A. DONNELL. 

The friends of Major Donnell, the 
popular ex-District Attorney, are quiet¬ 
ly trying to get him to enter the race 
for Senator from Pasadena senatorial 
district. The major has a big law prac¬ 
tice and as far as we can learn, has not 
consented as yet to allow the use of his 
name in this connection. He is an 
able lawyer, a brilliant entertaining or¬ 
ator and has few equals in the state. 
Mr. B. W. Hann, a prominent and 
premising young lawyer of Pasadena it 
is understood, would like to represent 
the district in the senate hut the 
major’s friends claim that with his con¬ 
sent to the use of his name victory in 
the senatorial convention and at the 
polls will be comparatively easy.

REV. F. L. DONOHOO. 

The successful manner in which the 
Epworth League delegates were enter¬ 
tained, brings Rev. Donohoo again 
prominently before those interested in 
the progress of the Afro-Americans. He 
is undoubtedly one of the most tireless 
workers among the Afro-Americans in 
this city. Under his pastorate the 
growth of the Wesley chapel of 
the M. E. Church has been phenome¬ 
nal. Since paying off an indebtedness 
of $800, he added 550 volumes to the 
church library, purchased a $370 pipe 
organ and expended $178 on internal 
improvements of the church. During 
the last quarter 26members heve been 
received and the work of uplifting has 
gone steadily on. Flattering as the 
above figures may appear they are in- 
siginficant when compared to the work 
he is doing for the moral and intellect¬ 
ual upbuilding of the community over 
which he presides as pastor. Instead 
of proselyting, he sought for those 
outside of the church who needed to 
come under its influence. By honesty 
of purpose he has the aid of the entire 
community in anything he wishes to 
accomplish. 


Mr. A. M. Keihl, manager of the Pas¬ 
adena Department Store, is giving a 
reduction of ten per cent on all goods 
purchased at his place till August 22d. 
So great has been the increase in his 
business that he is now enlarging 
space so as to carry a stock equal to 
his demands. On September 1st he will 
occupy the space now being fitted up 
and will carry a stock double its former 
size. After September 1st he will carry 
a full line of men’s and boys’ clothing, 
hats and shoes, a full line of ladies’ 
furnishing goods, capes and patterns. 
The ten per cent reduction given the 
patrons of this store is drawing large 
crowds, who are taking advantage of 
a real expansion sale. It will pay you 
to call. 29 and 31 North Fair Oaks ave¬

A PLEASANT RECEPTION. 

The cozy home of Mr. and Mrs. C. 
W. Holden on Edwin street was the 
scene of a very pleasant reception on 
the evening of July 15th. Among those 
present were Revs. J. D. Diggs of 
Winston, N. C., G. W. Cooper of Ben- 
nettsville, S. C. A gentleman from 
Texas, whose name we cannot recall, 
the editor of the Liberator, Mr. and 
Mrs. Holden and two daughters, Misses 
Lula J. and Gertrude, Mr. Thos, H. B. 
Walker of Florida, and a number of 
others had been invited, but they had 
gone on excursions around the city and 
did not arrive in time. Much of the 
time during the evening was spent ex¬ 
amining the fine collection of .drawing 
and oil painting, the work of Miss Lula, 
who graduated from the Los Angeles 
Art School with highest honors in the 
class of ’99. Her paintings are highly 
appreciated and are finding places in 
the homes of some of our best people. 
Mr. Holden is a prosperous rancher 
and is making money in the hog bus - 
ness. He has a valuable, well kept 
ranch. Everything about it bears the 
marks of industry and constant care. 

-:—o- 

The Afro-American congress will 
c nvene here next week. There seems 
lo be little or no preparation for its en¬ 
tertainment. It is understood that the 
old fight between the northern leaders 
is to he renewed.

Chamber of Commerce 

The Scene of a Briliant 
Banquet. 


People of all Colors Join in Splendid 
Repast. 

The reception tendered the visiting 
Epworth League delegates at the 
Chamber of Commerce on July 14 was 
one of the most notable events of the 
kind ever witnessed at that museum 
of western push and enterprise. The 
presence in the city of that delegation 
composed as it was of distinguished 
Christian workers and leaders both 
white and colored, from north, east and 
south was a rare treat to our leaguers 
and citizens. The doors were thrown 
open at an early hour and every inch 
of standing space was occupied. 

A continual stream of people poured in 
taking a look at the brilliant throng, 
then good naturedly passed out noise¬ 
lessly, thus preventing the overcrowd¬ 
ing of the building. Inside the walls of 
that spacious building tastefully ar¬ 
ranged are the products of the farms, 
orchards and mines of Southern 
California. On every hand the 
beautiful works of art contend for 
a closer resemblance to the works 
of nature. Look where you will 
and the scene pays tribute to the gen¬ 
ius and enterprise of our sterling busi¬ 
ness men. The visitors seemed to 
thoroughly enjoy themselves and no 
exhibit was overlooked. The addresses 
of the local and visiting talent was 
happy and appropriate. 

At the conclusion of the program all 
partook of lemonade and cookies which 
were served in the reception room. To 
see the white and colored delegates 
from the south, that section where the 
races are so friendly that they have 
to have separate cars and waiting 
rooms drinking lemonade from the 
same fountain and partaking of sweet 
things from the same platters was a 
sight that would have attracted the at¬ 
tention of the Gods. Either their re- 
ligiousfeelings for the time being tri¬ 
umphed over their eccentricities or 
the succumb to the softening influence 
of our western civilization. 


A Great Gathering. 

The Reception at Elks’ Hall a 
Brilliant Success. 

The reception at Elks’ hall was the 
grandest and most enjoyable one ever 
tendered a colored delegation in this 
city. It was given under the auspices 
of the Epworth League of the Wesley 
Chapel, Methodist Episcopal Church, 
with the aid of the colored 
churches of the city. Its grand 
success was largely due t-o the untiring 
labor of Rev. F. L. Donohoo and to 
efficient assistants among whom were 
Messrs. J. A. Jackson, C. W. Holden, 
McRea, W. F. Henderson, A. S. Eagle, 
T. M .McClellan and others. The re¬ 
ception committee was composed of 
representative men and women of the 
city and surrounding towns and an in¬ 
terest was aroused that made success a 
certainty. Elks’ hall one of the larg¬ 
est in the city was filled with the 
wealth and intelligence, the grace and 
beauty of the city and suburbs. 

In the audience were many white 
people who seemed to enjoy the music 
and speeches. 

The program though rather long, was 
a splendid one and was applauded by 
the audience. Among the inspiring 
addresses delivered, those by Dr. Scott, 
editor of the Southwestern Christian 
Advocate, Rev. Carter, secretary of the 
Epworth League of the C. M. E. Church 
and I. Garland Penn, assistant general 
secretary of the Epworth Leagues of 
the M. E. Church were very noteworthy 
ard made a deep impression on the au¬ 
dience. There were other speeches 
that ought to be mentioned but space 
will not permit. 

Revs.Donohoo and A.D. Chandler de¬ 
livered short and appropriate addresses 
after, which supper was served to the 
entire audience by Hicks, the popular 
caterer, which was thoroughly enjoyed. 

The gentlemen and ladies composing 
the delegation were a credit not only 
to the race but to the states from which 
they came. A more intelligent, digni¬ 
fied company of Chrristian workers 
never visited this city. Their visits 
served to arouse our people to live 
and labor for higher things. 


Their culture and dignified bearing 
attracted the attention and won for 
them the respect of the people wher¬ 
ever they appeared. 

They were the bearers of good news 
and glad tidings from our brethren in 
the Atlantic and Gulf states whom they 
say are educating their children, buy¬ 
ing homes, engaging in business and 
training themselves in those things 
that make honorable and useful cit¬ 
izens. 

They made stronger our conviction 
that the success of the colored people of 
this country depends upon those in the 
south. They are surrounded by the 
elements that force into action the 
best qualities of a people. 

Their visit was a source of much 
pleasure to we Californians, a meet¬ 
ing of long separated friends, and unex¬ 
pected family reunion. 

It would indeed be pleasant to give to 
the readers of the Liberator an extend¬ 
ed personnel of the delegation, but our 
space is limited. Dr. Scott, the orator 
and editor of the Southwestern Christ¬ 
ian Advocate, Rev. R. A. Carter, of At¬ 
lanta, Ga., the brilliant orator and 
gifted word painter, secretary of the 
Epworth Leagues of the C.M.E. Church 
and Professor I. Garland Penn, author 
of the Afro-American Press and its ed¬ 
itors, Asssistant General Secretary of 
the Epworth League, is an elo¬ 
quent orator, a deep thinker and able 
writer. Rev. J. D. Diggs, pastor of the 
Methodist Episcopal Chapel at Wins¬ 
ton, N. C., is a teacher and a scholar 
of wide reading and practical ideas, a 
gentleman of lofty ambition eager to 
do a man’s part in the struggle for the 
elevation of man. 

* * * 

Rev. Thomas H. B. Walker, editor 
of Banner and Review, of Jacksonville, 
Fla., and state secretary of the Ep¬ 
worth league, is also very prom¬ 
inent in the fraternal socitties of the 
south and is a Grand Chancellor of the 
K. of P.’s. He is director in several 
commercial enterprises in Florida and 

other southern states in its fullest 

sense.

of the army of earnest workers who 
are doing so much to better the morals, 
spiritual intellectual and financial con¬ 
ditions of the Afro-Americans in the 
South. And like his companions made 
a favorable impression on all who met 
him. 

We parted with him and the dele¬ 
gation with the feeling that we would 
hear from them again. 

Mr. Singleton, of Richmond, Va., an 
employe in the customs house of that 
city is a young man of ability and is 
very enthusiastic regarding the future 
of the race. In spite of the difficulties 
which the race has to contend with he 
says the movement is onward and up¬ 
ward. 

* * * 

Rev. F. T. Chinn, of New Orleans, 
pastor of the First Methodist Church 
in that city; W. S. Chinn, state presi¬ 
dent of the Epworth League for Louis- 
ana; Prof. McDonald, of Austin, Tex; 
Revs. D. P. Parlard, L, P. Piles, and 
S. J. Morrison, of Ladonia, Tex.; Revs. 
A. B. Lennox, of Detroit, Tex, Free¬ 
man Parker, of Paris, Tex., Miss H. H. 
Reason, school teacher at Washington, 
D. C., Mrs. Annie S. Gray, principal of 
the Greenwood graded colored school 
of Greenwood, Miss., and Miss Sara A. 
Page, teacher in the city school at 
Canton, Miss., were among the delega¬ 
tion. 

There were also many other distin¬ 
guished persons in the delegation 
whose names we could not obtain. We 
wish them Godspeed in their noble call¬ 
ing. Indeed we will hear from them 
again, we will hear from the work that 
is being done by that great army of 
noble workers of whom they are wor¬ 
thy representatives. The lives they are 
living will tell for time and eternity.
