THE PRESIDENT AT 
TUSKEGEE 

His Speech an Inspiration to 
all Afro-Americans 

America’s Greatest Presi¬ 
dent Preaching the Gospel 
of “A Square Deal” to 
the South 

By the Associated Press. 

Tuskegee, Ala., Oct. 24.—The Presi¬ 
dent arrived in Tuskegee at 8:30 o’clock 
this morning, his train being on time. 
The city was beautifully decorated. A 
number of arches , the foundations of 
which were made of bales of cotton, 
had been erected and covered with 
bunting. The platform from which the 
President spoke to the people of the 
city was made from $30,000 worth of 
cotton in original bales. The Presi¬ 
dent’s address was short, and at its con¬ 
clusion he left for the Tuskegee Normal 
and Industrial School. 

Here, after the parade had passed 
and the students, faculty and visitors 
were repairing to the chapel, the Presi¬ 
dential party was driven hurriedly 
aboyt the grounds, and was shown the 
extent and scope of work being car¬ 
ried on by the institution. Then to 
the chapel the party was taken, where 
the students, led by the institute choir 
of 150 voices, sang a number of planta¬ 
tion melodies. Booker T. Washington 
then presented the President in the fol¬ 
lowing words: 

“This is a great day for the Tuske¬ 
gee Normal and Industrial Institute; 
too great to be described by words. We 
have gathered to hear but one voice; 
to see but one face. 

“In presenting our guest to the stu¬ 
dents, teachers and citizens, I must not 
omit to express the gratitude felt by 
the people of Tuskegee Institute and 
by the people of both races in this sec¬ 
tion of Alabama for the honor which 
has been conferred upon them. That 
the Chief Magistrate of our beloved 
republic of 80,000,000 people deemed it 
good and wise to include Tuskegee In¬ 
stitute in his trip through the South 
and spend a few hours seeing the work 
we are doing here brings to the heart 
of every man and woman of our race 
in this country a degree v of encourage¬ 
ment and inspiration which it is im¬ 
possible for any American citizen not 
of our race fully to appreciate. 

“My friends, without further words 
of mine, I have the pleasure and the 
honor of presenting to you the Presi¬ 
dent of the United States, Hon. Theo¬ 
dore Roosevelt.” 

The President was given an ovation 
as he rose to speak. Pie said: 


OPPORTUNITY OF THE NEGRO 

To the white population, as well as to 
the black, it is of the utmost importance 
that the negro be encouraged to make 
himself a citizen of the highest type 
of usefulness. It is to the interest of 
the white people that this policy be 
conscientiously pursued, and to the in¬ 
terest of the colored people that they 
clearly realize that they have opportun¬ 
ity for economic development here in 
the South, not now offered elsewhere. 

Within the last twenty years, the in¬ 
dustrial operations of the South have 
increased so tremendously that there is 
a scarcity of labor almost everywhere, 
so that it is the part of wisdom for all 
who wish the prosperity of the South 
to help the negro to become in the 
highest degree useful to himself, and 
therefore to the community in which he 
lives. 

The South has always depended, and 
now depends, chiefly upon her native 
population for her work. Therefore, in 
view of the scarcity not only of com¬ 
mon labor, but of skilled labor, it be¬ 
comes doubly important to train every 
available man to be of the utmost use 
by developing his intelligence, his skill 
and his capacity for conscientious ef¬ 
fort. Hence the work of the Tuskegee 
Normal and Industrial Institute is a 
matter of the highest practical im¬ 
portance to both the white man and 
the black man, and well worth the sup¬ 
port of both races alike in the South 
and in the North. 

Your 1500 students are not only being 
educated in head and heart, but also 
trained to industrial efficiency, for from 
the beginning Tuskegee has placed 
especial emphasis upon the training of 
men and women in agriculture, me¬ 
chanics and household duties. Train¬ 
ing in these three fundamental direc¬ 
tions does not embrace all that the 
negro or any other race needs, but it 
does cover in a very large degree the 
field in which the negro can at present 
do most for himself and be most help¬ 
ful to his white neighbors. Every 
black man who l^ves this institution 
is better able to do mechanical or in¬ 
dustrial work; adds by so much to the 
wealth of the whole community, and 
benefits all people in the community. 
The professional and mercantile ave¬ 
nues to success are overcrowded; for 
the present, the best chance of success 
awaits the intelligent worker at some 
mechanical trade, or on a farm; for 
this man will almost certainly achieve 
industrial independence. 

I am pleased, but not the least sur¬ 
prised, to Ic-p.rn that many among the 
women and men trained at Tuskegee 
find immediate employment as leaders 
and workers among their own people, 
and that their services are generally 
sought by white people for various 
kinds of industrial work, the demand 
being much greater than the supply. 
EDUCATION COUNTS. 

Viewed from any angle, ignorance is 
the costliest crop that can be raised 


in any part of this Union. Every dol¬ 
lar put into the education of either 
white man or black man, in head, in 
hands and in heart, yields rich divi¬ 
dends to the entire community. Merely 
from the economic standpoint, it is of 
the utmost consequence to all our citi¬ 
zens that institutions, such as this at 
Tuskegee, should be a success. But 
there are other and even higher rea¬ 
sons that entitle it to our support. In 
the interest of humanity, of justice and 
of self-protection, every white man in 
America, no matter where he lives, 
should try to help the negro to help 
himself. It is in the interest and for 
the protection of the white man to see 
that the negro is educated. 

It is not only the duty of the white 
man, but it is to his interest to see 
that the negro is protected in property, 
in life and in all his legal rights. Ev¬ 
ery time a law is broken every indi¬ 
vidual in the community has the moral 
tone of his life lowered. Lawlessness 
in the United States is not confined to 
any one section; lynching is not con¬ 
fined to any one section, and there is 
perhaps no body of American citizens 
who have deserved so well of the en¬ 
tire American people as the public 
men, publicists, the clergymen, the 
countless thousands of high-minded 
private citizens who have done such 
heroic work in the South in arousing 
public opinion against lawlessness in 
all its forms, and especially against 
lynching. I very ernestly hope that 
their example will count in the North, 
as well as in the South, for there are 
just as great evils to be warred against 
in one region of our country as in an¬ 
other, though they are not in all places 
the same evils. 

These men not merely serve a use¬ 
ful purpose in directing the particular 
task to which they set themselves, but 
deserve a lift to the cause of good citi¬ 
zenship throughout the Union. I heart¬ 
ily appreciate what you have done at 
Tuskegee, and I am sure you will not 
grudge my saying that it could not 
possibly have been done save for the 
loyal support you have received from 
the white people round about; for dur¬ 
ing the twenty-five years of effort to 
educate the black man here in the 
midst of a white community of intel¬ 
ligence and culture, there has never 
been an outbreak between the races, 
or any difficulty of any kind. All 
honor is due to the white men of Ala¬ 
bama, to the white men of Tuskegee 
for what they have done. 

THE RIGHT PATH. 

And right here let me say that if any 
community misunderstanding between 
the races arises over any matter, infin¬ 
itely the best way out is to have a 
prompt, frank and full conference and 
consultation between representatives 
of the wise, cool-headed men among 
the whites, and the wise, decent, cool- 
headed colored men. Such a confer¬ 
ence will always tend to bring about 
i better understanding and will be a 
























s

great help all around. , 

Hitherto, I have spoken chiefly to 
the obligations existing on the present 
white man. Now, let you remember, 
on the other hand, that no help can 
permanently avail you save as you 
yourselves develop for self-help. You 
young colored 1 men and women, edu¬ 
cated at Tuskegee, must, by precept and 
example, lead your fellows toward so¬ 
ber, industrious, law-abiding lives. You 
are in honor bound to join hands in 
enforcing the laws and to war against 
all crimes, and especially against crime 
by men of your own race, for the heav¬ 
iest wrong done by the criminal is the 
wrong to his own race. You must 
teach the people of your race that they 
must scrupulously observe any . contract 
into which they in good faith enter, no 
matter whether it is hard to keep or 
not. If you save money, secure homes 
and lead clean, decent, modest lives, you 
will win the respect of your neighbors 
of both races. Let each man strive to 
excel his fellows only by rendering 
substantia] service to the community in 
which he lives. The people have many 
difficulties to pass through, but these 
difficulties will be surmounted, if only 
the policy of reason and common sense 
is pursued. 

REAL AND GREATPROGRESS. 

You have made real and great pro¬ 
gress. According to the census, the 
colored people of this country own and 
pay taxes on something like $300,000,000 
worth of property, and have blotted 
out over 50 per cent of the illiteracy. 
What you have done in the past is an 
indication of what you will be able to 
accomplish in the future under wise 
leadership. Moral and industrial edu¬ 
cation. is what is most needed, in order 
that this progress may continue. The 
race cannot expect to do everything at 
once. It must learn to wait and bide 
its time; to prove itself worthy by 
showing its possession of persever¬ 
ance, of thrift, of self-control. The 
destiny of the race is chiefly in its own 
hands, and must be worked out pa¬ 
tiently and persistently along these 
lines. 

Remember, also, that the white man 
who can be of most use to the colored 
man is that colored man’s neighbor. It 
is the Southern people themselves who 
must and can solve the difficulties that 
exist in the South. Of course, what 
help the people of the rest of the union 
can give them, must and will be gladly 
r*nd cheerfully given. The hope of ad¬ 
vancement for the colored man in the 
South lies in his steady, common-sense 
effort to improve his moral and ma¬ 
terial condition, and to work in har¬ 
mony with the white man in the up¬ 
building of the commonwealth. 

Hie future of the South now depends 
upon the people of both races to living 
up to this principle and letter of the 
laws of their several States and work¬ 
ing out the destinies of both races, not 
as races, but as law-abiding American 
citizens. 


The Board of Education of the M. E. 
Church, South, comes out for higher 
education for the negros 
We recognize the need of the race 
for its own preachers, teachers and lit¬ 
erary men, as well as for its own pub¬ 
lic servants in the various professions. 
While we admit the great value of in¬ 
dustrial training for the negro, we at 
the same time believe that the higher 
college and university training is of 
still greater value in the present state 
of his development, because his advance" 
ment can not be secured without com¬ 
petent leadership from his own midst. 
He must develop self-respect. As long 
as he considers himself inferior to 
others, socially and morally, it will be 
impossible for him to advance in civili¬ 
zation. He must have and respect his 
own institutions, especially those of 
the family and the church. In 1900 the 
total number of negro college graduates 
was about 2,500. Fifty-three per cent 
of these were teachers; seventeen per 
cent in the various professions, mostly 
the medical; six per cent, merchants, 
farmers and artisans, and four per cent 
in the civil service. The testimony of 
one of their own members is that “they 
have usually been conservative and 
careful leaders, seldom agitators, and 
that they have worked steadily and 
faithfully in a thousand communities in 
the South. But one college trained man 
to every 2,800 members of the race is 
a most inadequate supply, especially 
when we consider that by no means all 
of these were trained under religious 
influences, and that perhaps fully as 
large a per cent of them as of white 
graduates fail to appreciate the obliga¬ 
tions under which their advantages have 
placed them.”—Christion Index. 


NEGROES WILL TEST TENNES¬ 
SEE STREET JIM CROW LAW. 

The negroes of Memphis. Tenn., have 
employed Hon. J'. T. Settles of Mem¬ 
phis, Tenn., to bring suit against the 
street car company for violation of the 
constitutional amendments of the Unit¬ 
ed States. Hon. Settles is one of the 
leading negro lawyers, not only in Ten¬ 
nessee, hut of the South. He is highly 
respected by the white bar for his great 
legal ability. He will lead the fight 
against the company. For several 
months the negroes have met to formu¬ 
late some definite plan ot action. It is 
said that $5,000 have been secured to 
prosecute the case. We commend the 
efforts put forth to overthrow a law 
which was conceived in sin and born 
in iniquity. We do not see how such 
could meet the disapproval of any man 
or woman who has negro blood cours¬ 
ing through his veins. The law has 
been pronounced by many as class leg¬ 
islation, and in violation of the Four¬ 
teenth Amendment of the Constitution 
of the United States and the state of 
Tennessee. It is similar to the Florida 
law which has been declared unconsti¬ 
tutional by the circuit court and the 
supreme judiciary of the state. It di¬ 


vides the negro race into classes, by 
giving some of them certain privileges 
denied to others. It is apparent that 
it draws two color lines, one between 
the negro and the negro, and the other 
between the negro and the whites. 

Mrs, Mary Morrison, a negro woman, 
refused to change her seat when re¬ 
quested by the conductor, and therefore 
she was arrested. She was fined $10.00, 
but refused to pay it and took an appeal 
to the criminal court. The attorney for 
the street car company wanted the case 
quashed, but this contention was over¬ 
ruled. The case will be vigorously 
prosecuted in the criminal and supreme 
court of Tennesee, and if necessary, 
will go to the United States supreme 
court. If Florida’s learned judiciary 
has declared the Jim Crow street car 
law of that state unconstitutional, and 
the Tennessee law is “Sui generis ” we 
hardly see but what the latter will meet 
similar fate. Below is the contention 
of Mr. Settle for the great law suit: 

“First—Section two (2) of said street 
car act is vague and uncertain. 

“Second—Said act is in violation of 
the 14th amendment of the Constitution 
of the United States of America, in that 
it denies to a certain class of colored 
citizens an equal protection of the law. 

“Third—Because section seven (7) 
of the act not only gives to certain por¬ 
tions of colored people, to-wit, colored 
nurses having the care of white chil¬ 
dren, and colored servants in charge of 
sick white people, rights and immunities 
denied to other colored people, contrary 
to the fourteenth amendment of the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America, but also renders said law spe¬ 
cial and not general, contrary to section 
twenty (20), article three (3), of the 
Constitution of the State of Tennessee. 

“Fourth—Said law is in violation of 
section two (2) of the 14th amendment 
of the Constitution of the United States 
of America, which denies any state the 
right to pass any law abridging the 
rights and .privileges of citizens of the 
United States. 

“Fifth—Said law gives to one class 
of citizens, to-wit, white citizens, cer¬ 
tain rights, privileges and immunities 
not granted thereby to colored citizens. 

“Seventh—That the law undertakes 
to create officers not known to the Con¬ 
stitution of Tennessee, and empowers 
street railway companies to make the 
appointment of same, and not requiring 
said officers to take oath for the faith¬ 
ful performance of duty as required by 
law.”—Christian Index.

THE PRESIDENT AT TUSKEGEE. 

The President’s speech delivered to 
the Tuskegee students was characteris¬ 
tic of the man of the "square deal” Ev¬ 
ery issue was squarely met. There was 
no trimming to suit the section in 
which it was delivered. There is no¬ 
thing of the politician or demagogue in 
the President’s makeup. His reply to 
Gov. Jeff Davis of Arkansas on the 
lynching evil caps the climax of all of 
his broadsides against that infamous 
species of lawlessness. He said: 

“Now, to avenge one hideous crime 
by another is -to reduce the avenger 
to the beastial level. Another thing 
which makes this lynch law abhorrent 
is that three-fourths of the crimes 
for which it is invoked are for others 
than that against the woman of the 
country. Governor, you and I and all 
others in authority owe it to our peo¬ 
ple to drive out the reproach and men¬ 
ace of lynch law in the United States.” 


That has been our position all along. 
A brute commits crime and is burned at 
the stake, the fiends that burn him and 
those who witness it, are in every way 
as low and as beastial and as brutal and 
as dangerous to society as their victim, 
no matter whether they are white or 


black. How any sane, virtuous man or 
woman can see it in any other light it 
is difficult to understand. 

The President gave Davis and his 
kind a knock out blow right in their 
own ring. Roosevelt is a great states¬ 
man, a greater humanitarian, America’s 
greatest president and stands before the 
world head and shoulders above any 
man of his day and generation. 


A TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 

There is urgent need of an associa¬ 
tion composed of the colored Sunday 
School teachers of this city in order 
that by mutual discussion and exchange 
of ideas they may become better fitted 
for the great wo.k they have in hand. 
The number of our Sunday School 
graduates both boys and girls who go 
to the streets and dives is distressingly 
large. Unless something is done it 
will not be long before the paths of sin 
and crime will gather a greater harves*. 
than the church. How to save the boys 
and grils to the church and society is a 
problem that demands a solution now. 
And the part the Sunday School teach¬ 
ers can play in its solution is inestim¬ 
able. We do not offer this as a panacea 
for all the ills that afflict our youths in 
the city; the teachers cannot do every¬ 
thing, but by working unitedly they can 
do more than is being done now. 

If our young people are to be made 
desirable citizens a great deal of hard, 
earnest work will have to be done 
among them. Their moral stand¬ 
ard will have to be raised; it is too 
low now. There are growing up among 
us too many rough, ill-mannered, loud¬ 
mouthed boys and girls. 

There are too many who believe that 
fine clothes makes men and women; as 
a result large numbers of fifteen-year- 
old boys and guIs quit school to earn 
money to buy clothes to parade the 
streets and attend social functions. 
There are too many entertainments and 
concerts keeping the young people out 
at night exposing them needlessly to 
temptation. They don’t sleep enough. 
They have no time to read and study. 
Too many bright boys are being sacri¬ 
ficed upon boot-black stands. The boy 
who enters the boot-black stand prac¬ 
tically closes forever the church be¬ 
hind him. That these things are true 
is due mainly to a lack of proper home 


training. This fact alone makes a 
teachers’ association doubly necessary 
in order that these homes may be 
reached. Our boys and girls like other 
boys and girls, are all right. All they 
need is to be properly trained. As 
teachers you are making or unmaking 
men and women. The work you are 
doing will count for good or evil for 
time and eternity. We owe it to our 
children and to society to see that they 
begin life’s journey on the right road. 

Shall we have an association? 

Let us hear from the teachers and 
preache: s. 

Chaplain Allensworth has been elect¬ 
ed president of the defunct Forum. It 
is a good selection for it will require 
a man of great faith and a wealth of 
praying material to resurrect its depart¬ 
ed glory. It is like fastening the body 
of a living man to that of a dead one, 
in the vain hope of resurrecting it. 
There was a time when the Forum was 
the gathering place of the business and 
professional men and others interested 
in the welfare of the race and their 
plans for race advancement were pub¬ 
lished in the daily papers. Then came 
the pin-headed negro whose only ob¬ 
ject of existence is to, as far as it lies 
in his power, prevent any negro from 
doing something. He is afraid that 
some negro will do something that will 
make him big. Well, to make a long 
story short, the Forum began to flirt 
with the Afro-American council and 
the influences that has made that or¬ 
ganization a stench in the nostrils of 
decent people, drove this class out of 
the Forum., 

The Afro-American State Council, so 
called, is in a bad way. It has neither 
charter, attorney nor treasurer. The 
beast can’t raise money enough to buy 
a charter, which is probably five or ten 
dollars. Its attorney resigned, giving 
as his reason that the position was a 
reflection not only upon his moral char¬ 
acter but upon his legal ability. The 
council’s state treasurer stole an old 
stocking and twelve dollars from a poor 
old colored widow woman, and al¬ 
though his friends promptly satisfied the 
state's demands by paying into its treas¬ 
ury twenty-five dollars, he is a fugitive 
—a fugitive from a guilty conscience. 

With a hangdog look the other of¬ 
ficers always manage to pass you on 
the other side of the street.

THE NEGRO AND THE SAN 
FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL MUD¬ 
DLE. 

In the struggle now being waged so 
fiercely between the union labor party, 
headed by Mayor Schmitz and Mr. Part¬ 
ridge, backed by the Republican and 
Democratic parties, the negro is “be¬ 
tween the devil and the deep blue sea.” 
Discussing the situation recently, a San 
Francisco colored minister, one of the 
most distinguished in the state, said: 
‘T don't know what to do. I have al¬ 
ways advised our people to vote the Re¬ 
publican ticket, but since this fusion be¬ 
tween the Republicans and Democrats, 
I do not know how to advise them, 
it seems that both Republicans and 
Democrats are against the negro—after 
the electio nanyway.” 

Our brethren in the Golden Gate 
city are in the position of the fellow 
in the bear fight: Having knocked out 
all the knights of the ring in his vicinity, 
he insisted that he could whip a bear if 
one could be found. To give him a 
chance to make good his claim, a neigh¬ 
bor who knew the hiding place of an old 
she bear, took him to the place. A 
small dog was sent into the brush and 
soon came out hotly puisiud by Bruin. 
Like a flash the hair-brained fellow flew 
at her. In less time than it takes to 
tell it, he discovered that the dangerous 
part of a bear is just opposite to that 
of a mule and so made a successful dash 
for her tail, which he seized. In her 
frenzied efforts to catch him, the old 
bear ran round and round, swinging the 
fellow clear off the ground. In the midst 
of that whirl of excitement, the neigh¬ 
bor who was witnessing the fight from 
a safe distance, cried out, “Hold ’er! 
hold ’er!" But the fellow who was do¬ 
ing the tail stunt cried, “Come and help 
me tu. n ’er loose.” “If you want to 
turn ’er loose, just let go her tail,” was 
the quick response.” “If I let go her 
tail, it is sudden death; if I hang on, 
it’s gradual death.” On hearing this, 
the man and dog left hurriedly for 
home, leaving his friend and Bruin to 
fight it out between themselves. 

The minister referred to above can 
safely advise his flock to do likewise— 
let Schmitz, Partridge and all fight it 
out amongst themselves. There is noth¬ 
ing for the negro, no matter which wins.

CUSTOMS THAT OUGHT TO BE 
CHANGED. 

We regret to say that a few of our 
churches still cling to some of those 
old worn-out customs that all other en¬ 
lightened people have discarded. No¬ 
ticeable among them are long, weary 
services, and the system of taking up 
the collection. 

In most of our churches Sunday 
School begins between half after nine 
and ten o’clock, lasting until eleven 
o’clock. Immediately the morning ser¬ 
vices begin by the congregation sing¬ 
ing several hymns; following this some 
long-winded brother will pray a prayer 
from Genesis to the Revelation, then 
a selection from the choir and a ser¬ 
mon by the pastor, which will be fol¬ 
lowed by prayer. While the choir sings 
several selections most of the con¬ 
gregation rises up simultaneously tak¬ 
ing their offerings to the table at the 
altar of the church, after the congrega¬ 
tion is seated again the trustees will 
pass around baskets for the benfit of 
those who did not go to the altar. The 
minister now closes the services by 
making the announcements, which not 
only consist of religious matters but 
other subjects, which certainly must em¬ 
barrass them and ought to be an¬ 
nounced through our newspaper col¬ 
umns, such as balls given by secret so¬ 
cieties, rival political meetings, the 
opening of new junk stores, chop houses 
and tamale stands. This will be no 
earlier than half after one o'clock, the 
services lasting two hours and a half. 
This will be repeated in the evening, 
from half after seven until ten o’clock. 
The result is people are careless about 
church etiquette, the minister is dis¬ 
turbed by the people whispering and 
constantly going in and out of the 
church. 

We are not advocating fashionable 
church services, but we do believe they 
should be conducted with intelligence 
and should be as brief as is expedient. 

In our churches and society we 
should be careful that our very best 
men and women intellectually as well 
as morally should be at the head of 
them and represent them upon all oc¬ 
casions. We must be led by intelligence 
if we are to win. We are too often 
quilty of insulting and humiliating our 
intelligent men and women by pushing 
ahead of them immorality and ignor¬ 
ance. Since vve are to be judged by 
our representative men and women, let 
11s see to it that they are the best among 
us. « 


THOMAS DIXON IN DANGER OF 
MOBBING. 

Columbia, S. C., October 15.—Thomas 
Dixon, the novelist and playwright, es¬ 
caped mob violence in this city early 
this morning, after the performance last 
night of his new play, “The Clansman,” 
dealing with Negro rule in South Caro¬ 
lina during the reconstruction period, 
only by locking himself in his room in 


his hotel. The play had been heartily 
hissed by the large audience which had 
gathered; and later, when a number of 
young men, prominent in society and 
business life, gathered in front of the 
hotel with hostile intent, and sent up a 
note asking the playright to come down; 
he suspected their purpose and refused. 
Balked < in their purpose of doing him 
bodily injury, the young men drew up 
a set of resolutions setting forth in un¬ 
mistakable terms their opinion of the 
author and his play, and had them sent 
to his room. The audience was com¬ 
posed almost entirely of white people, 
scarcely a dozen negroes being in the 
gallery. From these there was no dem¬ 
onstration. The auditors were all dem¬ 
ocrats, so there could be no charge of 
partisanship. 


SOUTHERN REPRESENTATION. 

New York, October 10.—“In the last 
session of congress Senator Platt of 
New York* introduced a bill providing 
for a reduction in the congressional rep¬ 
resentation from those states which dis¬ 
franchised all, or a part, of the negro 
vote. I presume that in the session of 
congress about to begin, Mr. Platt will 
reintroduce that measure. I want to 
serve notice on him and those here in 
New York city who were responsible 
for it that if its passage is seriously at¬ 
tempted, Mr. Platt will discover a buzz 
saw revolving at a rate that will appall 
him.” This was said to a Times re¬ 
porter yesterday by Senator Simmons 
of North Carolina, who is in New York. 
Mr. Simmon's, with Senator Gorman of 
Maryland, will lead the fight against 
Southern reduction when it begins in 
the senate if Mr. Platt again offers his 
bill. 

“Mr. Platt is aiming principally at 
North Carolina, Mississippi, and Ala¬ 
bama, when he seeks to have his resolu¬ 
tion passed,” said Senator Simmons, 
“but in fact he is hitting the whole 
South. The Platt resolution cannot 
pass and the Republican club and its as¬ 
sociates who are agitating the question 
ought to know it.”
