UNLAWFUL HABITUAL COHABI¬ 
TATION BETWEEN THE 
RACES. 

(From the Vicksburg Light.) 

Circuit Court convened here Monday 
morning and judge Anderson delivered 
an able charge -to the grand jury. The 
keynote of his charge was the “Unlawful 
Habitual Cohabitation Between the 
Races,” meaning, of course, white men 
and negro women. 

The following are the words of Judge 
Anderson on the subject which we clip 
from the Vicksburg American: 

Judge Anderson referred in a most 
vehement and determined manner to the 
unlawful habitual cohabitation particu¬ 
larly known to exist between the races, 
saying: “I have touched upon this sub¬ 
ject to other grand juries, and while it 
is painful to me to do so, I intend to 
keep touching upon it until there is the 
arousing of public opinion to that stage 
where something will be done to abate 
the evil. We know that these conditions 
exist, and yet nothing is done. It may 
be possible that some of the grand jur¬ 
ors themselves might have been affected, 
and it was not altogether their state¬ 
ment that they could not get evidence. 
It is a fact, too, that this evil is not 
confined to any caste, or standard of so¬ 
ciety, but the best men of the commu¬ 
nity, men with beautiful wives and 
children at their homes, actually co- 
habitate with negro women, and the re¬ 
sult has been that I believe to a great 
degree, the servant problem has become 
more serious resulting from this condi¬ 
tion of affairs. 

“As I say, we find men indulging 
this evil, in many instances to be the 
very stars of society, who revel am 


enjoy this disgusting and awful indul¬ 
gence, and who in many instances walk 
along the street and meet their unlawful 
children, and see them going along to 
school. 

“The condition has become so ex¬ 
treme that it is to a great degree the 
great problem between the races, as many 
of the good negroes condemn and are 
fighting against it, and they are to be 
praised and upheld in their effort to 
stamp out the evil. 

“It takes us back, gentlemen, to the 
time of our Saviour, who, when He was 
brought face to face with the woman 
who had committed adultery and was 
charged by the many men gathered, 
said, ‘Let him who is without sin cast 
the first stone/ and they all slunk away, 
every son of a tinker of them- And 
this I bring up for you to consider tha/ 
there is the great moral lesson to be 
cited. I contend that from the moral 
point of view the women should not be 
made more to blame than the men. 
There is no use going down, into the 
slums where these disreputable women 
exist, to correct the evil of habitual un¬ 
lawful cohabitation. The example should 
be made of the men who brazenly in¬ 
dulge in this vice, while many of them 
have beautiful wives and daughters who 
are at home, and they are indulging their 
wealth in supporting these disreputable 
women, living double lives. 

“I contend that the man who persist¬ 
ently indulges in this evil—the man who 
is an habitual victim of it—is beneath 
the notice of a respectable cur dog. 
Never under the existing conditions may 
we hope for that elevation of social 
standard to which we claim and wish 
to adhere until we can first clean out 
our town nests, and obliterate such prac¬ 
tices from our country. 

“As I said before, I do not conceive 
that I can bring about a radical reform 
immediately by calling attention to this 
evil, but by hampering away and keep¬ 
ing at the general public feeling, good 
1 can be accomplished. 


“Several days ago a prominent lawyer 
friend of mine came to me and asked 
me why I did not call particular atten¬ 
tion to those social degenerates, and I 
told him that I had, and that the news¬ 
papers had always noticed it. He had 
not seen what the papers had said, so 
it goes to show that there has not been 
enough done. A sensation sometimes 
does good, so we want a sensation along 
this line of moral upbuilding, and by 
the help of God, so long as I remain in 
office I shall do my duty as I see it, re¬ 
gardless of fear or favor. 

“I think that, as I said before, the 
servant question is greatly chargeable to 
this bad practice of the white men. In 
many instances we see that instead of 
the servant being willing to give refer¬ 
ence, she wants reference before she will 
go to work.” 

In concluding his charge, Judge An¬ 
derson referred to the lessening of crime 
and felony in Warren countv, with a 
great deal of pride, and cited the few 
cases of heavy crimes that have been 
committed. He said that social evils arc 
evidently paramount for the people to 
combat now, and regardless of criticism, 
he intends to do his duty in calling at¬ 
tention to these evils, just so long as 
he shall remain in office— Washington

WOMAN SWEARS AWAY HIS LIFE 
FOR TEN DOLLARS. 

Raleigh, N. C, March 20.— Governor 
Glenn has received a letter purporting 
to have come from Mrs. Ida Hales, on 
whose testimony Walter Partridge, a 
negro, is under sentence to be hanged 
at Fayetteville on April 6 fer a criminal 
attack upon her. She declares that her 
testimony at the trial, fastening the 
crime upon- Partridge, was false and that 
she was paid $10 for it- She says that 
Partridge was not within three miles of 
the scene at the time and she is anxious 
for an opportunity to right the wrong 
she has committed. The Governor has 
ordered an investigation.

THE li^hKa i uk. 


TILLMAN GANG ORDERED TO 
THE REAR. 

President Roosevelt has nominated 
the well-known and popular colored Re¬ 
publican, Mr. Charles W. Anderson, as 
Collector of Internal Revenue of New 
York. The position pays $4,500 per 
year and is one of the best within the 
gift of the administration. This action 
will be cordially approved by the con¬ 
servative people of this country and en¬ 
thusiastically endorsed b w Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans everywhere. 

In doing this, Mr. Roosevelt has dealt 
a left-handed blow at Senator B. R. 
1 illman of South Carolina and admin¬ 
istered a tel^ig rebuke to all who sup¬ 
ported him. Pie conclusively proves 
that he did no more to South Carolina 
in the appointment of Dr. W. D. Crum 
as Collector of Customs of the Port of 
Charleston than he was willing to do 
for New York in the appointment of 
Mr. Charles W. Anderson. 

The negro-haters are silenced, and ac¬ 
cordingly are accorded the privilege of 
“going ’w-a-y back and sit down."— 
Richmond Planet. 


IMMENSE WEALTH IN 
CHURCHES. 

It will not be disputed, we believe, 
that we have enough church edifices for 
the present. During the past forty years 
we have spent a vast amount of our en¬ 
ergies and savings in building churches; 
and this was necessary, as we owned 
but few at the close of the war. Few 
people know or realize how very exten¬ 
sively this church building work among 
Afro-Americans has gone on, and how 
much of our energies and savings have 
been expended in it during the past 
forty years. The latest statistics place 
the total number of churches among 
Baptists, Methodists and Presbyterians 
at 25,812, and the total membership at 
2,186,573. The Baptists alone have 15,- 
614 churches and 1,625,330 members. If 
these 25,812 churches be rated at an 


average value of $1,000, we have a to¬ 
tal of $25,812,000. The church property 
owned by Episcopalians, Congregational- 
ists and other small groups will easily 
swell the total to $30,000,000- That a 
people, starting empty-handed out of a 
slave condition forty years ago, and per¬ 
sistently libelled as being half barbarian 
and utterlv without morality, should 
create this body of non-productive 
wealth, besides maintaining themselves, 
educating their children by taxation in 
the public schools, and accumulating 
some $450,000,000 of real and personal 
wealth, makes one of the most remark¬ 
able showings in the history of mankind 
in ancient or modern times. 

* * * 

We have the churches; most of them 
are paid for; they are a necessary and 
valuable but unproductive asset, that is 
to say, they pay no cash dividends. Now 
let us bend our energies and surplus 
earnings to the greater stimulation of 
our business development, and if we 
shall show the same earnestness, pa¬ 
tience and self-sacrifice in this work in 
the next forty years that we have shown 
in church building in the past forty, the 
change for the better in the condition 
and status of the race a half century 
hence will be marvelous indeed .—New 
York Age. 


NEGRO DEPARTMENT STORE. 

Richmond. Va., March 11.—Headed by 
Maggie L. Walker, who is president of 
St. Luke’s Bank, a flourishing institu¬ 
tion of Richmond. 22 negro women to¬ 
day secured a charter from the Corpora¬ 
tion Commission and will at once open 
a big store, to be known as the St. Luke’s 
Emporium. The authorized capital of the 
company is $25,000, but it is the purpose 
to largely increase it if the venture is 
successful. The shares are $10 each, 
and all of them are being purchased by 
negroes. While one or two men are on 
the board of directors, and a man, Jos. 
N. Meyers, is vice-president, the whoie 


business practically is in the hands nf 
women. The head of the business, Mag¬ 
gie L. Walker, has been a leading fig¬ 
ure in the business world here for some 
time. Under her guidance St. Luke’s 
Bank has become a flourishing institu¬ 
tion, and negroes are being trained to 
save their money, and to deposit it reg¬ 
ularly. The women connected with the 
new store are wives and daughters of 
leading negro residents, many of whom 
own property apd have comfortable bank 
accounts. 


THE NEGRO COMING. 

The great heart of the world—the 
soul of the world—that hates no man 
because of his creed, his color or his 
nationality, will rejoice at the honors 
that have come to the humble negro 
janitor in Chicafgo whose paintings have, 
commanded the critics’ unstinted praise. 
Day by day the negro is fighting down 
the prejudices that have so long existed 
against him in mean minds; he is paint¬ 
ing pictures, he is weaving songs, he is 
upholding the nation’s flag, paying his 
debts, serving God, and slowly but surely 
coming to his own in every other way.— 
The Times .. 

The above from the Timese was writ¬ 
ten by the man that God made, for there 
is an editorial writer on the staff of that 
make. He must have a hard time asso- 
caiting with those 2x4 devil-made fel¬ 
lows who think it’s smart to imitate 
low down ignorant negroes by referring 
to the negro as a “coon.” How sad it 
is to fill the vocabularies of innocent 
white boys and girls with the billings¬ 
gate picked up in negro crap dives. The 
negro crap shooter certainly stands high 
in the estimation of some white folks. 


A NEW RESTAURANT. 

Messrs. Amos and Bell, two enterpris¬ 
ing young men, have opened a first-class 
restaurant at 843 San Pedro street. 
Home cooked meals and ice cream are 
served at all hours.

MUNSON FOR CITY TREASURER. 

Mr. Spencer Munson, candidate for 
City Treasurer of Pasadena, deserves the 
vote of every colored voter in that city. 
We have known him personally for 
many years. During his long business 
career as dealer in hardware his adver¬ 
tisement was always found in the col¬ 
ored papers. His friendship for the ne¬ 
groes has been helpful and sincere. Mi. 
Munson's business relations with his 
former patrons were so pleasant that we 
dare say every one of them will vote 
for him. He ought to be elected; he 
deserves it. He should have the solid 
colored vote. 


has a righteous ruler. Long live Theo¬ 
dore Roosevelt, President of all the 
American people. 


Mr. Spencer M. Munson. 

At the municipal election Monday, 
April 3, the voters of Pasadena will be 
called upon to select men for several 
important offices in the government of 
the city. One of these offices is that of 
treasurer and tax and license collector, 
and it behooves the citizens to place 
a man in that office who is in every way 
thoroughly competent to perform the 
duties of that position. 

In Spencer M. Munson the voters can 
rest assured that they have a man who is 
competent in every way for the duties 
of the office to which he aspires. He 
has lived in Pasadena since 1886 and has 
been prominently identified with the 
city's business interests. At the earnest 
solicitation of his friends, Mr. Munson 
consented last November to become a 
candidate for the office of city treasurer. 
His long residence here has made him 


MR, SLAVIN’S ELECTION CER¬ 
TAIN. 

If there have been any doubts of 
Mr. Slavin’s election as Mayor the 
Water Bond election has wiped them 
out. His friends say the only question 
now is the size of his majority. Mr. 
Slavin is a broad-minded, progressive 
business man, who is not only popular 
with the business people, but with the 
working people as well. Through his 
extensive building operations the work¬ 
ing men have found abundant employ¬ 
ment. The attempt to prejudice the col¬ 
ored voters against him has signally 
failed. If he had any dislikes for the 
negro, as a member of the City Council 
he bad numerous opportunities to show 
it, but his vote in that body was re¬ 
corded in favor of them whenever it 
was needed. The liberal representation 
given the colored voters in the Street 
Department had not only his approval, 


MR. ANDERSON CONFIRMED 
A NATIONAL ERA. 

The confirmation of. Mr. Chas. W 
Anderson, as Collector of Internal 
Revenue, for the Second District of New 
York, was a graceful act upon the part of 
the Senate. The President by this ap¬ 
pointment, shows that he knows neither 
section nor color,' in the execution of 
the laws. He has inaugurated an era 
in which fitness is to be the only con¬ 
sideration—A national era. An era that 
is to make this nation the strongest on 
earth, not in munitions of war, but in 
manly strength and righteousness. The 
Door of Hope has been thrown open, 
merit only is to be rewarded for the next 
four years at least. If the present policy 
of “All men up,” and not that of some 
men down,” could be kept in for the next 
fifty years, this country would in truth, 
be “The land of the free, and the home 
of the brave/ Happy is that people that 


familiar to most of our citizens, and the 
very substantial support that he has re¬ 
ceived attests to his popularity and makes 
him one of the most prominent candi¬ 
dates for that office. 

A word or two about the law regard¬ 
ing the care of public funds will be . of 
interest to voters. As the law is now, 
it provides that the public funds cannot 
be deposited in anv bank in the ordinary 
way, but that they must be placed in a 
vault, consequently the money belonging 
to the citv of Pasadena is in a vault 
rented by the city for that purpose, and 
is in gold coin and gold certificates. This 
portion of the law is so clear that any 
voter can readily see that no candidate 
can make an ante-election statement 
about placing the public funds with the 
various banks of the city. 

There is an amendment to this pres¬ 
ent law which was passed by the recent 
session of the Legislature, and which 
will be submitted to the voters at the 


















THE LIBERATOR. 


State election in November, 1906, for 
their ratification, which provides for the 
depositing of public monies in banks. 
If this amendment is carried at that 
election, the selection of a depository 
for public funds is out of the hands of 
the treasurer entirely, as the law pro¬ 
vides where and how the monies will be 
deposited. 

Mr. Munson assures the voters that 
if elected he will devote his whole time 
to the duties of the office and see that 
the public monies are -taken care of ac¬ 
cording to law. 


SHIBLY FOR COUNCILMAN. 

Mr. William Shibly, candidate for 
the City Council, is another gentleman 
whose friendship for the colored voters 
entitles him to their support. He enjoys 
their utmost confidence and will get 
their vote. 


Messrs. Davis and Johnson, . con¬ 
tractors, whose card appears elsewhere 
in these columns, are prepared to do all 
kinds of cement and sewer work, and 
solicit your order. All work done 
promptly; satisfaction guaranteed. When 


you need their services, ring up South

Mr. T. M. McClellan. 

When the new Wesley Chapel church 
is completed few of its members will 
take greater pride in it than Mr. T. 
M. McClellan. The success of the old 
church, which cost $2300.00 and sold 
for $24,000.00, making the magnificent 
new church possiDle, was due very large¬ 
ly to his untiring efforts. The members 
of the board of trustees of which he 
was president were a group of church 
builders—all good and true men. 


A BIT OF CONSOLATION. 

The Atlanta Constitution, commenting 
upon the appointments Mr. Anderson as 
Collector of Internal Revenue, for the 
Second District of New York, says, the 
position does not bring Anderson into 
the close social relation that is enjoyed 
by a negro post master in a southern 
village, and therefore his appointment 
is not a test case. This seems rather 
far fetched, as Mr. Anderson will have 
among his subordinates, two hundred 
white men and women, we have not 
heard of a post office in the south held 
by a negro with such a handsome list of 
subordinates. Where this social rela¬ 
tion comes in through office holding, no 
man not insane from jealousy and race 
hate, can see. We- see white girls de¬ 
livering mail to negroes every day, with 
out any thought of social relations, wc 
we see them soliciting orders and selling 
goods, and often acting as nurses for 
negroes, without a thought of social re¬ 
lation. 

What constitutes social relations in 
the south any way? Out here official 
and business relations are one thing, 
and social relation is another.

THE HUMILIATION OF RUSSIA. 

Russia's attempt to steal Manchuria, 
divide up China, absorb Corea and 
finally subjubate Japan is meeting with 
a dismal failure. Her occupation of 
Manchuria by false pretense was a part 
of the plan to steal all the territory in 
sight, belonging to the dark races and 
murder all persons in the territory 
stolen who had the hardihood to oppose 
it. Of course, the other so-called Chris* 
tian nations would have submitted to 
the robbery and butchery under the 
pretense that white sunremacv, Chris¬ 
tianity, civilization demanded the 
slaughter of men and raping of women 
in their own homes. But Japan took 
time by the forelock and is wiping up 
the earth with her. She gave Russia so 
many days to get out of Manchuria, 
which the haughty Slavs refused to do, 
only to be flung out bodily as a strong 
man would a burglar. Russia's navy, 
the proud Pacific fleet, decorates the 
bottom of the ocean. Her second 
souadron is afraid to leave her coast 
line. Her army having won not a 
rinede battle, has been beaten and driven 
from pillar to post, and today it is not 
allowed to stop long enough to cook a 
meal. 

The Russian defeat at Mukden was 
the most crushing, the most humiliating 
in the history of modern warfare. It 
win^d out completely whatever was left 
of Russian prestige with her navy de¬ 
stroyed, her army, in the far east, anni¬ 
hilated, anarchy and revolution at home. 
Russia is indeed in the vale of pity and 
humiliation. The end is not yet. 

Of her losses at Mukden there were 
200.000 men, 110.000 of whom were 
killed or wounded. 

The spoils include two flags, about 60 
guns. 60 rifles, 150 ammunition wagons, 
1000 bushels of cereals. 275,000 bushels 
of fodder. 45 miles of light railway out¬ 
fit, 2000 horses. 2 3 cartloads of maps, 
1000 cartloads of clothing and accouter¬ 
ments, 1,000.000 rations of bread, 70,- 
000 tons of fuel and 60 tons of hay, be¬ 
sides tools, tents, bullocks, telegraph 
v, ire and poles, timber, beds, stoves and 
much other property. 

Later reports bring up the Russian 
losses, so far as it has been possible, 
to count them, to these figures: Rus¬ 
sian casualties, 110.000: guns captured, 
66: rifles, 62.000: shells, 211,500. 

Besides, Kuroki reports that al¬ 
though the retreating Russians set fire 
to the warehouses at Machuntan and 
Miulunao. he captured thousands of 
bushels of provisions, immense quanti¬ 
ties of ammunition and fodder, num¬ 
bers of horses and bullocks, materials 
for a light railwav thirtv-three miles 
long, 450 wagons for railway, 6000 in¬ 
trenching tools. 12,000 bundles nf wire, 
numerous telephones, coal mining ma¬ 
chinery for eight pits (the mines being 
at I tsl’rn), and great stores of char¬ 
coal. 

What a warning this should serve 
upon this and other countries that are 


allowing robbers and murderers of the 
weak to go unpunished. Allow it to be 
done under whatever pretext you may, 
the punishment will follow as sure as 
God lives, for “The God that reigned 
over Babylon is the God that is reign¬ 
ing now." 

Down in Mississippi it takes five 
hundred armed white people to lynch 
one unarmed negro for whipping a 
white man. It is now suggested that 
all the white nation on earth form 
a mob, on the Mississippi plan, and go 
over and lynch the little brown^ men 
for whipping Russia for attempting a 
hold up game in the far east. But 
these brothers have such a little confi¬ 
dence in each other that they cannot 
reach an agreement, fearing that some 
of them might slip back home and steal 
all that's left. Then, too, the promiscu¬ 
ous mingling would result in wholesale 
pocket picking. Evil is sometimes pro¬ 
ductive of good.
