THE LIBERATOR. 


Coroner Trout Blunders. 

JACKSON MUST FACE A JURY 
FOR THE MURDER OF 
JAMES LOGAN. 

The announcement that J. C. C. Jack- 
son must stand for the murder of James 
Logan, gives general satisfaction to the 
Afro-Americans, who had begun to think 
that the case was about dropped, with¬ 
out any sincere effort on the part of 
the state to run down the cowardly per¬ 
petrators of the deed. The predicament 
that Jackson finds himself in is wholly 
his own fault. His flat refusal to prove 
an alibi and thus secure not only his 
liberty, but free himself from a suspi¬ 
cion that would blast the life of any 
man, is a mystery as deep and dark as 
the mystery of the murder itself. Jack- 
son, besides being a member in good 
standing of the A. M. E. Church, is 
a member of the Masonic, K. of P and 
Odd Fellows’ societies, and president 
of the San Gabriel Investment Co. On 
the night of the murder Jackson was 
absent from the meeting of the com¬ 
pany, over which it was his duty to pre¬ 
side, arriving at the meeting at 9:30 
o’clock, just before adjournment. Lo¬ 
gan was murdered between the hours of 
8 and 9:30 o’clock that night. Jackson 
and Logan were seen together twice the 
day just preceding the murder. The 
conference between them is said to have 
been unusually friendly, a coldness hav¬ 
ing existed between them previously. 
The long, thin-bladed knife with which 
Logan had been deliberately butchered, 
found not far from the body, tallied with 
one sold Jackson some months before 
the murder. The puffer with which the 
man’s skull had been repeatedly crushed, 
found near the scene of the crime, bore 
the private price mark of one sold to 
Jackson’s wife a short time before the 
murder. Jackson gives as the reason 
for his absence from the meeting, “That 
he was fitting a suit on a customer on 
Lake street,” but has made no effort to 
produce the man in court. The white 
man, Goldy, who was working for 
Jackson, left for Massachusetts imme¬ 
diately after the murder, and when ar¬ 
rested at Brockton, Mass., claimed that 
he did not know Jackson, but finally ad- 
mitted that he had just left Jacksons 
employ, and gave some damaging tes- 
timony against him. It is claimed far¬ 
ther that Jackson, the day after the mur¬ 
der, requested Rev. Hunter, a member 
of the company, to swear that he (Jack- 
son) presided at the meeting, lhese 
scraps of circumstantial evidence coupled 
with his flat refusal to establish an alibi 
amount practically to a tacit admission 
of a knowledge of the crime. 

DID JACKSON COMMIT THE MURDER? 

The prevailing belief among Afro- 
Americans that Jackson and Goldy were 
present when Logan was murdered, and 
one or both of them held him while he 


was being slowly butchered by some 
white man who was crazed with a thirst 
for blood and revenge. The 24 ghastly 
knife wounds in his abdomen were in¬ 
flicted first perhaps to cause intense ag- 
ony without producing instant death, 
the thing that a hired murderer would 
have sought to accomplish. The muti¬ 
lation of the remains after death and 
other nameless indignities offered the 
corpse point unmistakably to revenge as 
the motive. If Jackson and Goldy took 
any part in the deed, it was for money. 

DID THE CORONER BLUNDER? 

When the jury at the Logan inquest 
called for his bloody clothes, it was in¬ 
formed by the undertaker having charge 
of the body that the clothes had been 
burned by order of the coroner. If the 
statement is true, what could have been 
the coroner’s reason for such an un¬ 
heard-of proceeding in such a case? i he 
clothing might have contained some clue 
that might have lead to the identity of 
the murderers, and ought to have been 
preserved at all hazards. A bloody hand¬ 
kerchief found near Logan’s body was 
taken from the body while the inauest 
was in session. Who got that handker¬ 
chief? Is it possible that some person 
not a member of the jury stole it from 
the body in the-jury’s presence? If the 
coroner ordered the clothes burned, it 
was a serious blunder, and may have 
covered the murderer’s tracks. With the 
clothing burned and the bloody hand¬ 
kerchief again in his possession, the 
murderer doubtless congratulated him¬ 
self on the completeness of his grew- 
some, cowardly job. 

We trust that Jackson is innocent of 
complicity in that awful deed, and will 
come forward and vindicate himself, as 
any good man and citizen should dp. 
To attempt to escape by technicality will 
fasten upon him a dark suspicion that 
will hound him to a dishonored grave; 
a suspicion that will drive him from the 
church, society and state; a suspicion 
that will make him an outcast among 
his fellows and plunge him into unend¬ 
ing, hopeless despair; a suspicion that 
will make the mention of his name odi- 
011c tn every member of his race. 

Will Jackson lose his life if he tells 
of his whereabouts on the night Logan 
was murdered? 


FIFTEEN HUNDRED AFRO-AMER¬ 
ICANS VISIT FURLONG 
ON THE FOURTH. 

After the old Southern fashion, the 
Afro-Americans of Furlong celebrated 
the Fourth of July, with a grand barbe¬ 
cue and speech-making. Fifteen hun¬ 
dred Afro-Americans enjoyed the fes¬ 
tivities of the day and returned to their 
homes in various parts of the city and 
suburbs delighted with an outing the 
like of which they had not witnessed 
since leaving the sunny South. Lawn 
tennis, croquet and baseball were the 
sports engaged in. So orderly and dig¬ 
nified was the crowd that the whole re¬ 


sembled a gathering of students on a col¬ 
lege campus. . . 

Furlong as an Afro-American munici¬ 
pality within the city having its own 
mayor and council and other officers, 
differing from the latter only in 
the fact that it has no police or 
police department. Editor T. A. Greene 
is mayor; Messrs. Harry Mitchell, 
Capt. F. H. Crumbly, B. W. Sikes, 

C. C. Leake are members of the coun¬ 
cil Editor Greene, secretary of the col¬ 
ored Y. M. C. A., is a college-bred gen¬ 
tleman ,and a safe and sane leader. Mr. 
Mitchell is a successful real estate dealer 
and business man. Mr. Sikes is mail 
distributor in the city postoffice, where 
he has been empolyed more than ten 
years. Capt. F. H. Crumbly is an At¬ 
lanta, Ga., man, a fit representative ol 
that educational center. Capt. Crumbly 
rendered Uncle Sam valuable service in 
the Philippines as captain in the 49th 
Infantry. Mr. C. C. Leake is a maker 
of chaffs and fancy settees. From 
among the above named gentlemen the 
city could get a councilman that would 
lend dignity to its law-making body and 
throw a dark cloud between the graft¬ 
ers and the taxpayers, whom they keep 
in constant dismay. 

But to our subject. The celebration 
and everything pertaining thereto was 
a success. The speakers were Prof. A. 

D. Langston of St. Louis. Mo., son of 
ex-Congressman John M. Langston; 
Lieut. Col. Allen, Allensworth; Prof. 
James C. Moore, Rev. W. H. Peck, C. C. 
Flint and Editor Greene. The speeches 
were not only helpful, but inspiring. The 
barbecued meat was all that could be 
desired, and there wasn’t any of it left. 
The affair netted the Improvement As¬ 
sociation $100. 

Under the beautiful pepper trees that 
beautify the little park, seats had been 
placed for the accommodation of the vis¬ 
itors. In front of these a platform had 
been erected for the speakers. Upon 
those seats' sat Afro-Americans from 
nearly if not every state in the Union. 
The crowd represented every shade of 
complexion from jet black to the pure 
blonde. Among them were sons, grand¬ 
sons and daughters of white Southern 
statesmen and leaders who formed the 
Southern chivalry of long ago—a chival¬ 
ry now long dead. It was a gathering 
of kindred spirits, representing every de¬ 
partment of Afro-American push and 
progress. After a day profitably and 
pleasantly spent, “America” was sung 
with a will, three cheers were given foi 
Furlonr, and the members of the gather¬ 
ing—wiser, better and happier for the 
day—left for their homes. 


Wanted—Every Afro-American fam¬ 
ily to subscribe for and read The Liber¬ 
ator. Once a month it will visit your 
fireside like a letter from home. It 
stands for equality before the law and 
equality of opportunity. When these 
shall have become living realities. The 
Liberator will devote its energies to oth¬ 
er patriotic endeavors.

Root and Taft Must Bs 
Left at Home. 

PREPARING TO BOLT THE RE¬ 
PUBLICAN TICKET IN 1908. 

Should Secretary Taft or Secretary 
Root receive the Republican nomination 
in 1908, the party will witness a disas¬ 
trous bolt of the Afro-American voters. 
The present administration, of which the 
gentlemen named form prominent parts, 
has violated every pledge made the Afro- 
American in the platform upon which 
the present administration was elected. 
The door of Hope, the “All men up,” 
etc., “The square deal,” and the “Durbin 
anti-lynching letter,” that made the Pres¬ 
ident so popular with the lovers of fair 
play, are regarded now as merely the 
bates of the politicians and office seek¬ 
ers to secure the colored vote. If these 
grandiloquent expressions had any other 
object, the President’s actions toward the 
Afro-Americans have failed to prove it. 
In all of his writings the President 
never said anything commendable about 
the Afro-American till he became a can¬ 
didate. By flattery he hoodwinked the 
gullible Afro-American and got his vote. 
Since his election he has given them the 
“cold shoulder.” PTe has fraternized with 
Senator Buffoon Rogue Tillman and oth¬ 
er rabid Negro-haters, constitution nulli- 
fyers and mob leaders. The promise to 
cut down Southern representation has 
been treated with contempt. The Afro- 
American voters have enough of the 
President and his cabinet, and the last 
Congress as well. 

Commenting on Secretary Taft’s 
North Carolina bid for Afro-American 
delegates to the next Republican na¬ 
tional convention, the Washington Bee 
says in part as follows: 

SECRETARY TAFT’S SPEECH. 

Mr. Taft went to North Carolina this 
week and unloaded himself. He went 
to advise the Republicans of the state 
how to unite. It will be remembered 
that Mr. Taft is a candidate for the 
Presidential nomination. He had to t*ke 
his text on the Negro and the so-called 
ignorant white man. All candidates for 
office, more or less, tell about the wrongs 
a^inst the colored voter. Mr. Roose¬ 
velt in one breath abused them and in an¬ 
other he praised them. He assailed them 
before he was a candidate for office and 
praised them after he became a candi¬ 
date. The colored man is an easy vic¬ 
tim to flattery. 

* * * 

Why was it necessary for Mr. Taft to 
go South and tell the Southern people 
what to do for the negro and ignorant 
whites? Mr. Taft is Secretary of War. 
Mr. Roosevelt is president, under whom 
he serves. Both branches of Congress 
contain a Republican majority. Why 
didn’t this Congress enforce the very 
things of which 'Mr. Taft complained 
in North Carolina?. He is the Secre¬ 


tary of War and a member of the cab¬ 
inet over which his chief presides. Will 
Republican politicians continue to de¬ 
ceive the colored voter? Is there to be 
no end to this rot? Will Mr. Taft 
explain to the country his reasons for 
going South and telling the white peo¬ 
ple what to do for thv; colored vote and 
citizen when his OWN chief and his 
OWN Congress have the power to do 
it? It is a bid for delegates to the next 
National Republican Convention. It is 
another spectacular exhibition of politi¬ 
cal buffoonery. The colored voter sees 
through it all and he will not be fooled 
again. He has had enough promises 
and he doesn’t propose to take any more. 
This speech may deceive a few milk and 
water black Republicans, but it will 
never deceive The Bee. Mr. Taft must 
adopt some other method to secure col¬ 
ored delegates to the next Republican 
convention. 


CORONER TROUT LEFT AGAIN. 
SIMPSON A FREE MAN. 

Henry Simpson, whom Coroner Trout 
held on a charge of murder for killin'* 
Harry Elton, a white man, in self-de¬ 
fense, was promptly acquitted when the 
case was given to a jury in the Superior 
Court. The verdict of the jury endorses 
the position taken by The Liberator at 
the time. Taking the actions of the cor¬ 
oner in the Godfrey and Elton cases, 
we believed that race prejudice played a 
part prejudicial to the impartial enforce¬ 
ment of the law. We believed that the 
coroner’s verdicts in the cases mentioned 
would tend to cheapen the lives of Afro- 
Americans, which has been proven by 
frequent wanton attacks upon members 
of the race by white toughs, and threats 
of lynching when they had the nanhood 
to strike back. 

The Liberator’s comments on the coro¬ 
ner’s left-handed verdicts when Afro- 
Americans were concerned has cost him 
the colored vote of this city and county, 
i he Afro-American is becomirg more 
and more jealous of bis rights. In other 
words we are educating them. 

Another thing that is well to mention 
here, and that is that Afro-Americans 
must have no communication whatever 
with immoral white men and women. 
The worst and most dangerous element 
with which the Afro-American can deal 
are the ignorant, immoral white folks. 
The intelligent, upright people are our 
friends everywhere, although sometime 
and in some places they are afraid to 
speak their sentiments. Bv clean lives 
arid industrious habits let us as a face 
increase the strength and number of our 
friends. For the good of himself and 
the race, we trust that Sjmnson and all 
flke him in the future will keep away 
from places visited by immoral whites. 


Wanted—Every member of the race to 
subscribe and pay from one to twenty- 
five dollars per year for the support of 
the Afro-American Y. M. C. A. soon to 
be opened in this city. 


A WHITE CHILD BURNED AT 
THE STAKE. 

During the month of May three white 
persons were lynched. One of the vic¬ 
tims was a little white child, burned at 
the stake by his playmates at Cedar 
Grove, Va., May 31st. The unfortunate 
child was tied to a stake and shavings 
were piled around him and lighted. The 
little one was burned so badly before 
rescued that he died immediately after. 
I he Associated Press, feeling itself re¬ 
sponsible for the crime owing to the 
lessons it has taught the children of this 
country in Negro burning, claimed that 
the children were imitating the Red 
Men’s initiation of a new member. The 
Red Men’s initiations are private, there¬ 
fore they could not have been imitating 
them. 

Monday, May 29th, Robert T. Rogers, 
a white man, was taken from jail at 
1 allaulah, La., and lynched for the mur¬ 
der of a white man two years before. 
Fearing that Rogers would escape the 
penalty prescribed by law, a mob lynched 
him. 

J. V. Johnson was lynched at Wades^ 
hefro. North Carolina, by a mob of two 
hundred white men. Johnson was strung 
up a tree and his body riddled with 
bullets. He murdered his brother-in- 
law. and at his trial the jury disagreed. 

There were, of course, several Ne¬ 
groes lynched during the same month, 
but that lias become so common that they 
are passed unnoticed. The Governors of 
these states declare that the lynchers 
shall he punished. Had they pursued 
a similar course in the cases of Negroes 
lynched, the white men would* have been 
spared such fates. 


JUSTICE OVERTAKES HIM. 

The killing of Geo. Mitchell by his 
sister Esther was swift and just pun¬ 
ishment for his cold-blooded murder of 
Edmund Creffield. The murder of Cref- 
field was premeditated and cold-blooded. 
Although he came across the continent 
to commit the crime, a jury acquitted 
him in violation of the law and evidence. 
Creffield was the Mitchell girl’s spirit¬ 
ual adviser and friend. The plea that 
he had wronged the eirl, even if true, 
did not justify the taking of the law in 
his own hands. The blood of George 
Mitchell will be required at the hands of 
the jury. Ft is hoped that Esther has 
taught cold-blooded murderers a whole¬ 
some lesson. “The wages of sin is 
death," and no class of sinners is more 
deserving of death than cold-blooded 
murderers. 


Wanted—More Afro-Americans to en¬ 
gage in farming. The opportunities foi> 
them to rapidly become independent are 
almost boundless in Southern Califor¬ 
nia. A willingness to work is the farm¬ 
er’s main capital.

INTER-MARRIAGE OF THE RACES 

Some of the Southern ladies residing 
in our midst are all wrought up over 
something Bishop Hamilton said about 
the solution of the race problem. The 
fear that the white and black races will 
mix has driven Mrs. Wotton, a South¬ 
ern lady, to write a letter to The Times 
if the white and black races should mix. 
telling what awful things will happen. 
The white and black races have been 
mixed, and badly mixed, so long that 
it is a little strange that any person, at 
least in this country, should be ignorant 
of that fact. This case is a little worse 
than that of the Irishman who beat a 
Jew nearly to death for killing Christ. 
The Jew, as soon as he got his wind, 
established an alabi by proving that 
Christ had been killed a thousand years 
before his birth. The Irishman, look¬ 
ing astonished, said, “But you see I just 
heard of the killing today.” 

To us it. doesn't seem to be. the part 
of wisdom to lie awake at night, pull 
your hair and harrass your neighbors 
to prevent something from being done 
that has already been accomplished. Life 
is too short. . 

This old rot about races superiority 
has been exploded and thrown into the 
mental waste basket so long that to 


mention it puts one’s intellectual and 
religious training under the ban of sus¬ 
picion. 

It’s the same old story—every race 
that has enslaved another by face, mur¬ 
der, robbery, perjury and duplicity, has 
set up this claim of inherent superiority. 
Thus the Romans were inherently super¬ 
ior to the Britons, Anglo-Saxons and 
Teutons. The Greeks were inherently 
superior to the nations they conquered. 
So Nimrod, the “mighty hunter before 
the Lord, a descendant of Ham and 
ancestor of the black race, was inherent¬ 
ly superior to all of the descendants of 
Noah, including the present white 
race; and so on from Nero down to 
Tillman and Vardaman. 

Booker T. Washington and Frederick 
Douglass were the sons of Southern 
white men by ignorant negro women. 
In each case the son has outshone his 
father. Negroes have never shown any 
great desire to marry white women. To 
the credit of the negro men, practically 
all of the mulattoes in this country 
have white .fathers and helpless, defense¬ 
less black mothers. And all of their 
fathers were Southern white men of 
“gentle breeding.” In the days of slave¬ 
ry the time the races were mixed 
the poor white trash were not allowed 
to consort with the virtuous, stalwart 
black slave women. That was a^ privi¬ 
lege enjoyed only by those of “gentle 
breeding.” The writer was a plantation 
slave and lived in the South forty years. 

The whites and negroes are inter¬ 
marrying every day, and when it comes 
to unlawful mixing, the South beats the 
world. That’s the hot-bed of unlawful 
cohabitation between the races. 

The negroes are well satisfied with 
their women. It's the other fellow that’s 
continually slipping into our back yard. 

If the white woman is willing and 
persistent, black men how and then con¬ 
sent to marry them. Only a short lime 
ago a pretty, yotmg white woman in this 
city asked the court to grant her a di¬ 
vorce from her negro husband on the 
ground that he had deserted her for a 
jet black negro woman. Wasn’t that 
something awful? If the white ladies 
will just keep their men at home, we 
will guarantee them that there will be 
a shortage in the mulatto crop next year. 


WALKER FOR PRESIDENT. 

Mr. Eugene Walker is a candidate for 
president of the Afro-American State 
Council. He is a successful business 
man, and the congress would make no 
mistake by electing him. Mr. Alexan¬ 
der, the present incumbent, is being 
backed by the Council for a federal po¬ 
sition. This he deserves, and he should 
Vnve the-united p’mnort of the race, t he 
election of Mr. Walker would unite all 
of the factions and make the Council 
what it shoulde be. Let us unite, breth¬ 
ren. 


MIXED MARRIAGES. ' 

Los Angeles, July 28.—(To the Editor 
of The Times). Will you give space in 
your valuable paper for the purpose of 
entering my protest against the views 
expressed by Bishop Hamilton — like¬ 
wise the gentleman from Colegrove— 
in recent issues of your paper. 

I, being a Southern woman, very much 
regret that a Southern man promulgates 
the doctrine that he has preached in re¬ 
gard to the inter-marrying of the white 
and colored races, as there is no true 
Southern person would admit such a 
thing into their family. 

I, for one, would sorely regret should 
my child marry a negress and would dis¬ 
own them for life, and if Bishop Ham¬ 
ilton would admit such a thing into his 
family, it would be better that he claim 
Africa for his native land instead of the 
beautiful Sunny South. 

It is a matter of note that when two 
persons of unequal class marry, the su¬ 
perior mind too often deteriorates in¬ 
stead of lifting the inferior one to its 
height. 

If this intermarrying of the refined 
cultured Southron with the coarse unin¬ 
telligent negro, became general, very 
soon the boasted gentle breeding of the 
South, which is instantly recognized 
wherever met, would be a matter of 
past history. 

I am for the uplifting and betterment 
of the colored people in every reason¬ 
able way, but believe the best results 
would be obtained by keeping the races 
distinct. 

It may be the right of any individual 
to marry whom he pleases if the future 
generations ate not to be considered; 
but if they are, their common-sense’ and 
not “pashion” must guide. 

MRS. M. A. WOTTON. 

GREATER HOTEL CANADIAN. 

Owing to the immense patronage of 
the Canadian, under the management of 
Mr. B. R. Randolph an addition has been 
built larger than the original. The new 
addition is nearing completion, and when 
finished will contain 84 bedrooms. 1 wo 
large private dining rooms will be added 
for the use of families. This speaks 
well for Mr. Randlop, who has had 
charge only six months. _ 

Wanted—Our business and profession¬ 
al men and all others interested in the 
welfare of race, to join the Afro-Ameri¬ 
can Council and make it what it should 
be, or form another organization that 
shall promote the unity and advance¬ 
ment of the race. 

MR. W. B. B. TAYLOR. 

The many friends of Mr. W. B. B. 
Taylor, Sawtelle Precinct No. 2, have 
asked him to allow them to elect him a 
delegate to the Republican County Con¬ 
vention, and he has permitted them to 
use his name. Mr. Taylor without doubt 
will be elected by a good majority. Saw¬ 
telle Precinct No. 1 is entitled to two 
delegates, and No. 2 is entitled to three 
delegates.

is entitled to a square deal and a fair 
chance, it is the one who has had the 
most to contend with and has shown his 
manhood by growing out of most limita¬ 
tion. 

Ihe colored man who behaves him¬ 
self, is industrious, improves his mind 
and lives an upright, honest life, is en¬ 
titled to just as much generous treat¬ 
ment as the white man who does the 
same thing. 

To get away from false standards 
ought to be the endeavor of every true 
man. The child of colored parentage 
is born black; but to deny that boy or 
girl opportunity because of the color of 
his mother's or fathers skin is to inflict 
a cruel blight on one who is deserving 
of encouragement and is entitled to 
hope. The manhood test is the only fair 
one- No other standard is just. 

There are phases of the problem that 
are perplexing, but the only solution 
will be the just one. The colored man 
must overcome prejudice with manhood, 
industry and true refinement. What rep¬ 
resentatives of the race can do, the race 
can do. 1 hey should be given the 
chance. 


MR. S. S. SYKES. 

We had the pleasure of meeting Mr 
S. S. Sykes of Decatur, Ala., who is 
visiting his brother, Dr. M, E. 
Sykes of this city. Mr. Sykes is ac¬ 
companied by his two daughters, Misses 
Rebecca and Venicia, both handsome 


and accomplished young ladies. Mr. 
Sykes is making a success in the under¬ 
taking business in Decatur. Like the 
doctor, Mr. Sykes is a self-made man, 
both being left orphans in early child¬ 
hood and “growed up” while being 
thrown around as he puts it. While he 
is a leading business man in his city, the 
doctor stands at the head of his profes¬ 
sion in this. Without parents or home, 
thrown out upon the cold charity of the 
world, thev have fought their ways from 
ignorance and poverty to intelligence and 
affluence, from insignificant, homeless 
boys to strong, useful men. 

Mr. Sykes brings cheering news from 
our brethren in the mob-cursed South. 
He says each year witnesses greater 
strides and increased accumulations in 
intelligence and wealth and all other 
things necessary to the healthful growth 
of a people. "As the winds against the 
sails of a ship drive it into the desired 
haven, says he, so race discriminations 
have driven the Afro-Americans of the 
South into every avenue of business and 
professional life. "Mob law/’ he says, 
is the curse of all curses to which the 
colored people are subjected. The 
thought that one is to be put to death by 
a mob without trial if suspicioned of 
crime affects the colored people like 
showers . of salt water upon growing 
corn. Give every man in the South the 
protection of the law and the- strong, 
brave black men of that section will 
solve the race problem to the lasting 
credit of all concerned,” he said. 

Miss Venicia Sykes will make this 
city her home as a member of the doc¬ 
tor’s family for the future.

(From the Pasadena Daily Nczvs.) 

All the talk about transporting the 
colored people to various localities on 
this planet and others is useless. We 
might as well talk about transplanting 
all men under six feet in height to the 
moon. The Negro is here and has as 
good a right to be here as any white 
man has. Not only that, but he has as 
good right to open opportunity as any 
white man has/ If he commits crime, he 
ought to be judged iust as impartially as 
a white man. punched as severely, and 
no more so. His forefathers were 
brought here as slaves, and if any man

W. H. Bom gardener, of Scranton, 
Iowa, was awakened at 6 o’clock 
Thursday morning in his room, 225 
North Olive street, almost overcome 
by escaping .gas. With great difficulty 
he arose, and then fell on the floor, 
which immediately aroused the occu¬ 
pants, who came to his rescue by 
breaking down the door. His friend; 
W. L. Myers, of the Conservative 
Realty Company, was notified at once 
at the Severance building, as they dis¬ 
covered his card in the old gentleman’s 
pocket. Mr. Myers promptly attended 
to his wants, and the patient is re¬ 
ported doing nicely.
