Why 

A Big White Man Refused to 
Eat with Dr. Booker T. 
Washington in 
London. 

TUSKEGEE AND THE AMER¬ 
ICAN NEGRO 

Dr. Booker T. Washington’s In¬ 
dustrial Education Propaganda 
Dispassionately Reviewed in the 
Light of Actualities by an Am¬ 
erican Citizen. 

No. 4 Prince of Wales Terrace, 
Kensington, London, W., 

October 6, 1910. 

REV. J. H. HARRIS, SECRE¬ 
TARY, THE ANTI-SLAV¬ 
ERY AND ABORIGINES 
PROTECTION SOCIETY. 
Rev. Dear Sir: 

I must decline your Society’s 
kind invitation to the luncheon 
in honor of my fellow country¬ 
man, Dr. BookerT. Washington. 
1 do so with regret. Dr. Wash¬ 
ington, like myself, is a citizen of 
the United States. He is also a 
friend of many years. Our rela¬ 
tions have been cordial. More 
than once he has been my guest. 
The Sunday following his famous 
luncheon at the White House with 
President Roosevelt, when the 
consequent excitement—that exhi¬ 
bition of barbarism —was at its 
height, I gave a dinner in his 
honor at the leading hotel of New 
York. Not less than $50,000 was 
realized for his school on that oc¬ 
casion. At the time I also held his 
view on the Tuskegee propaganda. 
States Reason. 

From this you can perhaps in¬ 
fer that if your luncheon involved 
merely the personal equation, 1 
would gladly come, but it involves 
h great deal more, as you and your 
friends will all see within a short 
lime, and because it does, I deem 
it proper, out of regard for the 
host of the occasion, the noble or¬ 
ganization which you represent. 


that I should set forth briefly the 
reasons that compel me to decline 
an invitation from a Society that 
all good people delight to honor. 

Dr. Washington and his institu¬ 
tion at Tuskegee practically stand 
for the industrial education or ma¬ 
terial progress of the American 
Negro, and for that alone. 

Only Industrial Education. 

I do not. Neither do I stand for 
the industrial education of the 
Jews, the Irish, the Dutch, or any 
other race. It would be just as ra¬ 
tional to say that the men of Kent 
or Surrey shall all he wheelrights, 
every Welshman an electrician, 
every Scotchman a wardner, or 
that the young women of York¬ 
shire, even when qualified to go 
in for the Mathematical Tripos 
at Cambridge, shall all become 
Red Cross Nurses, as to lay down 
one course of study and develop¬ 
ment for 10,000,000 American cit¬ 
izens whose skins are colored, but 
who differ from one another in 
brain and body just as much as 
the people of other nations. 

Outrage Upon the Individual. 

More than a hundred years ago, 
when slavery flourished in the 
United States, North South, Alex¬ 
ander Hamilton, one of the great¬ 
est statesmen, keenest observers, 
and among the most logical rea- 
soners ever produced in America, 
declared, after exhaustive exami¬ 
nation, that the Negro’s “natural 
faculties are every hit as good as 
ours.” A century’s experience 
confirms this view, for even that 
ancient lie about certain “funda¬ 
mental differences in the brain 
^tmei^re.'’ has been so completely 
demolished in the cold processes 
of scientific demonstration, nota¬ 
bly by Professor Wilder, of Cor¬ 
nell, the French, German and oth¬ 
er savants, that we shall be trou¬ 
bled less with it in the future con¬ 
sideration of this subject. There 
are Negroes, and possibly the ma¬ 
jority of them, as in the case of 
th. whites, who may or may not 
be fit for higher education; but to 
say that the hundreds of thousands 
who unquestionably are shall be 
denied the cultivation of their fac¬ 


ulties is an outrage upon the indi¬ 
vidual and a crime against hu¬ 
manity. 

100 Years to Fit His Race for Bal¬ 
lot, Said Washington. 

Again, Dr. Washington stands 
for the inadequate education of 
his race, and tacitly accepts the 
shameful violation of the constitu¬ 
tional rights of the Afro-American. 
About 3,000 students of both 
sexes attend Tuskegee, and his 
theory seems to be that by a grad¬ 
ual multiplication of his school 
throughout the country the entire 
field will he covered in time. It 
certainly will require a very long 
time even to supply industrial edu¬ 
cation, but, as I heard him declare 
—and in doing so strikingly illus¬ 
trated Sir Harry Johnstone’ re¬ 
mark that NONE WERE MORE 
CALLOUS TO THE NEGRO’S 
SUFFERINGS THAN THE NE¬ 
GRO HIMSELF—in the Manhat¬ 
tan hotel. New York, that “a hun¬ 
dred years would he required to 
qualify his people for citizenship.” 
I suppose he feels more reconciled 
to this deliberate procedure than 
are the overwhelming majority of 
American citizens, whose repre¬ 
sentatives in Congress more than 
forty years ago wrote into our 
Constitution that fitness for citi¬ 
zenship was no longer to he con¬ 
ditioned upon “race, color or pre¬ 
vious conditions of servitude.” 1 
stand upon the Constitution which 
was amended in the Negro’s in¬ 
terest when, as an illiterate race, 
they had just emerged from sla¬ 
very, whereas now more than fifty 
per cent of them can read and 
write. 

National Aid to Education. 

The authorities estimate that 
more than four million children, 
about equally divided between 
white and colored, are growing up 
in the United States today with¬ 
out an opportunity to acquire even 
the rudiments of an education. It 
is part of slavery’s aftermath, as 
Mr. Archer realized in his recent 
journeyings through the South. 
Deplorable under any circum¬ 
stances, it is doubly so in this in¬ 
stance because it is absolutely un-

necessary. The United States, 
spending tens of millions for a new 
navy and hundreds of millions for 
a Panama Canal, is abundantly 
able to provide for the educational 
needs of every boy and girl be¬ 
neath the flag. It is able, and the 
great mass of our people are will¬ 
ing to do so. They were willing 
to do so twenty years ago, when 
that practical, comprehensive 
scheme of legislation known as 
the Blair Education Bill, put forth 
as an adequate expression of the 
popular desire, was passed again 
and again by the senate, and only 
beaten finally by one of the most 
discreditable combinations of po¬ 
litical selfishness, foolish leader¬ 
ship, misguided philanthropists 
and religious bigotry ever evi¬ 
denced at Washington. Had it 
passed, this bill would have elim¬ 
inated illiteracy completely from 
every Southern state, and given 
the Negro, as well as the white 
child, not only a primary educa¬ 
tion, but an enlightened environ¬ 
ment, within which lynching, mob 
law and color prejudice would 
gradually have become impossible. 

Promise of Adequate Education 
Not Fulfilled. 

Those who were responsible for 
the bill's defeat—and Dr. Wash¬ 
ington has some knowledge on this 
point—boasted that ample school 
facilities would be provided by the 
various states, supplemented with 
private philanthropy. The predic¬ 
tion has not been fulfilled. In one 
state, at least, the annual provision 
for popular education does not 
amount to a dollar a year, per cap¬ 
ita, and all the private enterprises 
the Peabod} 7 fund, Slater fund. 
Air. Carnegie’s and Air. Rockefel¬ 
ler’s large donaliC^s. Hampton, 
Risk, Nashville, Howard and 
Tuskegee, all roled together, are 
hut a drop in the bucket, and fail 
to do more than ripple the surface 
of this sea of ignorance. 
Education No Solution—Colored 

People 1 Prey of Mobs Despite 
♦ Schools. 

Not in their inadequacy, how¬ 
ever, lies the gravest objection to 


these attempts to substitute sps 
modic philanthropic enterprise for 
a stern, imperious Government 
duty. The argument rests upon 
deeper foundations. If popular 
education is, according to Burke, 
the bulwark of any nation, what 
sort of statecraft is it that would 
have this tower of strength de¬ 
pendent upon the humanitarian 
impulse of rich men and women, 
or the mendicancy of Dr. Wash¬ 
ington and others like him? Edu¬ 
cation is not to be sought or be¬ 
stowed asi a charity; it is nothing 
if not an inherent right of every 
American child, sanctioned by the 
overwheming majority of Amer¬ 
ican taxpayers, whose will has 
been thwarted by misguided peo¬ 
ple in magnifying the importance 
of their individual efforts to the 
detriment of the masses, and 
whose experiments, after a fair 
trial, extending over a quarter of 
a century, as a solution of the race 
problem, have been dismal fail¬ 
ures. Such individual institutions 
as Tuskogee have grown and pros¬ 
pered, but the social and political 
condition of the Negro in the 
South has become steadily worse, 
until to women like Mrs. Terrell 
and men like Dr. Du Bois it is to¬ 
day simply intolerable. The Ar¬ 
menian, under the old Turkish re¬ 
gime, was only at times more des¬ 
perate, for when the*mob's passion 
is aroused A NEGRO'S LIFE IS 
REGARDED WITH LESS 
CONCERN THAN THAT OF A 
DOG. 

Attempts to Make Europe Believe 
an Untruth. 

Please understand that T do not 
cleplore Tuskegee's prosperity. I 
rejoice that, thanks to Mr. Carne¬ 
gie and others. Dr. Wa-hington 
has been able to collect such large 
sums of money. He would he suc¬ 
cessful in any calling. A shrewd¬ 
er. a more adroit man would be 
difficult to find in Dixie. He has 
the genius of persuasion and diplo¬ 
macy. What I object to is his 
endeavor to make people here be¬ 
lieve an untruth, as he has done to 
an alarming extent in America, 
namelv, that his scheme of IN¬ 
DUSTRIAL EDUCATION TS A 


i-PANACEA, when he should know 
perfectly well that it is nothing of 
the kind. Industrial education 
was had by the Negro in slavery. 
They were the mechanics and ar¬ 
tisans of the South, as well as the 
tillers of the soil, and whatever 
may be said on behalf of the sys¬ 
tem, it surely will not be admitted 
by sane, thinking people that A 
MAN MUST ACQUIRE A 
TRADE AT THE PRICE OF 
HIS INDIVIDUAL OR POLI¬ 
TICAL MANHOOD. That is the 
crux of the situation. 

Negro Has Proved His Right to 
Ballot — Reconstruction 

Work Done. 

It has become fashionable 
among shallow thinkers and crude 
generalizes to say that the great 
statesmen of the Civil War, Sum¬ 
ner, Stevens, Fessenden, Wade, 
Conklin, Blaine and Shallabarger, 
with the aroused nation behind 
them, were mistaken in granting 
the Negro the right of suffrage. 
Nothing could be farther from the 
truth, and all the lying in connec¬ 
tion with the so-called “Carpet 
Bag” period cannot make it other¬ 
wise. The Negro has proved his 
right to citizenship. He has been 
right on every great question since 
the war. lie has voted intelli¬ 
gent!} 7 and with keen discrimina¬ 
tion; he left his imprint on the 
South by the wisest legislative 
measures in its history, among 
others the existing system of pub¬ 
lic schools, and when the history 
of the reconstruction period be¬ 
comes something more than an ac¬ 
cepted lie, the true story of Negro 
domination of the South will bring 
such a revision of opinion as to 
humiliate his traducers and con¬ 
found his adversaries. 

Every Race in Congress but the 
Colored. 

Some years ago I published a 
pamphlet, setting forth in detail 
the history of the Negro vote u> 
our ^national elections since the 
close of the Civil War, thereby de¬ 
monstrating that the Negro had 
voted in the Republic’s interest on 
every important issue, thus vindi¬ 
cating his judgment at the polls.

THE FALL ELECTIONS. 

The sweeping victory of 'the 
Democrats in the fall elections in 
the East was brought about to a 
large extent by the support 
given by the negro vote. The 
flocking of the thousand negro 
voters to the support of the Dem¬ 
ocratic ticket in New York. Ohio. 
Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jer¬ 
sey and other states, shows that 
the negro voters of today are not 
the negro voters of ten or twenty 
years ago. Unless the Republi¬ 
can party turns over a new leaf in 
its treatment of the colored vot¬ 
ers, and lives up to the spirit that 
brought it into existence, the end 
is not yet. If the Republican 
party, when in complete control 
of the government, can not* pro¬ 
tect the negro citizens in the en¬ 
joyment their constitutional 
rights, what does it matter with 


the negroes whether it is in or 
out of power. The Republican 
party will have to treat the negro 
fairly or lose his vote. That party 
has the machinery of the federal 
government in its hands and has 
had for more than twenty years 
during which time the negroes 
have been deprived of practically 
every constitutional right, and the 
party has not lifted one finger to 
prevent it. On the contrary, the 
party has condoned it by recog¬ 
nizing and encouraging Lily 
Whiteism. Under its beneficent 
control mob law has usurped the 
function of the court, peonage has 
flourished, taxation wtihout rep¬ 
resentation winked at, and Jim 
•Crowism upheld by its courts. 
Brownsville and Tafts negro pol¬ 
icy came to add insult to injury 
Remember Brownsville and 
Down with Lily Whiteism 

Will be the colored voters bat¬ 
tle cry at every coming election 
till justice is done. . The negro 
voters, abandoned in the South, 
are coming North to punish the 
Republican party for its perfidy. 
The way for the negro to secure 
the enjoyment of his constitu¬ 
tional rights is for him to vote 
against every man avIio fails to 
recognize those rigilts when in 
office, and to do so to the end 
of the chapter. In the future the 
negro voters will have to rally 
their forces around individuals, 
the individuals that give them a 
square deal, and concentrate 
against those who fail. After all. 
it is the votes in the ballot box 
that count. 

Brownsville has been partly 
avenged and “Lily Whiteism” 
has received a body blow. 

In the East the National Negro 
Independent League endorsed the 
Democratic ticket in every North¬ 
ern state save one. The Deal 
branch in this state endorsed the 
Lincoln - Roosevelt Republican 
wing,- as both stood for political 
freedom. Every Democratic state 
ticket that had the endorsement 
of the Negro Independent League 
won at the polls. 


DIRECT PRIMARIES EN¬ 
DORSED. 

The election of the Republican 
ticket in this state was not only 
an endorsement of the splendid 
men that won out at the prima¬ 
ries, but was an emphatic en¬ 
dorsement of the primary system. 
The attempt of the machine to 
defeat Governor-elect Johnson 
was an attempt to make the peo¬ 
ple discredit themselves. The 
fact that Governor-elect Johnson 
won with the machine vote 
thrown solidly against him, makes 
him absolutely independent of 
machine influences. The people 
have made him governor and 
given him a legislature in har¬ 
mony with his views in regard to 
all needed reforms. The reforms 
that made his election necessary 
enacted into laws, the rule of the 
people will be permanent. With 
the judiciary taken out of politics, 
the state and county clerkships 
put under civil service, and the 
Australian ballot restored to its 
original form, so to secure its ab¬ 
solute secrecy, the people will be 
enabled to rest secure in their 
right to govern themselves. The 
endorsement of candidates for 
United States senators by the peo¬ 
ple ought to be made effective. 


Elsewhere in the-e columns 
will be found the announcement 
of the Angelas Development Co. 
We are proud to sa} r that the 
company is in every way trust¬ 
worthy, and hope that the com¬ 
pany will receive the encourage¬ 
ment it deserves. 


THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
AND THE NEGRO VOTE. 

if the Democratic party will 
abandon its tradition of “doing 
the wrong thing at the right 
time.” and persuade its Southern 
wing to put an end to the agita¬ 
tion against the negro’s constitu¬ 
tional rights, the support given 
their ticket by the colored voters 
last November will mark the be¬ 
ginning of a political revolution.

and will vote for a change if the 
rabid negro-hating demagogues 
of that party are retired to private 
life. The agitation for the repeal 
of the War Amendments is the 
cheapest sort of subterfuge of in¬ 
competent office seekers. Com¬ 
munities that elect such men to 
office seriously reflect upon their 
own intelligence and show an ab¬ 
sence of the spirit of fair play that 
should characterize every Amer¬ 
ican community. There is no man 
living that will -ever see those 
amendments repealed, all agita¬ 
tion to the contrary notwithstand¬ 
ing. It will require a revolution 
to destroy those amendments. 
This the South does not want. If 
the South would turn her face to 
the future by erasing from her 
statutes all class legislative en¬ 
actments, she would at once take 
her rightful place in national af¬ 
fairs and the negro vote would be 
permanently divided, making the 
chances of Democratic success 
even with those of the Republi¬ 
cans. That would mean the send¬ 
ing of the best and most capable 
men, both North and South, to the 
halls of Congress. Let the South 
put a stop to the senseless agita¬ 
tion against the negro's rights 
and he will help her brilliant sons 
gratify their laudable ambitions. 

The negro has no grievance 
against the northern wing of the 
Democratic party, as it has gener¬ 
ally recognized his rights when in 
power and has given him as great 
political recognition as his sup¬ 
port warranted. 


Continued from Page 3 

That pamphlet has been circulated 
widely, but not a single statement 
in it has ever been challenged. In 
other words, the Negroes have 
proved themselves as worthy of 
citizenship as any other element 
of our population, and yet, not¬ 
withstanding this, they are today 
without a single representative' in 
Congress, the Courts, the Cabinet, 
or practically in any of the state 
legislatures, something that can¬ 
not be said of any other body of 
American citizens. The German- 


Americans are no more numerous, 
but you find few municipal or 
state governments in which they 
are not represented in accordance 
with their numerical strength in 
the electorate; their spokesmen 
ure conspicuous in the halls of na¬ 
tional legislation. The same is 
true of the Swedes, the Hunga- 
lians, the Italians, and, of course, 
conspicuously true of the Irish. 
The Indians have a United States 
Senator. The Jews are repre- 
. ented even in the cabinet, and no 
sensible man thinks it should be 
otherwise. The Negro is ex¬ 
cluded, not because of any per¬ 
sonal unfitness (his representa¬ 
tives were always among the 
ablest in Congress), but for no 
other reason than that of his col¬ 
or and race. 

Color Disfranchisement Con¬ 
demned as Fraudulent— 
Disgraceful. 

H.e is a victim of shameless 
class legislation, of force, fraud, 
intimidation and murder. No 
fair-minded man familiar with the 
way in which the disfranchising 
of the colored voter was brought 
about in the Southern states has 
any question whatever as to the 
wholesale fraudulent character of 
the entire procedure. It was con¬ 
trary to the letter of the Constitu¬ 
tion. It is in clear violation of the 
solemn pledges of the seceding 
states when they were re-admitted 
to the Union. It is an outrage on 
our American citizenship, a dis¬ 
grace to Republican Govern¬ 
ment, an affront to advancing ci¬ 
vilization. 

The Case against Washington— 

Untrue to Own Race—Los¬ 
ing Friends. 

To sum up. Dr. Washington 
s lands for private, spasmodic 
schemes of education based upon 
private charity; condones the' dis¬ 
franchisement of the Negro, in 
fact if not in form, negatively if 
not positively: deems it unwise to 
denounce lynching or peonage, or 
protest against the numberless 
shameless outrages perpetrated 
upon his race throughout the 
country. He thinks he can do 


more by overlooking them and by 
persuading everybody else he can 
to overlook them also. He has 
been tolerably successful up to the 
present time, but he has reached 
the limit. His staunchest uphold¬ 
ers in America, such, for example, 
as The Evening Post of New 
York, Avhich was foolishly led to 
oppose the Blair Education Bill 
years ago, has at last become 
aroused to the absurdity of the 
Tuskegee proposition as the sal¬ 
vation of the Negro, typifying in 
this the beclouded brain clearing 
and long dormant conscience awa¬ 
kening of the nation. 
Washington’s Misrepresentations. 

The lynching habit has grown 
in America until the average dur¬ 
ing the past few months has 
reached one a day, or about double 
that which has prevailed during 
the last tAventy years. Sixty men 
were massacred in Texas in July 
without any Government iiwesti- 
gation or inquiry, and yet Dr 
Washington comes over here and 
blandly assures the British public 
that the races are dwelling to¬ 
gether more amicably than in the 
past. He is utterly mistaken, and 
in refutation of what he says, I 
offer you this unchallenged state¬ 
ment, made in the United States 
Senate by one of the most Avidely- 
known of that body, a Southerner 
of Southerners, Senator Tillman, 
of South Carolina, who in a speech 
delivered before the Senate openly 
declared : 

“Race hatred grows day by day. 
There is no man who is honest, 
going through the South and con¬ 
versing with the white people and 
blacks, but will return and tell 
you this is true. Then 1 say to 
you of the North who are the rul¬ 
ers of the land, who can change 
this or do something to relieve 
conditions, what are you going to 
do about it? Are you going to sit 
quiet? If nothing else will cause 
you to think, 1 notify you Avhat 
you alreacl)- know, that there are 
a billion dollars or more of North¬ 
ern capital invested in the South 
in railroads, in mines, in forests, 
in farm lands, and self interest, 

















6 

which fact, if nothing else, ought 
to make you set about hunting 
some remedy for this terrible situ¬ 
ation. As it is, the South is help¬ 
less. We can do nothing. We are 
one-third of the population. You 
are two-thirds. Every year your 
numbers are being added to by a 
million immigrants in the North, 
who stay there, while none go to 
us. The million who came in last 
year represent five Congressmen. 
Those who came in year before 
last represent five more Congress¬ 
men. There is no danger of poli¬ 
tical power ever drifting away 
from the North. Therefore we say 
to you, it is your duty to do some¬ 
thing. it is your duty to move. It 
is your duty to begin the discus¬ 
sion. For the time being the 
South is occupying an attitude of 
constant friction, race riot, butch¬ 
ery, murder of whites by blacks 
and blacks by whites, the inevit¬ 
able, irrepressible conflict/' 

Thanking you again for your 
kind invitation, wishing your soci¬ 
ety all prosperity, and your guest 
health of body and a clearer vision 
1 beg to remain, 

Yours sincerely,

Some of the leading men of our 
race are really together for once 
on a business proposition. The 
Angelus Development Company, 
incorporated under the laws of 
the territory of Arizona, with a 
capital stock of $7,1,000 fully paid 
and lion-assessable, is now ready 
to do business. The directors 
are such men as Harry Mitchell, 
Rev. F. T. Peck, J. T. Hill, ]. \V. 
Wilson, Wm. Speight, L. M. Ha- 
good, J. L. McCoy, C. H. An¬ 
derson, M. W. Lewis, Frederick 
Roberts, T. A. Coles, Geo. Cald¬ 
well, E. A. Akers and W. L. Kim¬ 
brough, will assure the public that 
the company is sound, solid and 
businesslike. 

A beautiful beach resort joining 
Flava del Rev has been purchased 
and the company plans to have 
buildings and equipment in readi¬ 


THE LIBERATOR 

ness for the heavy picnic season 
of tlie coming summer. Shares 
are selling at present for one dol¬ 
lar each. This will last for only^a 
short time, for as soon as im¬ 
provements begin the price of 
stock will of necessity be in¬ 
creased. Hence, see to it that you 
get in on the ground floor. The 
directors are anxious to have ev¬ 
ery citizen of color buy shares 
and become a part of this great 
business enterprise. There will 
be no agents going the rounds 
with little grip satchels peddling 
stock for a small percentage, but 
our office on the fourth floor of the 
San Fernando Building is open 
to all desiring information. If 
you cannot afford the time to 
have a personal talk with the 
president, H. M. Mitchell, just 
call lip Main 4525 and ask for the 
Angelus Development Co. and 
all information will be given you. 
The company feels complimented 
at meeting with the success that 
has already come to them, in that 
they have one of the finest sum¬ 
mer resorts to be found anywhere 
on the beach, when buildings, 
etc., are complete. 

In the light of racial conditions 
our people need some place of 
their own, rid 'of present embar- 
assments, where they can take' a 
plunge into the ocean and not he 
compelled to walk six or eight 
blocks to the house of some friend 
to change clothing. We feel that 
the people at large will hail with 
joy this great step in advance and 
keep a steady tramp towards 
Fourth and Main streets to the 
office of Mitchell & Lewis on the 
fourth floor of the San Fernando 
building, and buy the stock while/ 
it is cheap.

President.

COLORED MEN MAKING 

GOOD SHOWING 

As Seen on Our Recent Trip to 
San Francisco and Oakland. 

On a recent trip through the 
San Joaquin valley, San Francisco 


and Oakland were visited. At 
San Francisco Mr. Francis, the 
genial and popular editor of the 
Outlook, extended us every possi¬ 
ble courtesy. Mr. Francis added 
to the profit of our visit by pre- 
, senting us much valuable data, for 
which we are sincerely grateful 

Mr. Mad docks, who holds a 
very important position with the 
Southern Pacific, was out looking 
after the printing of the com¬ 
pany’s new time table. The re¬ 
arrangement of the schedule is a 
position requiring great care and 
skill. 

Mr. Francis had just reached 
home from his lour of Southern 
California extending over several 
weeks; so we found him quite 
busy straightening out matters. 
He was greatly pleased with 
Southern California, and the peo¬ 
ple of the South think him one of 
the most popular newspaper men 
within the state. 

Nothing connected with our trip 
gave us greater pleasure than 
our visit to the home of Rev. C. 
W. H. (Daddy) Nelson and wife 
We found Mrs. Nelson busy mak¬ 
ing a fur hat. In spite of the fact 
that ‘'Daddie'’ NeFon had been 
sick for several days, lie insisted 
on getting up and preparing us 
dinner, which was one of the best 
we ever ate. Rev. Mr. Nelson and 
the editor played together when 
boys in the far-away village of 
Crawford, Miss., in the days of 
long ago. And the good men and 
women who kindly guided our 
youthful footsteps in those golden 
days of youth Time, like a huge 
billow, has wafted to the farther 
shore. Rev. Mr. Nelson is pastor 
of the A. M. E. Church and is suc¬ 
ceeding nicely. lie was long a 
resident of this city, where he and 
Mrs. Nelson are universally loved 
for their Chrisitan characters. Dr. 
T. J. Nelson, their son, is one of 
the leading physicians of this city. 
He was reared here and is dcs..rv- 
ingly popular. 

Oakland. 

On the afternoon of Nov. *Md. 
we crossed the bar and had a 
pleasant stay in the city of Oak- 
























THE LIBERATOR 


V 


land. On reaching the city we 
went directly to the realty and 
employment office of our old 
friend and former fellow towns¬ 
man, Mr. O. Hudson, 855 Broad¬ 
way. We took the old boy by 
surprise by dropping in his office 
unannounced. Mr. Hudson not 
only does a profitable employ¬ 
ment business, but his realty and 
loan department is well patron¬ 
ized. Mr. Hudson’s business is 
a valuable asset to the colored 
people of the bay city, owing to 
the fact that through it they can 
secure desirable homes, negotiate 
loans and find ready employment. 
He has taken up the study of law 
and hopes soon to be admitted to 
the bar. Mr. Hudson’s office is 
a neat, well-kept, busy place, re¬ 
quiring a stenographer and type¬ 
writer. 

Although quite busy, he laid 
things aside and kindly showed 
us about the city. The thing that 
interested 11 s most was the energy 
shown by our people along busi¬ 
ness lines. A large portion of 
Seventh street is occupied by col¬ 
ored business men and women, 
who are engaged in nearly every 
line of business. Our first stop 
was at the Vance & Dedrick Cafe. 
This is the largest, finest and 
most complete establishment of 
its kind in the West run by col¬ 
ored men. 

Moody’s little dairy cafe is also 
a well-kept, up-to-date establish¬ 
ment. 

Mr. H. W. Jones carries a large 
stock of men’s furnishings in con¬ 
nection with an up-to-date clean¬ 
ing and dyeing establishment. 
The colored barber shops are un¬ 
surpassed for neatness and mod¬ 
ern conveniences. There are 
many other places of business we 
would like to mention, but space 
will not permit. 

We paid a pleasant call at the 
Sunshine office, where we found 
the editor busy with his large 
stock of furniture. Besides his 
newspaper business he manages 
a large furniture establishment 
which pays better perhaps than 


all of the negro newspapers in the 
state. 

We left Oakland highly grati¬ 
fied with the showing our people 
are making in business. We 
reached Fresno on our down trip 
on Thanksgiving Day and enjoyed 
a splendid luncheon with Rev. J. 
W. Price of the A. M. E. church, 
We were pleased to meet two new 
families there, one from Mississ¬ 
ippi and one from Louisiana, who 
had settled in the valley since our 
visit there in September. 

The virtues of the San Joaquin 
Valley as a desirable location for 
building independent homes are 
becoming known among the col¬ 
ored people throughout the Soufli 
and they will not be slow to seize 
the opportunities offered there 
while they are at the door. On 
account of sickness, our stay in 
the valley, which we had planned 
to occupy a week of investigation 
was cut short. We will, however 
pay them a visit in the near fu¬ 
ture. 

By the way, one of the most 
interesting persons we met on our 
trip North was Mr. George W. 
Dennis, the most popular man at 
the Ferry Building, San .Fran¬ 
cisco. He kindly showed us about 
the building, making it exceed¬ 
ingly pleasant for us. 


MR. MILTON LEWIS 

A BENEDICT 

Mr. Milton W. Lewis, of the 
well-known real estate firm of 
Mitchell & Lewis, was married 
recently to Mrs. Kennedy. The 
honeymoon was spent in San

couple its best wishes. They will

MR. J. W. COLEMAN

doing more real good for his race 
Ilian any on? man in the state of 
California. His good judgment 
and careful selection has enabled 
him to successfully place over 
eight thousand five hundred (col¬ 


ored) men and women in good po¬ 
sitions throughout the state and 
elsewhere. He has, by supplying 
the best class of help, raised the 
standard of wages for his people, 
until now he commands the pa¬ 
tronage and influence of those who 
know the value of good service. 
Consequently, those who want col¬ 
ored help, naturally will place 
their orders with him. So you will 
save time, worry, expense and dis¬ 
appointment by calling at his of¬ 
fice. Remember he solicits the 
patronage of reliable help only.
