OPPORTUNITIES IN THE IMPERIAL 

VALLEY 


The opportunities offered colored 
men to acquire homes in the Im¬ 
perial valley are without parallel. 
All a man needs is a desire to 
have something, coupled with a 
willingness to work. Land is 
cheap and wages are high. Farm 
laborers receive from $2 to $2,50 
per day; women, $20 to $30 per 
month; cotton pickers receive $1.00 
per hundred for picking cotton. 
Last season a woman and her 
three girls earned $11 per day pick¬ 
ing cotton; there are many instances 
of the kind among the cotton pick¬ 
ers. 


Anybody Can Own .a Home. 

The land is cheap and sold on 
terms so easy that any man or 
woman desiring it, can own a 
home and become independent. 
20 acres of land can be purchased 
for from $1500 to $2500, a small 
cash payment down and the bal¬ 
ance in three to five years. The 
land is in a high state of cultiva¬ 
tion with an abundant supply of 
water. The soil, which is a hun¬ 
dred feet deep, is the richest on 
earth. One man can cultivate 40 
acres of cotton which is sure to 
produce from 40 to 50 bales. 

The Imperial Valley produces 
the finest long staple cotton on 
earth and will have to furnish the 
world’s supply. The Agricultural 
Department at Washington is urg¬ 
ing the Imperial farmers to plant 
only long staple cotton where 
possible, so that seeds can be pro¬ 
duced in sufficient quantities to 


stop the cultivation of short staple 
cotton. 


Plenty of Land for Homeseekers. 

There is land enough in the val¬ 
ley to support a population of two 
millions. The people of the val¬ 
ley are anxious to have colored 
cotton farmers come in, buy the 
land and develop the cotton in¬ 
dustry which is bound to make 
millions for the producers who 
own the soil. 

For the over-worked, poorly- 
paid cotton farmers of the South, 
the Imperial Valley offers oppor¬ 
tunities nowhere else to be had. 
While wages are twice as high as 
those paid in the South, the cost 
of living is no higher. In the South 
the cotton farmer works twelve 
to fourteen hours per day; hern 
they work ten to twelve hours. 

Every colored farmer who goes 
to the valley and buys a farm, 
will find ready employment at 
$2.25 per day on adjoining farms 
for all of his spare time. 

Opportunities Will Not Last. 

If colored farmers would take 
advantage of the opportunities 
offered them in the Imperial Val¬ 
ley, there is no time to lose. When 
the Panama canal is completed, 
millions of foreigners will come in 
and possess these rich lands and 
not only double the prices but take 
them permanently off the market. 

Every neighborhood has its 
grammar school with nine-month 


terms where each child can be 
properly educated.

LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY IS NOW 
GROWING RAPIDLY 

El Centro, May 7.—That the 
livestock industry in the Imperial 
Valley is growing is shown by the 
fact that there are now about 200,- 
000 head in the irrigated area be- 
between Brawley on the north 
and Calexico on the south. About 
one-half of this number are sheep. 
In round numbers, there are 20,000 
beef cattle, 15,000 dairy cows, 
50,000 hogs and 15,000 horses and 
mules in the valley. 

The alfalfa acreage is steadily 
increasing to keep pace with the 
growth of the stock-raising indus¬ 
try. For this reason, and because 
of the prevailing high price of 
feed, the farmers are making pre¬ 
parations for plating more corn 
this summer than ever before. 


DR. LOCKE PLEADS FOR NE¬ 
GRO BISHOPS 

Dr. Charles Edward Locke, pas¬ 
tor of our Firsj; Church at Los 
Angeles, California, uttered a 
strong word in favor of the elec¬ 
tion of a Negro to the Episcopacy 
in a recent address before the 
preacher’s meeting of his home 
city. 

“Shall a colored Bishop be elected 
for the colored Conferences? Yes. 
Since there are twenty Annual 























































TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


Negro Conferences, with 2000 pas¬ 
tors, and over 350,000 colored 
members; I believe, if the Negroes 
have leaders providentially selected, 
that the time has come to elect 
one, perhaps two, Negro Bishops 
who shall administer the affairs 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
among our Negro members. They 
should be full Bishops, and just 
as Negro preachers are made full 
elders, and serve people of their 
own race, so a full Negro Bishop 
would preside over Negro Confer¬ 
ences. As a cultured man of their 
own number says: ‘Everything else 
being equal, black lips for black 
ears is decidedly preferable/ There 
are natural racial boundaries and 
black people are no more anxious 
to belong to white churches, and 
black preachers to minister over 
white parishes, and black Bishops 
to preside over white Conferences, 
than the white people hesitate to 
have them do it. The Negro is 
working out his own salvation. 
He should have every encourage¬ 
ment and in the end his personality 
will be acknowledged, and he will 
ask favors from no one but God.” 

Continuing Dr. Locke said: 

“Shall there be a union of all 
Methodist denominations: Yes, 
but let it not be precipitated, and 
let none of our Heaven-inspired 
ideals be sacrificed even to bring 
about church union. 

When asked afterward what he 
had in mind when he made this 
statement, Dr. Locke said that 
he had the colored membership 
on his heart and that he would not 
be in favor of any union of Metho¬ 
dist denominations which required 
us to notify our colored membership 
to organize a church of their own.

FURLONG FORGING TO THE 
FRONT. UP-TO-DATE BUS¬ 
INESS HOUSES 


A visit to Furlong is one, that 
is to us, always full of pleasant 
anticipations. So, last Saturday, 
we decided to spend the afternoon 
visiting our family of subscribers 
and their friends residing in that 
charming little city within the 
city. 

Taking the Watts local we found 
our genial friend, Hon. Theodore 
W. Jones, accompanied by a real 
estate man, extolling the virtue 
of his holdings. 

Alighting from the car at 55th 
street, the western limit of Fur¬ 
long, we found ourselves at the 
grocery and baking establishment 
owned and conducted by Kinard 
& Thompson. This is one of the 
neatest, best kept establishments 
in this city. Their stock of gro¬ 
ceries is complete and everything 
arranged in the most attractive 
manner. The bakery is just as 
neat and clean as the grocery. 
Large show cases protected the 
bread, cakes and pies from flies 
and dust. This adds to the whole¬ 
someness of the already appetiz¬ 
ing wares. The Tuskegee idea of 
cleanliness is here carried out to a 
dot. 

There are a number of colored 
grocers in the city whose bread 
sales run into hundreds of dollars, 
who would, doubtless, greatly in¬ 
crease their business by using Kin¬ 
ard & Thompson’s bread, cakes 
and pies, as there are none better 
or fresher. His bread for size 
and sweetness cannot be beat. 

Mr. Thompson owns the prop¬ 
erty which consists of three lots 
and a two-story brick building. 

Mr. Thompson is the former head 
of the publicity department at 
Tuskegee and assistant to the 
treasurer. 


Attractive Homes. 

Furlong is two blocks deep, 
running from 50th to 55th streets, 
inclusive; has two churches, a 
splendid grammar school and three 


business houses. In no section 
of the city is there more improve¬ 
ments going on than is to be found 
in this little city. On every street, 
in every block, new residences are 
being erected and enlarged. Old 
pioneer shacks are fast disappear¬ 
ing, modern cottages taking their 
places. This is a good sign from 
many view points. Every foot 
of land is being utilized; either 
flowers greet you with a smile or 
vegetables with a laugh; nothing 
is idle; everything contributing its 
share to the general good cheer. 

Now that the citizens of Furlong 
are getting out of debt, they can 
put their city on a solid founda¬ 
tion by purchasing country pro¬ 
perty while it is still within their 
reach. Every big business man 
in the city owns one or more ranches. 

The farm is the source of all 
wealth. The people who own the 
farms own everything. 


The discovery that the places 
held by the nurses at the County 
Hospital can all be filled on short 
notice, has cleared up the atmo¬ 
sphere. The majority of the em¬ 
ployees out there are people whose 
intelligence is such that they will 
do just as told to do by those in 
authority; and,‘have no idea of 
handing in their resignations, un¬ 
less they are demanded. 


LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE 


Los Angeles, Cal., April 8, 1912 
Mr. J. L. Edmonds, 

Sawtelle, Cal., 

Dear Friend: 

I’m glad to see you take the 
proper stand against Roosevelt; 
likewise our own Supervisors. But 
I should not expect anything else 
from a man who always espouses 
the cause of the Negro. 

. You have my best wishes for 
prosperity and long life that you 
may continue to pour hot shot 
into the enemy. 

Yours for the race, 

A. C. GARROTT.

The Negro can stand any amount

THE MINISTER’S FEDERATION - 

LIBELLED 

Three years ago, when a campaign 
was on to decide whether this city 
should be a closed or open town, 
Rev. Peck, candidate for bishop, 
thought that an open town would 
suit him best and fought to “keep 
her open.” This is a matter of 
record. The publication of this 
record, some time ago, by this 
journal, has deranged one preach¬ 
er’s mind. He declares that it 
is a sin against the Holy Ghost 
to publish a minister’s political 
record. “It is an attack on God’s 
annointed.” 

Good Heavens! What next!! 


THE MINISTER’S FEDERATION 
ENDORSES THE LIBERATOR 


At its meeting on April 30th, 
the Minister’s Federation after a 
brief discussion of the article ap¬ 
pearing in this journal recently, 
relating to Rev. Peck’s political 
record, refused to condemn The 
Liberator or re-affirm its endorse¬ 
ment of Rev. Peck. This action 
was based upon the fact that 
The Liberator’s statements were 
true and that this journal had 
acted wholly within its province 
and therefore was guilty of no 
wrong. 

It was also the consensus of 
opinion, that Rev. Peck’s interest 
could best be served by ignoring 
the whole matter. When a man 
is over a barrel, his friends ought 
not start it to rolling. 

The Federation is composed very 
largely of cultured gentlemen 
who fully understand their rela¬ 
tion and duty to the public. The 
Federation, of course, has among 
its members men whom prosperity 
has made top-heavy; others who 
are using their membership to 
hold up the public. The Federa¬ 
tion is a sane body, which knows 
that 'a public man’s record is 
public property and that it is not 
yet a crime to discuss it in a news¬ 
paper. The Federation knows also 
that the people’s estimate of a 
minister is what he is. 


“Rev. J. F. Peck, D. D., a colored 
preacher of this city, is a candidate 
for the bishopric before the general 
conference of the African Metho¬ 
dist Episcopal Church, now in 
session at Kansas City. He has 
been endorsed by the Federation 
of Colored Ministers of all denomi¬ 
nations, of the city and county 
of Los Angeles. When an attack 
was made upon him in The Lib¬ 
erator, a paper published in this 
city by a colored man, the Federa¬ 
tion, by the unanimous vote of the 
thirty ministers present, re-affirmed
