“Teddy” Roosevelt couldn’t get the 
colored vote as, candidate for dog 
etcher. If be runs again be hope f 
to get the Southern vote, but no man 
if his kind can ever win the voting 
South’s confidence. To get the South¬ 
ern vote, Daniel Webster betrayed the 
cause of freedom as Teddy has the 
negroes. 


HON. EDWARD L. HUTCHISON. 

Candidate for Councilman from the 
Eighth ward, is so well known that 
he needs no introduction. His serv¬ 
ices to that ward as Councilman are 
fresh in the minds of the voters, and 
his election is almost certain. He is 
a broad, progressive young man, well 
acquainted with the needs of this 
great and growing municipality. In 
this contest Mr. Hutchison will have 
the united support of the colored vot¬ 
ers. they being thoroughly disgusted 
with “stinkout” Healy and his kind of 
Remiblicans. We trust that every col¬ 
ored voter in that ward will turn out 
December 4th and devote one day to 
the undoing of “stinkout” Healy and 
the election of Hon. Edward L. Hut¬ 
chison. 


MR. HARPER WILL GET THE COLORED VO^F-. 


The colored votes of this city will be cast for Hon. Arthur C. Harper 
because they want a square deal in the.public service. And they know that 
their only assurance of getting a square deal depends upon the election of 
Mr. Harper, Every colored man in the service of the city today owes his 
appointment to ex-Mayor M. P. Snyder, a Southern Democrat, and Mr. 
Snyder was backed by the Hon. A. C. Harper from start to finish. Remove 
from the public service today the colored men who owe their appointments 
to Democratic influence and you have nothing left. Who made Randolph, 
Glen and Stevens policemen? Go to the fire department and ask our stalwart 
young men who put them there—Snyder, Snyder! will be the cheerful 
shout. Go to the street department and the parks and ask our men how 
came they there. When Rev. C. H. Anderson’s son was dismissed from the 
fire department on the Rooseveltian plan, who restored him to his place? 
M. P. Snyder, the Democrat who had Harper’s backing. M'here are the 
colored men appointed by Fred Eaton when he was mayor? He was a Re¬ 
publican and ran on the record of the saintly Lincoln, having nothing else 
to run on. He promised the colored voters everything, but when elected 
not onlv gave them nothing, hut took from them every job they held that 
he could get hold of. Where are Eaton’s colored appointees? Echo answers 
“where?” Trot out your colored men appointed by the present Republican 
mayor, the Hon. Owen McAleer. He also ran on Lincoln’s record. 

JUDGE THE TREE BY THE FRUIT-IT BEARS, 


*ays that grand old book of books. Judged by that holy standard, how many 
intelligent colored voters could cast their votes for the Republican city 
tickets That’s whv the three or four hirelings that have sold the Afro- 
American council to Dr. Lindley are out in a circular asking the colored 
voters to support the Republican ticket, because Lincoln was a Republican. 
The use of Lincoln’s name by such a vile gang is not only an insult to 
humanity’s saintly dead, but an insult to every intelligent race-loving negro 
m the city. Instead of kicking honorable negro soldiers out of the army, 
without honor and pay for long and honorable service to the country, Lincoln 
threw wide the door of the army to every patriotic ne.jro who was willing 

to defend the flag. _ . , 

In this city campaign Lincoln is not running for mayor, e won 
accept a nomination from the gang that is disgracing tie grand old party, 
lhat has long since been killed by renegades like Roosevs It and negro-hating 
office-seekers. The colored voters will vote for Hon. A. C. Harper because 
his election means a business administration m which all citizen, will be 
treated alike in the distribution of public patronage. The colored voters 
want a square deal and will help to elect Mr. Harper mayor so as to make 




NEGROES ARE NOT FOOLS. 

Have the Republicans of this city given the negroes a square deal? If 
not. why not? How many clerkships have they given the negroes in the 
City Hall’ What positions have they given the negroes in recognition o 
rheir slavish support of the party? The negro voters are entitled to at least 
r W0 permanent clerkships in the City Hall. Have they got them? Why not 
Why haven’t the negroes been given permanent clerkships at the coui - 
house’ Under the rule of the Republicans at the court-house and City Hail, 
what have the colored voters got anyway? The negroes are not tools. They 
1 :now that there is no politics in local city elections; the question is one ot 
men and fitness. The question with the colored voter Is, which of the 
candidates will give them the greatest recognition after the election If the 
fire is to be fudged by the past, Harper is the man. The ballot of every 
colored voter who wants a square deal must read 

For Mayor— ARTHUR C. HARPER. (X)

THEIR RACE PROVIDES HELP FOR 
ALL DISCHARGED. 

Three Companies Will Be Taken to 
Chicago, Philadelphia and New York 
for Exhibition—Mass Meeting Is 
Called and President Will Be Urged 
to Reopen Case. 

San Antonio, Tex., Nov. 22.—Early 
this morning at Fort Sam Houston, the 
negro soldiers who are charged by 
the people of Brownsville with murder 
and rioting, were dismissed f-rom the 
service by Col. George Leroy, com¬ 
manding the post. 

The negroes immediately left the 
reservation, avoiding curious little 
groups of early visitors who were 
watching the proceedings. 

Assistance Is Offered. 

New York, Nov. 22.—The three 
companies of negro troops discharged 
from the United States army by order 
of President Roosevelt will be taken 
to Chicago, Philadelphia and New 
York, according to a plan announced 
here today. The movement is said to 
have been started by the citizens of 
the three cities. 

According to this plan the former 
soldiers will be clothed and cared for 
by the committees and employment 
eventually found, and plans have been 
made so that any person who is inter¬ 
ested in the case and who desires to 
hear the soldiers’ side of the story 
will have access to the men. At pres¬ 
ent the soldiers are at Fort Reno. 

The negro pastors and other leaders 
of their race here have determined to 
hold a mass meeting at Cooper Union 
on December 1, at which distinguished 
white and colored men are to speak. 
A large delegation of ministers, with 
lawyers who have been retained on be¬ 
half of the negro soldiers, is to visit 
President Roosevelt on Monday at 
Washington and urge him to reopen 
the case. 


Councilman Healy Builds a Privy at 
Rev. J. L. Trimble’s Door. 

Of all methods adopted by negro- 
hating white folks to drive negroes 
out of a community, the one adopted 
by Councilman Healy, Republican can¬ 
didate for re-election from the Eighth 
ward, promises to be quite a success. 
Rev. Trimble is an intelligent indus¬ 
trious, law abiding citizen of the 
Eighth ward, owning his own borne, 
which happens to be near that of Coun’ 
oilman Healy. Now Mr. Healy is 9 
good Republican, but has no use for 
the negro after getting his vote. Rev. 
Trimble, who had been voting for 
Healy, made the mistake of becoming 
Healy’s neighbor—bought the next 
door cottage. Healy hit upon the novel 
plan to stinking his colored neighbor 
and respectable minister out. Select¬ 
ing a spot on his line right in front 
of Rev. Trimble’s door, Healy built his 
privy. Coupled with the stink and dis¬ 
agreeable noise that eminates from 
the place when it is inhabited, it makes 


the lives of the inmates of the Trimble 
home anything but a glad, sweet song 
Rev. Trimble apealed for relief to the 
City Council and Board of Health, but 
these departments, like Healy, are Re¬ 
publican. 

What Trimble should do now is to 
aid in bringing about Healy's defeat. 

Hon. Edward L. Hutchison, Healy’s 
opponent, is a gentleman too nigh 
tone to stoop to such a measly, dirty 
trick. A man like Heajy is too small 
to sit in the council of a great city 
like Los Angeles. Fall in behind 
Hutchison and make the defeat of 
“stink-out” Healy the battle-cry 


A Negro on the Chicago Bench. 

Ferdinand L. Barnett is a Negro 
lawyer of Chicago. He has served ac¬ 
ceptably several years as an assistant 
State’s attorney. At the recent elec¬ 
tion he stood as a Republican candi¬ 
date for a municipal court judgeship, 
and no question of his integrity was 
raised. But his name was scratched 
by thousands of Republican voters. 
He came near failing of election, but 
he was elected. And then from the 
newspapers of his own party there 
arose a demand upon him for his 
resignation—not for unfitness, but be¬ 
cause he is a Negro. He had been 
nominated in order to hold the Negro 
vote for Republican white men; but 
his party did not intend that he him¬ 
self should be elected. They wanted 
the Negro vote, but they did not want 
a Negro judge. They had calculated 
that he would run behind his ticket 
and be defeated; and so he would have 
been but for the Independence League. 
This took away from the Democrats 
so many votes that Mr. Barnett, al¬ 
though far behind in the Republican 
column in consequence of Republican 
antipathy to the Negro, was neverthe¬ 
less ahead of the strongest Democrat. 
And now the Republican leaders of 
Chicago are so much embarrassed that 
they urge Mr. Barnett to resign. Why? 
There is no reason for it except race 
prejudice.—The Public (white). 


Three Afro-Americans Elected. 

Chicago, Ill. At the recent election 
Mr. Oscar DePriest was re-elected 
county commissioner, Dr. Alexander 
Lane was elected a member of the 
legislature, and F. L. Barnett, Esq., 
assistant state’s attorney, was elect¬ 
ed a municipal judge for two years 
Mr. Barnett said a few days ago: 

When, after the cases are assigned, 
I find that anybody has a distinct 
prejudice agains - being tried by- a 
Negro I shall grant him a change of 
venue,” he said. It merely is a 
question of race prejudice, and I 
don’t blame anybody for such feelings 
as I don’t suppose that they can help 
them. I do not believe, however, that 
such feelings should interfere with me 
m the discharge of my duties. A negro 
or a white person will get justice in 
my court the same as he would else¬ 
where.” 


MR. M. T. COLLINS, 

Non-partisan candidate for Council 
from the Ninth Ward, is a friend of 
the colored people and merits their 
support. Two years ago, while con¬ 
ducting Mr. Handley’s campaign, he 
pledged the colored people in the 
event of his (Handley’s) election they 
would have representation. That 
pledge was kept and sixteen colored 
men were given places in the street 
department. Mr. Collins has served 
the city as councilman, police com¬ 
missioner and on the board of health. 
There being no politics in the present 
city election the colored voters will 
scan their tickets and vote only for 
their friends. Mr. Collins has proven 
himself to be one of them. Vote for 
him. 


DEMOCRATIC CITY TICKET. 

Mayor—A. C. Harper. 

City Clerk—H. J. Lelande. 

City Attorney—Leslie Hewitt. 

City Treasurer—C. H. Hance. 

City Tax Collector—John H. Welsh. 
City Assessor—Walter Mallard. 

City Auditor—W. C. Mushet. 



Mr. Henry Lyons, Republican Candi¬ 
date for Councilman From the 
Seventh Ward. 

Mr. Henry Lyons, Republican can¬ 
didate for councilman from the Sev¬ 
enth ward, is well known and popular 
with the colored voters. It is an as¬ 
sured fact that Mr. Lyons will have 
the united support of the colored vot¬ 
ers because they know that tlieir in¬ 
terests will be looked after and pro¬ 
tected by him. If the personnel of 
our Council was composed of men like 
him, much of the prejudice and petty 
discriminations to which we are now 
subjected would disappear from our 
midst. It is a very important matter 
for us to have men in the council 
who will give our applications for ap¬ 
pointment on the police, fire and other 
departments of the city the same con¬ 
sideration that is accorded the re¬ 
quests from members of other races. 
We advocate the election of Mr. 
Lyons because we know from a long 
personal acquaintance that he is the 
kind of material we need in the 
Council.

THE LIBERATOR. 


President Roosevelt 
Flayed. His Arbitrary 
Action is everywhere 
Condemned. 

Negro Honor and Army Disgrace. 

In degrading a whole Negro bat¬ 
talion in the army because some of its 
members were criminal and disor¬ 
derly and some others refused to vol¬ 
unteer testimony against them, Presi¬ 
dent Roosevelt has done an unjust 
thing. We are not especially con¬ 
cerned about it, because the more the 
autocratic character of army life over 
private soldiers is disclosed and the 
less army degradation comes to be re¬ 
garded as real degradation the better. 
But here is an interesting case. Such 
members of the battalion as knew of 
the alleged crime would have been 
forced to testify as witnesses; but 
what the president demanded was 
that they should trot up to headquar¬ 
ters and volunteer tales which, if vol¬ 
unteered by one commissioned officer 
with reference to another not under 
his command, would have brought 
him into contempt. And because some 
members of the battalion who may 
have known did not tell. President 
Roosevelt dismisses the whole bat¬ 
talion in disgrace. These Negroes 
are to be congratulated upon being 
put out of the man-killing trade, but 
President Roosevelt is hardly to be 
congratulated upon his ideas of fair 
play as exemplified in this case.—Chi¬ 
cago Public. 


The President’s action in dismiss¬ 
ing a battalion of negro troops without 
trial, because they refused to furnish 
material for rioting and mob violence 
was an act of injustice which would 
make the czar of Russia envious of 
the reputation he has made for inhu¬ 
man treatment of helpless subjects. 
It has called forth a storm of indig¬ 
nant protests from all lovers of fair 
play, regardless of race or color. By 
endorsing the recommendation made 
by Inspector General Garlington after 
an investigation which was a farce, 
and himself a Southern man, he hav¬ 
ing been born in South Carolina and 
apopinted from Georgia, President 
Roosevelt has clasped the hand of 
the treacherous South, lor which he 
has been reaching ever since his elec¬ 
tion to the presidency. He has by 
this act dethroned himself from the 
pedestal of statesmanship to which 
popular sentiment had elevated him 
and has proven that his proper sphere 
is with other mob sympathizers 
and politicians, cunning, unscrupulous 
and dangerous. This action of the 
President has a far more pernicious 
effect upon the future destiny of the 


negro race in America than all the 
adverse criticism and blatant utter¬ 
ances of Brice, Hoke Smith, Vardeman 
and Tillman. We are told that there 
is no higher court of appeal, that Con¬ 
gress cannot remove their disabilities, 
and yet Congress could and did re¬ 
move the disabilities of traitors who 
fought to destroy the Union to which 
these black heroes have given the best 
years of their lives to preserve and 
hold intact. By this action of the 
President, and by the acquiescent si¬ 
lence of the government at Washing¬ 
ton as it views the barbarities prac¬ 
ticed upon them by their Southern op¬ 
pressors, the Negro is made to feel 
that the party of which Theodore 
Roosevelt is the dictator is but a 
phantom of the party of Lincoln, of 
Love joy, of Wendell Phillips and 
Chas. Sumner.

DECLINES TO ACT. 


Dunne Turns Down Tillman. 


Hears Protests of Chicago Negroes 
and Will “Stay Away”—Race Senti- 
ments of Southern Senator Are 
Proved to the Mayor—Will Refuse 
to Preside at the Meeting to Be 
Held Next Wednesday. 

Chicago, Nov. 25.—Mayor Dunne has 
decided that he cannot in his official 
capacity endorse the sentiments on 
the race question expressed by Sen¬ 
ator Benjamin Tillman in his speeches 
before the Senate, and will today de¬ 
cline to preside at the Music Hall 
meeting Wednesday night. 

The Mayor will address a letter to 
the chairman of the committee declin¬ 
ing to act. 

A committee of negroes waited on 
the Mayor today and presented to him 
excerpts of speeches made by Tillman, 
in which the Senator said that “gun 
rule must prevail in the South until 
the negro should change.” The 
Mayor’s action was based on these rep¬ 
resentations. 

Asks for Proof. 

When the first protest from the ne¬ 
groes came to the Mayor beseeching 
him to prevent the Senator from South 
Carolina from delivering a lecture, or 
refusing to preside at the affair un¬ 
less the race question was eliminated 
from his speech, he refused unless 
they could present him with bona-fide 
evidence that Senator Tillman was an¬ 
tagonistic to their race. 

Yesterday afternoon a committee of 
negroes headed by Rev. J. A. Carey 
of Bethel Church called upon the 
Mayor and told him that they were 
prepared to furnish him the evidence 
substantiating their statements. The 
following evidence was given the 
Mayor in part: 

Tillman’s Utterances. 

“On July 30, 1898, in a speech in 
the United States Senate on the “An¬ 
nexation of the Philippines, Porto 


Rico and Cuba,’ Senator Tillman un¬ 
mercifully scored the negro, declaring 
that the negro and white man never 
were equal and that the negro had no 
rights which a white man is bound to 

J’0gpgQt 

“On August 4, 1901, in an address 
at Marinette, Wis., he delivered a 
speech in which he upheld and advo¬ 
cated the mob, lynch law and shot-gun 
policy for black men, women and chil¬ 
dren. 

“July 14, 1902, in a speech before 
the United States Senate on the 
‘Phinippine Civil Government Bill,’ he 
gloated over the fact that whites re¬ 
siding in Mississippi, South Carolina 
and in other Southern States, resorted 
to the shotgun policy in order to sup¬ 
press the negro vote and to maintain 
the supremacy of the whites.” 

The committee in charge declares 
the meeting will be held in spite of 
all protests. 


FOR THE COLORED TROOPS. 


Mass Meeting for New York and Min¬ 
isters and Lawyers to Agitate 
at Washington. 

New York, Nov. 25—A mass meet¬ 
ing to voice a demand that Congress 
make a full investigation of the dis¬ 
missal from the army of the negro 
soldiers of the Twenty-fifth Infantry, 
is scheduled to be held at Cooper 
Union Hall in New York City next 
Thursday. 

Some time during the week, a large 
delegation of ministers, with lawyers 
who have been retained on behalf of 
the negro soldiers, will visit the Presi¬ 
dent at Washington, and urge him to 
reopen the case. 


COLORED WOMAN’S ASSAILANT 
WHITE. 


Planter Given Life Term in Prison 
for His Crime. 

DeKalb, Miss., Nov. 8-W, T. Boyd, 
a white planter, was convicted in the 
Circuit Court today of criminal assault 
on Mandy Watkins, colored, and sen¬ 
tenced to life imprisonment in the 
penitentiary. 

Counsel for both sides agreed on 
this form of punishment, and no ap¬ 
peal will be taken. 


COLORED JUDGE UNSEATED. 

Chicago, Nov. 22.—Ferdinand L. 
Barnet, the negro assistant State's 
Attorney, who, according to police re¬ 
turns, was elected judge of the mu¬ 
nicipal court at the recent election, 
has been unseated by the canvassing 
board. The police returns gave Bar¬ 
nett a plurality cf 499, but the official 
count to^ay shows that Thomas 
Bla^tly, Democrat, was elected by a 
plurality of 504. Barnett was the 
only Republican defeated for a city 
office.

THE NON PARTISAN TICKET. 

The movement to put a non-partisan 
county and city ticket in the field this 
fall is a good one and cannot fail of 
success. The voters are awaiting an 
opportunity to get rid of the present 
Republican machine. There are a few 
good men on the machine’s ticket that 
got on in spite of it. These the non¬ 
partisan ticket will not harm. Unless 
the voters take advantage of the pres¬ 
ent opportunity to smash the machine, 
the Outfall sewer gang, Federal bri¬ 
gade and race track gamblers will 
make them pay dearly for their negli¬ 
gence. The opportunity for the col¬ 
ored voters to get the recognition due 
them has come. Will they let it slip? 
Will they barter it for a promised mess 
of pottage as they have done contin¬ 
ually in the past?

One of the saddest things connected 
with the present campaign is the fact 
that Jim Alexander and a few gimlet¬ 
headed little negroes are making some 
fool Republicans believe that the ne¬ 
groes can be kept in line by telling 
them that Lincoln was a Republican. 
Looking at the negro from Alexander's 
standpoint as a leader, it is no wonder 
that the Republicans of this city have 
no respect for the colored voters. His 
last circular is a vote maker for Har- 
; cn\ All it holds out for the negro 
in the event of Lindley’s elections is 
the pleasure he can get from knowing 
that Lin coln was a Republican. _

THE LIBERATOR. 



IYI1SS LORA JACOBS. 

The announcement of whose mar¬ 
riage to Mr. C. C. Flint, our popular 
colored grocer, has just been made, 
is a native of Richmond, Mo. Miss 
Jacobs is an acknowledged leader of 
her set. Her intelligence and charm¬ 
ing personality are such as to make 
her a valuable acquisition to our com¬ 
munity. Miss Jacobs has rendered 
the race valuable service as a teacher 
in Missouri and Kansas. The pros¬ 
pective bridegroom is a race leader, 
and one of the most successful col- 


MR. C. C. FLINT. 

ored grocers west of the Rocky Moun¬ 
tains. He is a man of broad and pro¬ 
gressive ideas and endowed with in¬ 
domitable energy. As a leader he 
has rendered the race in this city sig¬ 
nal service. He stands for political' 
independence. The adoption of his 
ideas along this line is made more 
evident at each recurring election. 
For more than twenty years he has 
been identified with every movement 
for the advancement of the interests 
of our race in this section. He has 
the best wishes of the entire com¬ 
munity. 


HOW TO VOTE. 

If you want your vote counted do 
not put your stamp in the circle, but 
stamp thus (X) opposite the name of 
Arthur C. Harper first, and then op¬ 
posite the name of every other person 
for whom you desire to vote. 

Hon. Evan Lewis, candidate for City 
Assessor on the Republican ticket, 
should receive the united colored 
vote. He gave the race a permanent 
clerkship in the appointment of Mr. 
Jacobs, now deceased. In spite of the 
fact that he has made a good officer, 
the Times, Dr. Findley’s most ardent 
supporter, backed by other Republican 
Lindley men, are trying to defeat 
him. The Liberator wants him re¬ 
elected because of his fitness and 
recognition of the colored voters. The 
friends of the negro will have the sup¬ 
port of The Liberator, no matter what 
political party nominates them for of¬ 
fice. Hon. Ben E. Ward treated the 
negroes fairly, for this the Republican 
machine tried to defeat him. The lit¬ 
tle self-seeking gang that have sold 
the Afro-American League also tried 
to defeat Mr. Ward, m spite of his 
friendship to the race. The oft-re¬ 
peated statement that Roosevelt hated 
negroes has been proven to be the 
whole truth and nothing but the truth. 

* * * 

Nearly every colored family in the 
city has taken Roosevelt’s picture 
down. Teddy’s picture has disappeared 
from the walls of all negro business 
places, and others have turned his 

face to the wall with “Roosevelt” writ 
ten across the back.

The Chicago Republicans nominated 
Hon. T. L. Barnett for police judge 
to get the negro vote and scratched 
him to a man the election day. Hav¬ 
ing failed to defeat him, asked hin 
to resign. On his refusal to betray 
his race as they had done, counted 
him out and gave his seat to a Dem¬ 
ocrat. There is not a case on record 
where the Democrats have been guilty 
of such base treachery. A little more 
of that kind of “dope” coupled with 
Roosevelt’s square deal for negro sol¬ 
diers, will teach the negro some sense. 


President Roosevelt, by punishing 
the innocent with the guilty colored 
soldiers dismissed from the army, has 
'fully endorsed the mob’s methods. His 
“Door of Hope” and “Square Deal.” 
and Booker Washington dinner were 
merely the tricks of the office seeker. 

♦ ♦ a 

Capt. C. Hance, non-partisan candi¬ 
date for City Treasurer, is no stranger 
to the voters. He served the city as 
clerk several terms so satisfactorily 
that, although Democratic nominee, he 
beat his Republican opponent by a 
handsome plurality each time. Vote 
for him.

Wanted—Our business and profession¬ 
al people to get together and father and 
promote enterprises for the employment 
of young folks. If our college-trained 
men and women cannot get together for 
the advancement of the race, whither 
are we drifting? 

Wanted—At once; an Afro-American 
daily paper published in this city. While 
the paper need not be as large as the 
Times and Examiner, it would do more 
good in manufacturing sentiments in fa¬ 
vor of a “square deal” for our people 
than all of the white papers in the city. 
The tendency of the daily papers to cir¬ 
culate damaging falsehoods against us 
is becoming too prevalent. With no ap¬ 
parent reason, some of our city dailies 
that have been friendly to us, are now 
molding sentiment against us.
