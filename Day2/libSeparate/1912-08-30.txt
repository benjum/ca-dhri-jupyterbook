COL. W. H. HOLABIRD 


COL. W. H. HOLABIRD FOR 
CONGRESS 


With a profound sense of duty, 
we present the name of Col. W. H. 
Holabird to the colored voters 
of this, the Tenth Congressional 
District for their suffrage. In so 
doing we are serving the best 


interest of the district, while per¬ 
forming a sacred duty not only 
to the Negroes of this state, but 
the whole country. 

The strongest argument in favor 
of the election to Congress men of 
the Holabird type, is the position 
taken by Col. Roosevelt relative 
to the Negroes 3 constitutional 


rights. It telegraphic reports are 
true he is willing to disfranchise 
the Southern Negroes permanently 
if by so doing he can get office. 
In a speech delivered to the colored 
voters last week at Ninth and 
Santa Fe Ave. Congressman 
Stephens who is candidate for 
re-election unblushingly justified 
Col. Roosevelt’s revolutionary atti¬ 
tude toward the war amendments. 
Mr. Stephens justifies Col. Roose¬ 
velt’s attempt to disfranchise the 
Negroes by stating that he lived 
four years in the South, and is 
convinced that in spite of the 
Negro’s phenominal, moral, mater¬ 
ial and intellectual advancement 
that the Southern Negroes are 
not entitled to the rights vouch¬ 
safed to them by the federal 
constitution. Colored voters, 
think of it. Your brethren in the 
South whom Mr. Stephens would 
disfranchise, own land by the mil¬ 
lion acres, own and operate many 
banks, own and conduct thousands 
of business houses of every kind, 
supporting many schools of higher 
education, and are led onward 
and upward by thousands of pro¬ 
fessional men of their own pro¬ 
duction, having reduced their il¬ 
literacy sixty per cent in less than 
fifty years—these he would strike 
down with one fell blow in the 
morning of their upward struggle 
if by that sacriligious stroke he 
and his progressive party could 
get control of this government. 
Which will you vote for Mr. 
Stephens or Col. Holabird? Mr. 
Stephens by his own words, is 
a man of small caliber and exceed¬ 
ingly narrow views. Col. Holabird 
is a big, broad man of affairs. 
And regarding the question of 
manhood rights he stands with 
Lincoln, Sumner, John Brown and 
Foraker. In the dark days of 
the sixties when Lincoln called 
for volunteers to rescue the nation 
from the clutches of rebellion, he 
was one of the million brave 
young men who responded to that

call. He was a member of that 
grand army which loyally supported 
the patriots, who made the war 
amendments a part of the consti¬ 
tution thus transforming you from 
chattel to men. With you he 
feels the same keen resentment 
toward the men who would at 
this late day under the guise of 
Republicanism attempt to destroy 
the results of the war and again 
make chattel of men. 

From the standpoint of the high¬ 
waymen, Mr. Stephens’ position 
is a logical one. The highwaymen 
who would rob a bunch of men of 
their valuables, knocks down the 
strongest first. Once the Southern 
Negroes of the country, are shown 
of their political rights, the en¬ 
slavement of the Northern and 
Western Negroes will have been 
completed. 

As a business proposition it 
is to the interest of every voter 
in this district that Col. Holabird 
be elected to Congress. He has 
been more largely identified with 
the phenominal development of 
this city and suburbs than any 
other single man. It was through 
his ingenuity that the water of 
the Colorado River was turned 
into the far famed Imperial Valley, 
transforming what was a sun 
burned treeless desert, into the 
richest agricultural section on the 
globe, capable of sustaining a popu¬ 
lation of two million souls. 

Col. Holabird stands for the 
freedom of the Negro, Mr. Stephens 
stands for his enslavement. On 
the question of the tariff Col. 
Holabird is right. Mr. Stephens 
is “nil.” Vote for Holabird. 


C. C. Flint, Esq., will speak at 
the People’s Lyceum, Cor. 12th 
and Central Ave., Sunday at 4:30. 
All are invited. 


Mr. Albert Hall, son of Mr. I. B. 
Hall, the well known painter and 
decorater, will leave shortly for 
San Francisco to study in the 
Nason Paint Factory. Mr. I. B. 
Hall, his father, is the leading 
colored painter and decorater in 
the city. 


THE JUDICIARY THE BUL¬ 
WARK OF LIBERTY 


Of the three co-ordinate depart¬ 
ments of our government, the Ju¬ 
diciary is by far the most im¬ 
portant to the average citizen. 
It is indeed the bulwark of the 
people’s liberty. Corruption and 
mal-administratjon may exist in 
the other departments of the 
government, but if the judiciary 
is pure, free and untrammeled, all 
citizens, regardless of conditions, 
will in a large measure enjoy their 
inalienable rights. On the con¬ 
trary, if the judiciary is weak and 
vacillating, the rights of the people 
are insecure, no matter how strong 
the other departments. There¬ 
fore in selecting judges, it is of the 
utmost importance that great care 
be taken that only strong, capable, 
upright men are chosen. In the 
selection of judges no one has 
more at stake than the poor peo¬ 
ple whose rights are frequently 
thrown in the balance with those 
of the rich. In the matter of the 
judiciary, all classes of people 
in this country have been exceed¬ 
ingly fortunate for the judiciary 
as a whole has been above re¬ 
proach. In this edition we pre¬ 
sent the cuts of four judges who 
have served the people so satis¬ 
factorily that they have been en¬ 
dorsed for re-nomination by the peo¬ 
ple throughout the County. They 
also have the endorsement of the 
entire County bar. This being one 
of the wealthiest counties in the 
United States, the courts are called 
upon to handle a vast and varied 
amount of business representing 
many and diverse interests. In 
spite of this fact the lawyers 
representing these interests are 
unanimous in their support of the 
judges whose names are presented 
in this edition. 


Mr. R. McDowell, a well known 
contractor and father of Mr. Afue 
McDowell, a popular young at¬ 
torney-at-law, died last week after 
a long illness. We extend our 
sympathy to the family of the 
bereaved. 



Judge George H. Hutton 
Judge George H. Hutton is well 
known and popular with the tax¬ 
payers throughout the county and 
will doubtless be handsomely in¬ 
dorsed for re-nomination at the pri¬ 
maries. Aside from his other ju¬ 
dicial duties, all of whicli have been 
well performed, to him was as¬ 
signed the handling of the feeble 
minded people of the county. Upon 
assuming these duties he immediate¬ 
ly instituted reforms which means 
the restoration of many feeble 
minded people to their homes. 
This reform, alone, entitles him 
to the vote of every woman in 
the county for the reason that 
suffering from feeble minds fall 
heaviest upon mothers and home- 
keepers. Regardless of sex, lovers 
of home and justice will vote for 
Judge George H. Hutton. 


Every Negro voter both male 
and female should go to the polls 
Tuesday and cast their ballot. 
The Negro voters are on trial to¬ 
day as never before. Each Negro 
voter must become a committee 
of one to see to it that his neigh¬ 
bor is urged to go to the polls 
and vote. If the Negro does not 
go to the polls and stand by those 
who stood by him it will be used 
against him in the future.

Judge Frederick W. Houser 


JUDGE PAUL J. McCORMICK 


Among the able and brilliant 
men on the bench, Judge Paul J. 
McCormick holds a high rank and 
his popularity with the people 
is county wide. His re-nomina¬ 
tion by a handsome vote is every¬ 
where conceded. This is due to 
the ability he has displayed and 
the large number of cases he has 
handled, his wise probation system 
and absolute fairness. 


country at large, it would prove 
a powerful deterrent that would 
everywhere lessen crime, raise the 
morality of the people and reduce 
the cost of court proceedings. 
Judge Houser’s record has been 
such that he will be among the 
winners at the primaries. 


ATTORNEY JOHN M. YORK 


JUDGE FREDERICK W.HOUSER 


Judge Frederick W. Houser needs 
no introduction to the voters of 
the county. His services on the 
bench have served that purpose 
long ago. As we have previously 
said: “You will get justice in 
Judge Houser’s court, whether it 
sets you free or sends you to jail.” 
There is a class of criminals who 
deliberately violate the law and 
when hailed into court expect to 
escape through technicalities. In 
Judge Houser’s court this class 
has been greviously disappointed, 
and learned to their cost that they 
must pay the penalty for the laws 
infraction. If such a course was 
adopted by the judiciary of the 


Among the attorneys who aspire 
to the.position of Superior Judge, 
few are better known or more 
popular than Attorney John M. 
York. Enjoying a lucrative law 
practice together with his long 
association with his father, who is 
a well known jurist of distinction, 
Mr. York comes before the people 
eminently fitted for the position 
to which he aspires. He is a 
popular member of the bar and is 
highly spoken of by the colored 
attorneys of the city. Mr. York 
ought to make an excellent judge.

eminent lawyers.

reports a pleasant trip. 



JUDGE JAMES C. RIVES 


Judge James C. Rives ranks as 
one of the ablest probate judges 
in the country and holds a unique 
position of having distributed sev¬ 
eral of the largest estates that 
ever passed through a probate 
court in this country. Property 
belonging to widows and orphans 
amounting to *50,000,000 pass 
through his court annually. It 
is the safe guards that Judge 
Rives has thrown around the prop¬ 
erty of widows and orphans that 
makes his re-nomination at the 
head of the judicial ticket as 
certain as things human can be.

MR. FRANK R. PITNEY 


Mr. Frank R. Pitney who is 
candidate for the assembly from 
the 74th assembly district has been 
making a quiet but successful 
campaign in his district. He ex¬ 
pects to be the winner of the 
nomination as the people through¬ 
out^ the district are supporting 
him loyally. He says if elected 
he will represent his entire district 
regardless of race, color or creed. 
He solicits your vote. 


UP TO THE COLORED VOTER 


Colored voters must keep open 
the door of hope. In the present 
supervisorial fight the Negroes 
clearly have the balance of power, 
it is therefore up to the colored 
voter to say whether or not that 
the right of colored girls to enter 
the nurse training department of 
the County Hospital shall be denied 
them. That this unfortunate 
question is an issue in the present 
fight is entirely due to Messrs. 
Pridham, Butler and Manning. 
When the matter was first made 
public the editor of this journal 
called upon the three gentlemen 
named and asked them to settle 
the whole matter quietly by ad¬ 
mitting the colored girl-applicant 
to the training school. He stated 
that all that was necessary in 
the premises was for them to take 
a firm stand for the right; that 
there was no danger of the resig¬ 
nation of any subordinate at the 
County Hospital on account of 
the admission of a Negro girl. 
He told them further that by vir¬ 
tue of their election they, and not 
the nurses, were the managers of 
the County Hospital. He reminded 
them that the threat to resign from 
office or public position if Negroes 
were given their rights, was a 
very common bluff and never 
materialized when the bluffer was 
given a chance. Capt. Manning 
promised to give the Negroes a 
square deal when the matter came 
up; but Messrs. Pridham and Butler 
stated that they did not propose 
to make politics out of the matter. 
To this the Editor replied that that 
was the reason he appealed to 
them and that it would be imposs¬ 
ible to keep the matter out of 
politics unless the Negro girls were 
given their rights before the open¬ 
ing of the campaign. Over the 
protest of Messrs. Nellis and Mc¬ 
Cabe, Pridham, Butler and Mann¬ 
ing refused to put the matter to 
a vote as to whether or not the 
Negro girls should be admitted, 
and by thus dodging the issue 
forced it into politics. 

The matter of course is still 
under advisement, and, is up to 


the colored voters to join hands 
with the white friends of justice 
and take the matter out from 
under advisement by defeating 
Pridham in the Fifth District and 
re-nominate McCabe in the Second 
District and Nellis in the Fourth 
District. This they have decided 
to do.

Congress 


Twelve Years Practical Experience 
in the House of Representa¬ 
tives 


During that time he was the 
special champion of every Califor¬ 
nia Industry. 

He was always the able and 
effective defender of the orange, 
lemon, walnut, sugar beet, olive 
and raisin growers. 

He secured over $6,000,000 for 
harbor improvements and public 
buildings for Los Angeles County. 

He was the author of the Bill 
for a Pacific Coast Steamship line 
that if established, would free 
us of Railroad domination. 

If returned, he would continue 
fight along the same lines. 


Vote for him at the Primaries 
Sept. 3, 1912. 


The colored voters attention is 
called to the fact that Mr. Chas. 
W. Bell, the opposing candidate 
has the endorsement of the Lissner 
Good Government forces, and 
boast that he is proud of that 
endorsement. 

Our voters are aware of what 
the Lissner Good Government has 
done in not losing an opportunity 
to close “the door of hope” against 
us. 

Mr. McLachlan's record shows 
that he is opposed to such a policy 
and will work for a square deal 
for all. 

We urge the colored voters 
throughout the District to go to 
the polls and vote for Mr. McLach- 
lan, especially those living in Pasa¬ 
dena, Monrovia, Duarte, Azusa 
and Pomona.

CHARLES WELLBORN 


Mr. Chas. Wellborn is another 
of the able and popular candi¬ 
dates for Superior Judge. His 
candidacy is attracting wide sup¬ 
port throughout the county. The 
Claremont Courier speaks of him 
editorially as follows: 

Charles Wellborn 

One of the very best of the many 
good men asking for the position 
of superior judge in this county 
is Mr. Charles Wellborn. He is 
a lawyer of magnificent attain¬ 
ments, a man of splendid public 
record, a man of high ideals and 
strength of character. In fact, 
being the son of such a distin¬ 
guished and able man as Judge 
Wellborn of the United States 
court, is a guarantee of his fitness 
for the position he seeks. 

Mr. Wellborn has for some time 
been in the service of the county. 
He has been appointed by Mayor 
Alexander on different boards and 
in every case he has exhibited his 
fitness for public trust and has 
recognized the wishes of the people. 

The Courier considers him per¬ 
sonally as one of the best men in 
public life and this paper would 
like very much to see him elected, 
assuring the public that he will 
fully demonstrate when on the 


bench,’ the confidence imposed in 
him. 

i - 

Strongly Backed by Members of 
the Los Angeles Bar Association. 


At the solicitation of 30 of the 
leading members of the bar of Los 
Angeles county, as well as of heads 
of departments and other officials of 
the city, Charles Wellborn, member 
of the public service commission, 
has announced his candidacy for the 
superior bench of the county, 
i The members of the bar associa¬ 
tion, including such men as W. J. 
Hunsaker, T. E. Gibbon, Oscar A. 
Trippet, L. H. Valentine, John W. 
Kemp, Judge Wheaton L. Gray, 
John D. Pope, Sheldon Borden, E. 
W. Britt, Geo. H. Smith, John C. 
North, Lucius K. Chase, G. C. De 
Garmo, John G. Mott, Charles Cas¬ 
satt Davis and others, in the com¬ 
munication which they all signed 
and sent to Mr. Wellborn said: We 
are vitally interested in the election 
of honest, able and conscientious 
superior court judges. The volume 
and importance of the business 
transacted by our superior court 
require that these positions be 
filled by lawyers of known ability, 
experience and integrity. We are 
convinced that you possess all 
these qualifications, and are es¬ 
pecially well qualified for a judi¬ 
cial position, and therefore urge 
that you become a candidate at 
the coming primary election . 71 The 
signers also promised to give Well¬ 
born active support in the cam¬ 
paign. 

Many Sign at City Hall 

About the same time a petition 
was circulated at the city hall, 
headed by Mayor Alexander and 
signed by C. H. Hance, Walter 
Mallard, W. M. Humphreys, John 
S. Meyers, Lorin A. Handley, Geo. 
W. McDill, Geo. B. Anderson, Rol¬ 
and Bishop, W. T. Bishop, Frank 
F. Schumacher, Percy F. Schumach¬ 
er, Richard M. Bishop and others, 
asking Wellborn to run.' To both 
he gave a favorable answer. 

Mr. Wellborn is the oldest son of 
Judge Olin Wellborn, United States 
judge in this district. He was born 


MV . 


in Atlanta, Ga., in 1867, and lived 
for a short time in Texas, where 
his father was elected to congress, 
and took his family to Washington. 
There the son received most of his 
education and attended Columbian 
university, being graduated from 
the law department. He came to 
California in 1887 and settled in San 
Diego, where he was admitted to the 
bar, and entered the offices of a firm 
composed of Judge Wellborn, John 
D. Works and John T. Jones. He 
came to Los Angeles in 1896 and 
has lived here since and practiced 
law continuously. 

“Drafted” for Police Board 

In 1911 Mr. Wellborn was one of 
those “drafted” by the mayor to 
serve on the police commission. He 
made an excellent record and at the 
end of a year was promoted by the 
mayor to the public service com¬ 
mission, formerly the water board. 
He is still serving that commission. 
He was a member of the charter 
amendment committee appointed 
by the council in 1909 and is now 
serving as a member of the city 
board of freeholders and the county 
board of freeholders, which are 
preparing new charters for the 
city and county, respectively. 
During his service on these boards 
he has devoted a great deal of 
time to the study of municipal 
charters and has become a recog¬ 
nized authority on such subjectes. 


Put This In Your Hat. 

A number of colored janitors 
who are in the pay of the County 
have been putting in their time 
among the colored voters working 
for Pridham. This is not only an 
insult to colored voters but in¬ 
flicts a wrong upon the taxpayers. 
The colored voters must resent 
this kind of business at the polls. 

If they do their rights will be 
respected after the election.

MR. C. J. NELLIS CANDIDATE 
FOR SUPERVISOR FROM 
THE FOURTH DISTRICT 


The re-nomination of Mr. C. 
J. Nellis from the Fourth Super¬ 
visorial District is conceded on 
every hand though by a small 
plurality. This is not enough; if 
the colored voters in the Fourth 
District do their duty and they 
will, Mr. Nellis will come out of 
the contest with at least 1000 
plurality. Every colored voter 
male and female should become 
a committee of one to pass the 
word down the line that every 
colored voter in the District be 
on hand at the primaries next 
Tuesday, September 3rd and vote 
for C. J. Nellis. Mr. Nellis’ white 
friends, who represent the best 
people in the district, are putting 
forth supreme efforts to secure 
his nomination. The Negroes to 
a voter, will do the same thing. 


MR. H. D. McCABE 


In the Second Supervisorial Dis¬ 
trict the sentiment in favor of 
the re-nomination of Mr. McCabe 
has overwhelmed everything. Mr. 
McCabe is exceedingly popular 
with all classes in the district 
and will increase his former vote. 


The candidacy of Rev. D. R. 
Jones which for a while threatened 
to divide the colored vote is now 
no longer a factor. Rev. Jones 
who is a thorough race man will 
not urge the colored voters to 
vote for him since he sees such a 



H. D. McCABE 

course will give the nomination 
to Mr. Horton a Pridhain candi¬ 
date. Mr. Horton has the secret in¬ 
dorsement of the Lissner machine 
and therefore is in full sympathy 
with Pridham, Butler and Manning. 

Mr. McCabe will poll the full 
colored vote and be nominated. 


MR. CHAS. E. PATTERSON 


The whole Progressive machine 
has decided that Mr. Pridham will 
be defeated in the Fifth District. 
It is conceded that the rich people 
in North and South Pasadena 
will vote for Mr. Pridham, but the 
1st and 8th wards of this city 
which are inhabited wholly by 
working people together with the 
country precincts will wipe the 
North and South Pasadena vote 
off of the face of the earth, nomi¬ 
nating Mr. Patterson by a large 
majority. The foundation for the 
magnificent roads that the country 
people now have and which have 
enhanced property values every¬ 
where were laid very largely by 
Mr. Patterson the country people 
have not forgotten this. Mr. Pat¬ 
terson is well known and popular 
with the colored people of his 
district due to his manly stand 
for absolute justice to all. The 
attempt of the Pridham people to 
use this against him has proven 
a boomerang. Every colored voter 
in the Fifth District will turn out 
and help nominate him. 



FRANK H. MOUSER 


In the Seventy-fourth Assembly 
district, the leading candidate for 
the Republican nomination is 
Frank H. Mouser, the represnta- 
tive of the Progressive element. 
Mr. Mouser is making an active 
and strenuous campaign, of the 
kind that appeals to the average 
American citizen. His friends be¬ 
lieve that at the primary election 
he will win the nomination easily. 

Mr. Mouser is a champion of 
the plain people. He believes in 
the laboring man and is not afraid 
to say so. He stands upon a 
platform which includes the eight 
hour day, employer's liability, com¬ 
pensation for men and women in¬ 
jured in the industries, a minimum 
wage law and strict sanitary ragu- 
lations to protect the health of 
the toilers. 

Mr. Mouser is a good friend of 
all of the people, and as such has 
long been recognized. He has 
never failed to extend favors and 
courtesies to the colored folks 
whenever opportunity presented it¬ 
self. His father, A. C. Mouser, is 
attorney for the Colored Coloni¬ 
zation Company of San Diego 
and has the respect and affection 
of the entire colored population 
of that city. The son is a “chip 
off the old block." 

Mr. Mouser is a Roosevelt man 
and will support Roosevelt elec¬ 
tors. He has the endorsement of

STEPHENS CHALLENGED TO 
DEBATE 


Los Angeles, California 
August 26th, 1912. 

Mr. Maximillian Ihmsen 
Los Angeles Examiner 
City. 

Dear Mr. Ihmsen:— 

Mr. Wm. D. Stephens, today 
by accepting the presumed honor 
of presiding at a public meeting 
where the candidate for the Vice 
President of the new Political 
Party called “Progressive,” is to 
speak, has allied himself publicly 
and openly with the new party 
and by so doing has deserted, 
seceded from, and played traitor 
to the Republican Party, who 
elected him to his high office. 

I challenge the right of Mr. 
Stephens to one solitary vote by 
any person registered, according 
to the laws of the State of Califor¬ 
nia, as a Republican. 

The Primary Laws of the state 
were presumed to purify politics, 
not to deliberately plan and execute 
corrupt practices. 

It is an outrage and a political 
crime for Mr. Stephens to ask, 
expect or accept a vote from any 
person registered as a Republican 
for him as a member of Congress 
representing the Tenth District, 
as a Republican and I now challenge 
Mr. Stephens to a public debate 
at any time and in any place as 
to the political honesty of this, 
his public action. 

Yours very truly, 
W. H. Holabird.

THE LIBERATOR 


THE COLORED INDHPENDENT 
POLITICAL LEAGUE 
REPUDIATED 


The organization (?) of the 
colored Independent Political 
League that was announced in the 
last Saturday’s Times has been 
denounced as the rankest fake 
of the campaign. And stands on 
a par with the Negro Good Gov¬ 
ernment Club which did violence 
to the good names of every prom¬ 
inent Negro preacher in the city 
during the late municipal cam¬ 
paign. This colored Political 
League (?) was organized by the 
“Rev. Dr. Gordon McPherson/’ 
who broke into the city from God 
knows where and led the fight for 
the Socialist ticket during the 
late municapal campaign. 

In the early part of the summer 
this same “Dr. McPherson” or¬ 
ganized a Roosevelt Club, which 
died on his hands long before 
Roosevelt and Johnson kicked the 
Negroes out at Chicago. 

The rapidity with which “Dr. 
McPherson” changes his politics, 
and organizes political clubs and 
the loose manner with which he 
uses men’s names without their 
consent, is undoubtedly due to 


dull times in the preaching busi¬ 
ness. Without their knowledge and 
consent, the names of Messrs. 
C. C. Flint, J. G. Edmonds, and 
the Editor of this journal were 
used in connection with that fake 
club. To use men’s names in 
this manner, without their consent, 
is dangerous business. It is a 
violation of the law, which unless 
stopped at once, will result in 
landing some of these eleventh 
hour Negroes in jail. The scan¬ 
dalous position the Negro minist¬ 
ers were placed in by the leaders of 
the Negro Good Government or¬ 
ganization, in the last municipal 
campaign is still fresh in the mem¬ 
ory of citizens of this city. They 
made the Negro ministers parties 
to the statements that were ab¬ 
solutely vicious and untrue and 
put the Negro voters and their 
ministers in such a ridiculous po¬ 
sition that the Good Government 
officeholders have been enabled to 
treat them with contempt. The 
tricky officeholder is always on 
the lookout for just such a loop¬ 
hole as the Negro Good Govern¬ 
ment Club made for them. 

We are in receipt of the following 
letters from two gentlemen whose 
names were falsely used by the 


organizers of the fake Independent 
Political League.
