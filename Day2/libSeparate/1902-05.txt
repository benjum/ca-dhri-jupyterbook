Another Mob Laid Out. 

Will Richardson Kills 
Four. 

ATLANTA, Ga., May 1. —Four white 
men and three negroes dead, five white 
men and one negro wounded, and an 
entire block of building burned is tue 
result of a conflict that began here 
early today between *.~e police and 
blacks. Will Richardson, half Indian 
and half negro, the owner of a store 
in McDaniel street, in the suburbs 
of Pittsburg, and four other negroes, 
brought on the trouble by resisting ar¬ 
rest and defying the officers of Fulton 
county and Atlanta. The dead: 

Edward Batele, a bailiff of Fulton 
county. 

H. G. Osborne, a policeman of Fulton 
county. 

Thomas Grant, a city policeman. 

Edward Crabtree, a city policeman. 

Will Richardson,the negro who killed 
these men. 

Milton Rosby, a negro who attempted 
to escape from a sewer. 

An unknown negro killed in a 
nearby yard. 

The wounded: 

S. A. Kerim, beaten by negroes. 

W. A. Wright, a county policeman, 
wounded in the left shoulder. 

W. T. Jackson, a street car con¬ 
ductor, wounded in hip. 

Owen Heard, a county policeman, 
wounded in the thigh. 

Officer Spreadlin, wounded in the 
arm. 

Shepard Finzer, negro, shot through 
hand. 

The fight between the officers and 
the negroes occurred in Pittsburg, a 
negro settlement, directly south of the 
city limits, on McDaniel street. 

WILL RICHARDSON: The killing 
of four white men by Will Richardson 
at a colored settlement in the suburbs 
of Atlanta, Ga., on the 17th shows the 
deplorable condition that mob law has 
brought about in the South. In this . 
case Richardson acted just as a white 
man would or should have done under 
the circumstances. It was 1:30 o’clock 
when a crowd of white men knocked 
at his store and calleu upon him to 


surrender. No warrant was read' the 
chances are that they had none. As 
Richardson was a merchant and had 
committeed no felony, there was no 
reason for his arrest at that hour of 
the night. Further, if Richardson had 
any desire to run off he had ample time 
to leave before the so-called officers 
arrived. He was no stranger in the 
neighborhood, being a merchant, his 
place of habitation was well known. 
The object of their visit being to lynch 
Richardson, 1:30 o’clock at night was 
chosen as the best time to carry out 
their unlawful intentions. Richardson 
was prepared for just such an emer¬ 
gency, and the manner in which he 
met it meets with the approval of fair- 
minded, law-abiding citizens every¬ 
where. The man Kerlin went out to 
the colored settlement no doubt looking 
for trouble and got it, and more—he 
got his friends into lots of trouble also. 
This last battle of Atlanta was one of 
the most remarkable in the history of 
the country. Think of it. It took one 
negro with a torch, 2000 white men, 
not counting the boys, all armed with 
rifles, and the destruction by fire of 
a whole row of buildings, all the prop¬ 
erty of negroes, to dislodge one lone 
negro, who was quietly working the 
trigger of a Winchester rifle. Every 
crack of his trusty rifle was follewed 
by a shriek from some member of the 
mob. This was so unexpected it so 
demoralized the mob that Richardson 
bounded squirrel-like from one cabin 
to another, each time adding to the 
demoralization and excitement of the 
mob by sending a fresn rifle ball into 
some of its members, without risk to 
himself. Finally, to save itself the 
mob appealed to the governor for aid; 
in the meantime Richardson disap¬ 
peared; the mob being too busy seek¬ 
ing shelter to bother with him. After 
the smoke of the battle cleared away 
a skull and the remains of a rifle were 
found in one of the burned cabins. 
These relics are supposed to he the 
former property of Richardson. No ef¬ 
fort is being made, however, to prove 
it, the mob being happy in the suppo¬ 
sition that either it is Richardson’s 
skull or that he has taken up his resi¬ 
dence elsewhere. He is not wanted in 
Atlanta. 

-o- 

HIGH-PRICED LIVES: This at¬ 
tempt by southern mobs to cheapen the 
lives of negroes by denying them trials 


by juries when charged with offenses 
had the opposite effect in the cases of 
Will Reynolds of Alabama and Will 
Richardson of Georgia. In the cases 
cited above it was the white men’s 
lives that went cheap and negroes' lives 
that were dear. For his life Reynolds 
required those of seven white men. 
Richardson required four for his, These 
negroes certainly put high value upon 
their lives. Single-handed they killed 
eleven lynchers and wounded twenty- 
six and fought fire at the same time. 
With an army of these kind of boys, 
Uncle Sam could whip the world- Wt 
have contended all along that tne lives 
of negroes could not be cheapened with¬ 
out cheapening those of white men. 
If white men continue to set the laws 
of the land at defiance, negroes will do 
the same. No man ought to surrender 
to an officer whom he knows cannot or 
will not protect him from a mob. The 
officer who attempts to make an arresc 
under such circumstances, with the 
knowledge of the situation, is parti- 
ceps criminis, and if he loses his life 
in the attempt he is simply the victim 
of his own perfidy. As juries no longer 
regard mob murders as crimes the only 
way to punish them is for the intended 
victims to sell out as dear as possible, 
when called upon to surrender to an of¬ 
ficer who- is acting for the mob, which 
is usually the ease in mob-ridden sec¬ 
tions. When an officer allows himself 
to become the tool of a mob he should 
not be surprised if he pays the penalty 
of his perfidy. Suspend the law in'deal- 
ing with a man and it will not he long 
before he will suspend them in his 
dealings. The only way to have the 
laws of the land respected is to enforce 
them. The man who joins a mob must 
be taught that he forfeits the protec¬ 
tion of the laws he goes out to violate. 
Mob law is anarchy, and mob sympa¬ 
thizers are anarchists and the sooner 
the whole tribe is exterminated the 
longer the nation will live. 

-o- 

Four Atlanta, Ga., policemen learn¬ 
ed too late that Will Richardson’s cab¬ 
in was his castle and that he had the 
manhood to defend it. This thing of 
arresting negroes and turning them 
over to mobs is playing out. What 
was once a pastime for mobs is now 
becoming certain death. This new plan 
that is being worked so successfully on 
Southern mobs is a desperate remedy 
for a desperate disease. It will cure 
the disease.

THAT TEXAS HORROR: In the 
midst of universal sorrow in which 
Mont Pelee plunged the world when 
with burning gas she put out the spark 
of life of 30,000 souls, with 225 miners 
lying dead in Tennessee, and 100 of 
her own men, women and children 
cold in death as the result of a tor¬ 
nado, Texas gives humanity another 
shock more cruel, more heartless, more 
fiendish and attended with far more 
suffering than was experienced by the 
whole host of those who recently went 
down to untimely graves amidst the 
sorrow of weeping world. A negro 
man charged with assault of some kind 
and attempted robbery, the charge be¬ 
ing so vaguely stated in the dispatches 
as to leave the reader in doubt as to 
his crime, if any was committed, was 
chained to a stake and slowly tortured 
to death with hot irons and coals of 
fire. Special trains were run and 
through trains captured and forced to 
carry persons who desired to witness or 
take part in the awful torture. The 
hand on the dial of the twentieth cen¬ 
tury civilization was turned back and 
the dark ages and inquisition, with 
other tortures that southern mobs 
have acquired by long study in the arts 
of torture, were put into practice. 
White women threw away their hu¬ 
man hearts and tried to force their way 
through the mob in order that they 
might view the nude writhing form of 
the tortured negro and inhale the sick¬ 
ening odor of his burning flesh. Mor¬ 
gan was tortured into a confession,then 
tortured for confessing. Slow and aw¬ 
ful as was his suffering and death the 
mob was disappointed, for his death 
came too soon. When his head fell 
forward a wail of sorrow went up from 
the mob. Then the fight for the ghastly 
relics ensued. To the credit of the 
men, they were gallant enough to fur¬ 
nish the ladies with such of the relics 
as they desired. Oh, the horrible scene! 
The imagination, though dull, draws a 
picture that causes the heart to swell, 
the blood to run slow, language grows 
dumb, dries up the flood of sympathetic 
tears and leaves the beholder the vic¬ 
tim of a burning thirst for revenge. 
Thank God, we can have no revenge. 
It would transform us into a brute als^. 
Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord; I 
will repay. 

Morgan surrendered to the officers of 
the law. They surrendered him to the 
mob to be burned alive. He pleaded to 


the mob in vain to shoot him. He could 
have made them glad to shoot him, but 
he let the opportunity slip. His cries 
from the stake told the negroes in 
tones louder than thunder, “Never sur¬ 
render to officers in mob-ridden sec¬ 
tions when charged with crime. Make 
them shoot you as Reynolds and Rich¬ 
ardson did and save the country from 
mob outrages. We have said before 
that “the brute who assaults a woman 
is as brutal as the mob that burns him 
at the stake.” If Morgan was guilty 
he was an angel besides those who put 
him to death. If he was guilty he 
would have been punished to the full 
extent of the law as he deserved. If 
guilty he was spurred on by an insane 
desire for that which was not his. 
Color prejudice had abridged his rights, 
curtailed his opportunities to acquire 
a Christian education, had denied to 
him the attributes of man. Because 
his skin was black society made him 
an outcast, a thing with no rights that 
white men are bound to respect. It 
conspired to make him the brute that 
it was claimed he was. He was a negro 
and had no more rights to lofty aspir¬ 
ations than an educated, refined negro 
woman had to desire admission into 
the Federation of Women’s Clubs. If 
guilty, society made a success. To the 
white men who murdered him society 
denied no opportunity for mental and 
moral development, withheld from 
them no good thing; churches, schools, 
lectures, theaters and all places of 
amusement were opened to them. 
Every ambition was petted, every as¬ 
piration encouraged. To them no ave¬ 
nue was closed. Compare Morgan’s 
crime and opportunities with theirs 
and choose between them. Their deed 
was born of disregard for God and man, 
law, order and decency, a savage thirst 
for human blood, a fiendish desire to 
inflict untold misery upon their fellow 
man that they might revel in the music 
of his dying groans. 

THE WHITE PRESS of the country 
has had nothing to say as far as we 
have learned. In encouraging mobs 
they have wrought greater than they 
know. Either they have no words 
with which to express their disgust and 
condemnation, or they are afraid of 
the monster of their making. Oh, no, 
the press is silent; the church and 
state are as silent as the grave. The 
South is lighting a torch that will burn 
more people than all the volcanic erup¬ 


tions ever did since the world began. 
"Whatsoever a man soweth that shall 
he also reap.”

HEREDITY AND CRIME. 


NEW YORK, May 22.—Startling sta¬ 
tistics on criminalogy have been pre¬ 
sented at the annual convention of the 
New York County W. C. T. U. One of 
the delegates presented a statement 
to the effect that a woman of criminal 
tendencies, whose name was not made 
public for obvious reasons, died in 
1827. 

“Her descendants have been traced,” 
continued the speaker. “Seven hundred 
were criminals convicted at least once; 
thirty-seven were murderers and were 
executed for their crimes.” 

“This family,” the speaker concluded, 
“has cost the nation $3,000,000 for 
trails and executions.” 

If the descendants of one lawless 
dissolate woman cost the country $3,- 
000,000 what will the descendants of 
the 125,000 persons who ^ave taken 
part in lynching in this country in 
the past fifteen years cost the nation? 
Great heavens! Think of the white 
women and girls who have witnessed 
the burning of nude negro men at the 
stake. What will their children be? 
What can they be? In the cases of such 
women and girls the practice of pre¬ 
natal murder that is so popular in re¬ 
fined circles would seem to be a stroke 
of legal economy. Like begets like.

J. L. Edmonds has bought five acres 
of land at Sawtelle, where he will go 
with his family next -September, and 
engage quite extensively in vegetable 
gardening. The soil of his recent pur¬ 
chase is well adapted to the growing 
of vegetables, and we may expect Mr. 
Edmonds to make a name for himself 
in the growing of fine specimens, as 
he is a splendid gardener.

J. L. Edmonds, the farmer-journal¬

cept our thanks for a fine sample of 
onions and potatoes of his growing. 
He produces some of the finest pota¬ 
toes we have seen in this state, and de¬ 
clares it is a shame to use such good 
land just to build houses on, when it 
will produce such good vegetables. But 
can everybody grow such perfect speci¬ 
mens, neighbor?—South Pasadenan,

CALIFORNIANS TREAT THE NE¬ 
GROES WELL. 

What we have said on several occa¬ 
sions we reiterate now, that no state 
in the Union offers its colored citizens 
better opportunities to earn and enjoy 
wealth or treated them fairer than this 
state. In no part of the state does the 
negro get better opportunities than he 
has in Southern California. He is 
treated with exceptional kindness and 
is given every reasonable inducement 
to acquire education and wealth. The 
white people encourage all of his busi¬ 
ness enterprises. He not only has a 
chance to spend his money as he 
pleases, but an opportunity to make 
and save it, The churches, schools, 
lectures and places of amusement are 
open to him. The people take pleas¬ 
ure in his success and aid him if mis¬ 
fortune overtakes him. Everywhere 
you go about the city you find him at 
work, working for white people, 
whether his profession is stenography, 
law, medicine or hodcarrying. He is 


treated as a man in proportion as he 
regards himself as such. 

If charged with violation of the law 
the presumption is in his favor and 
gives him the benefit of the doubt. 
Judges and juries are absolutely im¬ 
partial in dealing with him and will 
not convict him of a crime unless his 
guilt is clearly established. In spite 
of frequent attempts of miguided peo¬ 
ple to malign him and create a senti¬ 
ment antagonistic to his interests, 
public sentiment in favor of giving 
him fair play seems to grow fat on 
these efforts. If he commits a breach 
of the peace there is no attempt to 
magnify it. He is thought to be no 
better than white men and if he com¬ 
mits a crime he receives the same pun¬ 
ishment for it that a white man would 
receive for its commission. This pol¬ 
icy puts him upon his merits and 
emplants in him respect for law and 
order. The law-abiding Christian peo¬ 
ple of this state, by their humane treat¬ 
ment of their colored citizens, are do¬ 
ing great work not only for them, but 
for humanity.

PROF. MOORE OF KNOXVILLE, 
TENN. 


We had the pleasure of meeting Prof. 
Moore, principal of the Knoxville In¬ 
dustrial school for colored youths. He 
made an extended tour of the West, es¬ 
pecially the Pacific coast. The object 
of his visit being to see how the land 
lay and what opportunities the West 
offered the intelligent thrifty negro. 
At the conclusion of his tour he ex¬ 
pressed himself as well pleased with 
the many business chances for colored 
men here that are slipping by almost 
unnoticed. Prof. Moore possesses a 
strong personality, is a man of a few 
words and a close observer. Everybody 
whom he met took a deep interest in 
him and everything was done to make 
his visit pleasant and profitable. He 
met several teachers and others in ter¬ 
es ted in educational work in the city 
and county, among whom Prof. Foshay, 
superintendent of the city schools. 
The impression he made upon them 
was indeed favorable. Accompanied 
by Rev. Donohoo, Mr. H. Boone of 
Pasadena and the editor. Prof. Moore 
visited Sawtelle. The trip from the 
city took us through the lands lying be¬ 
tween here and the ocean. At Saw¬ 
telle Mr. Tucker, a veteran of the civil 


war, and one who marched with Sher¬ 
man to the sea, hitched up his rig and 
took the party for a drive through the 
beautiful country around tne 'Soldiers’ 
Home. It was a pleasant drive through 
a beautiful fertile country. Its splen¬ 
did crops everywhere bespoke a boun- 
tious harvest. 

-o- 

The North and South are again 
united, but the price paid by the North 
for the union may prove as costly in 
the end as all compromises do that 
are obtained by a sacrifice of principle. 
To say “we are united” the North has 
agreed practically to allow the South 
to nullify the constitution and amend¬ 
ments so for as the Negro is concern¬ 
ed. The results of the war have been 
set aside; it is now admitted that 
Davis was right and Lincoln wrong. 
Truly the righteous are repenting to 
sinners. Jackson wanted to hang Cal¬ 
houn for advocating nullification, “t 
was a crime then, but it is a virtue 
now. How little Jackson knew! 

If the admission of a few educated 
colored women to the Federation of 
Women’s Clubs will cause the South 
to secede, this union of the North and 
South of which we hear so much now¬ 
adays is a very delicate affair. 

--——o- 

If Christ had been at Simpson audi¬ 
torium when those Christian ladies 
voted that Negro women are not to be 
included in the Federation s work of 
elevating womanhood, and that the 
Golden Rule does not extend to Negro 
women, it would again be said of Him 
“Jesus wept.” 

-o——- 

So rapid has been the advancement 
of the Negro woman in intelligence, 
virtue and refinement during her 
thirty-five years of Freedom that the 
Federation of Women’s Clubs at their 
recent Biennial decided that no test 
would prevent her from entering and 
occupying a prominent place in the 
Federation hut the color test. If given 
an opportunity, the Negro woman 
could and would surmount all other 
obstacles. That is what the vote on 
the color question says, as the voters 
were all intelligent, cultured women, 
their decision is a good endorsement 
of the Negro woman’s splendid quali¬ 
ties. Even the color test will fall to 
the ground unless the white men quit 
giving us 30,000 mulatto youngsters 
annually.

Rev. Kelley Heard From 
Again. 

BASE HYPOCRISY. 


This community has been much 
wrought up during the past week over 
the case of Rev. J. H. Kelley. While 
many are willing to give him the ben¬ 
efit of a doubt on the charge of seduc¬ 
tion, there was so much damaging tes¬ 
timony adduced against him that his 
usefulness as a minister is gone. No 
matter what the final outcome of the 
present case, it will be the basest 
hypocrisy for such a man to pose as 
a teacher of the religion of Jesus 
Christ. The blow is a most unfortu¬ 
nate one, not only to the Third Bap¬ 
tist church, and the colored citizens of 
this community, but to religion itself, 
and there should be no attempt to 
shield or condone the offense. Better 
no church at all than one whose at¬ 
mosphere threatens the downfall of 
young girls and the loss of that purity 
which true religion teaches and which 
should be dearer to them than life. 
The future usefulness of the Third 
Baptist church is threatened, and its 
members have a duty to perform, and 
they must do it like true Christian 
men and women. During the past two 
years there has been too much rotten¬ 
ness going on under the cloak of re¬ 
ligion, and the characters of too 
many young ladies smirched, and, 
since a case is now in the courts, and 
therefore public property, action can 
be deferred no longer. It is a very 
bad state of affairs, and the only way 
to purge the church of the dark stain 
that now attaches to it is to meet the 
issue squarely, and show to the world 
that it stands neither for seduction 
nor fornication.—Western Outlook. 

The above editorial from the West, 
ern Outlook meets our hearty approval. 
If the atmosphere of a community is 
to be kept pure the pulpit will have 
to be kept above suspicion. No 
church can afford to keep in its pulpit 
a minister who cannot avoid even the 
appearance of evil,” It makes little 
difference which way this case temin- 
ates,. Rev. Kelley’^ usefulness as a 
minister on the Pacific coast is gone. 

The testimony of a Mrs. Harris that 
Rev. Kelley paid the young girl’s ex¬ 
penses at a private hospital puts him 


in a very bad light. Rev. Kelley’s 
friends are not surprised, for, although 
he always showed a remarkable fond¬ 
ness for the softer sex, he never spoke 
of marriage except with a sneer. This 
“laying on of hands” on handsome 
young church women by amorous min¬ 
isters to frighten off other evil spirits 
always leads to trouble. Rev. Kelley 
has managed in some way to keep 
himself before the public *n an un¬ 
enviable light, either in a rat swallow¬ 
ing fake or as defendant in a nauseous 
law suit. Go east, parson, and cool 
off. 


The Negro never had better oppor¬ 
tunities for bettering his condition 
than he enjoys today. That’s why 
the Negro haters are so active. There 
are more Negroes employed at good 
salaries in business houses now than 
ever before in this city. The Negro is 
giving more time to business, money 
making and money saving, in other 
words he is acting in the living pres¬ 
ent. He is embarking into all

GREAT IS THE TIMES. 

The lynching of negroes still goes 
on, and the normal American con¬ 
tinues to blush for some sections of his 
country, and for some portion of his 
countrymen. It seems to be about 
time for the national government to 
take a hand in this thing, looking to 
a stop to such proceedings as dis¬ 
grace this people, and their flag, which 
is presumed to stand for law, order 
and good government.—Times. 


The editor’s acknowledgment of the 
editorial from the Times herewith pub¬ 
lished. 

Editor The Los Angeles Times, Los 
Angeles, Cal. 

MY DEAR SIR: 

For the editorial against the lynch¬ 
ing horror, published in today’s Times, 
please accept, through me, the sincere 
thanks of ten million colored Ameri¬ 
can citizens. The silence of the press 
and pulpit with regard to these horri¬ 
ble burnings at the stake and cruel 


tortures perpetrated upon negroes sus¬ 
pected of crime, has been not only a 
mystery, but a source of great sor- 
how to the negroes of this country. 

The history of the negroes in this 
country seems to merit for .hem bet¬ 
ter treatment. In every great sorrow 
the people of the United States have 
had our sincere sympathy. In every 
struggle for their advancement they 
have had our aid and hearty co-opera¬ 
tion. In every struggle in which the 
country has engaged we tuutv tile coun¬ 
try’s side. Wherever its flag has been 
assailed we have defended it with oiu 
lives. 

Today, while the colored troops are 
in the far-away east, fighting the bat¬ 
tles of our great republic to protect 
life and property in the Philippines, 
the lives and property of their breth¬ 
ren at home are lifting ruthlessly de¬ 
stroyed. 

The cry of our dying from the .stake 
or some other method of slow death, 
sends to heaven an almost unbroken 
wail. With the destruction of our 
constitutional rights in the South com¬ 
plete and trial by jury suspended, we 
stand in the midst of our dead and 
dying with bowed heads and broken 
hearts, overshadowed by a profound 
sorrow, surrounded by our white fel¬ 
low citizens in the full enjoyment of 
peace and prosperity, with none to 
drop for us a sympathetic tear. 

In .the name of humanity and the 
rising generation, I hope and pray that 
the white people of this country will 
do something—do something right 
away. 

Thanking you again, I .iave the 
honor to be. 

Sincerely yours, 

J. L. EDMONDS,

200 SHARES. 

The Business Men’s Association has 
placed 200 shares of its capital stock 
on the market. These shares are $10 
each, the purchaser paying $1 on each 
share purchased and $1 per month on 
each share until the full amount of his 
purchase has been paid in. The asso¬ 
ciation will advance the price of shares 
as soon as those placed on the market 
are sold. Already there is a number 
of applications for shares ranging from 
one to ten. One lady desiring ten 
shares proposes to pay the whole 
amount cash. The confidence our peo¬ 


ple are displaying in the association 
is very gratifying and shows a 
healthy desire to combine their 
means for their common good. 
This marks the beginning of great 
business activity among us, which is 
bound to inspire in the colored people 
of this city confidence in each other. 
That great good will be done goes 
without saying. So mote it be. 

-o-- 

The howl of Tillman and Carmack 
about cruelties in the Philippines will 
deceive no sensible, honest voter in 
this country as long as they champion 
the cause of those who mob and burn 
colored American citizens on account 
of their color. 

--o--- 

The murder of innocent Negroes for 
spite because a brave Negro lays our 
a mob, as was done in Atlanta, Ga., 
the other day, will only make bad mat¬ 
ters worse. It will ultimately force 
every Negro to die with his gun smok¬ 
ing when he hears that a Negro in his 
locality has fired upon a mob. 
It is simply deplorable, but it is the 
only fruit that mob law. produces 
Mob law is anarchy, and he who slays 
a mob, whether it comes in the ca¬ 
pacity or not, renders his country im¬ 
mortal service. Will Reynolds took 
seven and Will Richardson four to the 
eternal camping ground. Oh, the 
pity of it! But it is the only way 
out. 

-o--- 

The catastrophe at Martinique was 
the most appalling in modern times. It 
shows the utter helplessness of man 
in the face of nature’s upheavals. 
How insignificant is man? When 
Mother Eearth trembles mountains ap¬ 
pear and disappear as bubbles and man 
and his handiwork are annihilated in 
the twinkling of an eye. Then there is 
a mighty calm,profound silence reigns 
and things move on as though man 
had not been. There is nothing certain 
but death, nothing real but God, the 
architect of nature and its stupendous 
works. To man things are, and are 
not. Today the world is not large 
enough for him, „ tomorrow he is “pa¬ 
thetic dust.” “What is man that Thou 
art mindful of him or the son of man 
that Thou visiteth him?” 

-o- 

Peace and order reign in Atlanta, 
Ga., and it is agreed that “the colored 
troops fought nobly,” even though in 
a mighty bad cause. These racial 
outbreaks, if such they may be termed, 
are one of the greatest sorrows of the 
south.—L. A. Times.
