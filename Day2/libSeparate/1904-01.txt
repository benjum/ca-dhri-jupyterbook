THE WASHINGTON AND HUD¬ 
DLESTON BLOCK. 

This two-story block, 331, 313 and 335 
South Spring street, is the most valuable 
piece of property in the city owned by 
colored persons. Besides other valua¬ 
ble property this Spring street block 
gives them an income of $5°° P er month, 
or $6000 a year. By the erection of a 


six or eight story building on the pres¬ 
ent site, which they contemplate doing, 
this property can be made to yield an 
income of $30,000 to $40,000 annually. 
Its location is one of the most popular 
as well as the most valuable on Spring 
street. Almost opposite this property 
on the northeast corner of Spring and 
Fourth streets is the new million-dollar 
Helman block; on the opposite corner 
stands the immense twelve-story build¬ 


ing of the Southern California Bank, 
with the Angelus Hotel, the finest fn 
Southern California, facing it on the 
west. This property, which is now val¬ 
ued at $200,000, can easily be made 
worth a milhon. The Washington and 
Huddleson families owe it to themselves 
and that aristocratic location to put up a 
modern office block that will be in keep¬ 
ing with its surroundings. This Mr. 
Washington is very anxious to do. This 
done, the owners will be millionaires. 


Just about Ready for a Suit? 

If not an “F. B. Q.” Suit, why what? . . . 

You don’t think all the men who’ve been buying- here are mistaken in their judgment. 

You don’t think Wanatnaker is wrong because he gives “F. B. Q . first place in his ng 

clothing house. . . . . . 

“F. B. Q.” clothing is what all clothing aims to be. 

The good things we say ahout it fit it, . , . 

You are not disappointed when you come expecting a great deal of value for ordinary prices.

THE LIBERATOR. 



MAYOR M. P, SNYDER. 


By Courtesy of The L. A. Express 


A Memorial Window Dedi¬ 
cated to Mrs. Biddy 
Mason 

Mayor Snyder Delivers the 
Address 

A Fitting Remembrance 

His Honor, Mayor Snyder, yester¬ 
day afternoon proved his ability as a 
pulpiteer, and in his efforts at the me¬ 
morial window dedicption at the new 
First African M. E. Church, he called 
forth loud acclaims of ‘'Amen!” “Yes, 
that’s so, bless the Lord!” “Yes, indeed, 
Brother Mayor.” The Mayor’s address 
was the feature of the affair. It was 
a memorial to Mrs. Biddy Mason, an 
old pioneer of Los Angeles, conceded 


to have been the richest colored woman 
west of the Mississippi Valley. 

This woman left a record, not alone 
of remarkable business acumen, con¬ 
sidering her opportunities, but also as 
a great-hearted, charitable Christian 1 , 
whose good works and lovable charac¬ 
ter are cherished in the hearts of 
many pioneers. The memorial window 
was placed in the new church by her 
daughter, Mrs. W. H. Washington of 
Toberman street. 

Added to this event was the unveil¬ 
ing of the window to the “Good Shep¬ 
herd,” a contribution of the general 
congregation which* was accomplished 
with dramatic effect 

The beautiful new church, which 
would be a credit to any denomination 
in Los Angeles, was well filled with 
friends of the Washington family and 
many who had known Biddy Mason. 
The choir rendered music, and the in¬ 
vocation led off with a send-off for the 


Mayor—sort of advance announcement, 
as it were—in which the petitioner 
said: “We bless Thee, dear Lord, for 
a Mayor who don’t feel above the citi¬ 
zens of this town and who is willing 
to come down among us and to speak 
well of ns.” (Hearty amens from the 
brethren.) 

Attorney Charles Pr Lee, a colored 
man who wa e * recently admitted to the 
bar here, presided, and after briefly 
announucing the purport of this me¬ 
morial meeting, he gracefully introduced 
Mayor Snyder. 

With all the ease of one used to 
speaking from the pulpit, Mr. Snyder 
at once put his hearers in a pleasant 
frame of mind by referring to his con¬ 
nection with the Methodist denomina¬ 
tion. 

WHAT THE MAYOR SAID. 

“I am not a stranger in a Methodist 
church,” said the Mayor. “I was brought 
up in the Methodist church and have 
always attended one. If I have any 
good in me today, the credit is due to 
the Methodist church and the instruc¬ 
tions I received under its teachings in 
my youth. 

“I am very glad of this opportunity 
to take part in this service. I am not 
a minister, but in this beautiful new 
temple, just being opened, I want to 
say a word, and that is, that when a 
church is once dedicated to the wor¬ 
ship of Almighty God, it should never 
be used for any other purpose. (Amens 
from all parts of the house.) 

“I believe it is fitting for me to be 
here today, as the Mayor of this citv, 
to encourage you in your great work( 
and to pay my tribute to the good 
woman whose memory you honor today. 

“The work being done by this insti¬ 
tution is far-reaching, immeasurable. 
We have to look to the church for the 
sustaining power of the best citizen¬ 
ship. It was through the influence of 
religion that the very liberty we enjoy 
today was brought about, through the 
action of the Pilgrim Fathers, and it 
was through the activity of the church 
that the sentiment for equal rights 
was sustained in America. 

“/ sometimes feel that the church of 
Christ does not feel its power . If it is 
directed wholly for the benefit of hu¬ 
manity, and teaches Christ's love for 
man, it will be invincible, and must 
succeed; but it must not trifle with its 
duty. 

“Be faithful to this good cause. If 
a question arises as to right or wrong 
in your personal conduct, do not act 
until your conscience is fully satisfied. 
When you have a clear conscience you 
may be satisfied that the Lord is not 
displeased with what you have done. 

“Nearly twenty-three years ago it 
was my privilege to first meet Biddy 
Mason, or ‘Aunt Biddy,’ as we all 
loved to call her. I had come from the 
home of the colored people, and for 
some purpose my employer sent me to 
see Aunt Biddy Mason. The kindly, 
cheerful greeting of this good soul 










THE LIBERATOR. 


3 


made me feel almost that I was again 
at my old home. 

“She was a good ^ woman, and you 
are fully justified in today honoring 
her memory with this memorial win¬ 
dow. There are many lessons to he 
learned from the life of this good 
woman. One of these is the important 
one that we must strive against self¬ 
ishness , the monster which you must 
fight at every point. 

“Her. life was an effort for others. 
Like Biddy Mason, let us so order our 
conduct that people in contact with us 
may not forget us, and that our mem¬ 
ories and deeds may shine forth as 
bright as the evening star. When we 
are called on to go hence and the tomb 
awaits these mortal bodies, then may 
o.ur brothers and sisters say of us, as 
they say of her, ‘He was a good man; 
she was a good woman/ ” 

Mayor Snyder closed his address 
with hearty congratulations to the col¬ 
ored people upon acquiring such a 
church property, and expressing the 
wish that its influence for good citizen¬ 
ship and for Christian culture would 
constantly increase. 

Rev. C. H. Anderson, pastor of the 
Second Baptist Church, paid a tender 
tribute to the life and influence of 
Biddy Mason, and stated that she was 
the first contributor to the building of 
the first colored Methodist church here 
years ago, having donated $500 to that 
cause. 

Attorney John W. Kemp, who was in 
charge of the legal affairs of the Biddy 
Mason estate, also spoke in glowing 
terms of the character of this woman, 
whose influence seems to have touched 
so many lives, and dwelt upon the 
nobility of her character. 

Mr. Kemp said that the career of 
Biddy Mason was in many respects 
remarkable; and that, born a slave, 
and hampered with many restrictions, 
she had succeeded in amassing a prop¬ 
erty that was valued at more than 
$100,000. “Yet it is not for this prop¬ 
erty, but her i>weet, helpful Christian 
character that Biddy Mason is remem¬ 
bered,” declared Mr. Kemp. “Pioneers 
all praise her life of good deeds, rais¬ 
ing the fallen and helping her race by 
practical aid and sterling example. Her 
life has been an inspiration to many, 
and it is meet.that it be commemorated 
by this memorial window.” 

VENERABLE CHURCH BUILDER. 

Then came one of the picturesque 
features of the day. Chairman Lee in¬ 
troduced to the congregation a white- 
haired patriarch, Rev. Peter Green, 
who stands to the colored Methodists 
of California in somewhat the same 
relation that the venerable Moses of 
old did to the children of Israel. 
Father Green has been a presiding eld¬ 
er in the church as far back as anyone 
can remember. His religion is of that 
the heart and the hands. In the early 
practical kind that makes use of both of 
these he began to labor with the scat¬ 
tered colored people of California, and 
had as his parish the whole coast from 


San Diego to Washington. With his 
own . hands Father Green built 
churches at Marysville, Stockton, Red 
Bluff, and Virginia City; and he was 
the moving spirit in establishing the 
work in Los Angeles. When the Meth¬ 
odists were ready to dedicate the new 
church their thoughts reverted to this 
venerable father in Israel, who had 
started tile work, and the kindly idea 
was carried out of sending for him to 
come down from Martinez, Contra Cos¬ 
ta county, to participate with them in 
the enjoyment of the beautiful new 
structure. 

Bent with the weight of years, and 
with a voice so weakened that those in 
the rear of the auditorium could only 
now and . then catch a word, the old 
man detailed the struggles of early 
days, and the love, of Biddy Mason for 
the church of Christ, not only her own 
denomination, but the great body of 
those who served the Lord. With tears 
streaming down his face, he pointed 
first to the picture of the woman, 
which stood on a draped easel on the 
platform, and then to. the memorial 
window, and although his words were 
unheard, the actions of the man were 
eloquence itself. 

The memorial window was formally 
presented to the church by Mr. Lee 
and was accepted by the pastor, Rev. 
J. E. Edwards, who also spoke of the 
main memorial window to the Good 
Shepherd, and as he referred to it the 
cloth which had hidden its beauty 
was dropped, and the picture of the 
sheperd and the lambs was presented. 

The congregation with one accord 
began the recitation of the shepherd 
psalm, with beautiful effect, the words 
rolling out with volume: “The Lord 
is my shepherd, I shall not want,” ect., 
and the organ played softly during the 
recitation. It was a fitting climax to 
a unique service. 

THE MASON ESTATE. 

Among the properties of the Biddy 
Mason estate are the business houses 
of Nos. 331, 333 and 335 South Spring 
street, two-story brick blocks erected 
by Mrs. Mason in the early ’8os. She 
left her property to her two daughters, 
Mrs. Ellen Huddleston and Mrs. Har¬ 
riet Washington. 

Biddy Mason was born a slave and 
came to California in 1851, with twenty 
other slaves. Her master feared the 
sentiment of the Pacific Coast, and en¬ 
deavored to take his slaves back to 
Georgia with him. 

Through the continued efforts of 
Robert Owen, Sr., the pitiable cases 
of these slaves was carried through 
all the courts, and finally Judge Hayes 
granted them their freedom.—Times, 
March 6th. 

* * * 

The wealthy negro whose wealth does 
not furnish employment for members of 
his race, is a shabby, worthless negro. 
He is worse than a good-for-nothing 
negro. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

There can be no better proof of the 
rocky path over which the negro news¬ 
paper man has to travel than the fact 
that three capitalists and our captain 
could not muster cash and courage 
enough to get out more than one edi¬ 
tion of the Pacific Coast Monthly Mag¬ 
azine. 


ANDREW CARNEGIE ON THE 
RACE PROBLEM. 

“Now, the wise policy seems obvious. 
We should agree that the keeping down 
of millions of people, even if successful, 
would be destructive to civilized so¬ 
ciety, and a menace to the State. To 
treat them as if they had already risen 
would be equally so; therefore, an edu¬ 
cational test for the suffrage should be 
adopted and strictly applied, applicable 
to whites and blacks alike, for ignorance 
in the whites is deplorable. There is 
only one way to make satisfactory mem¬ 
bers of society, whether white or black, 
and that is, through education in the 
widest sense.”—Mr. Andrew Carnegie, 
addressing the meeting in the interest of 
Hampton Institute, held in the Madison 
Square Garden Concert Hall, February 
12, 1904.

Since the death of the Pacific Coast

even hinted that they think the Captain

is for editing a magazine. It is a good 
thing to tie up to men with a pull, even 

if it is a down pull.

MOB VIOLENCE INCREASING. 

The burning of Hobart and wife at 
the stake in Mississippi and Bays in 
Arkansas, all colored, on murder charge 
and the recent outrage at Springfield, 0 ., 
are evidence of a disregard for law not 
witnessed in any other civilized coun¬ 
try on earth. In neither case was there 
the slightest chance of the victims es¬ 
caping the full penalty of the law, if 
guilty. ' Hobart killed Eastland while 
the latter was trying to kill him. Ho¬ 
bart’s wife had nothing to do with the 
killing and was charged with no of¬ 
fense whatever. She was burned alive 
after being shockingly tortured. Three 
other negroes were killed in cold blood 
by the mob. For a similar killing Bays 
was burned at the stake in Arkansas, in 
his father’s yard in the presence of his 
family. The father and mother were 
compelled to see their son slowlv burned 
alive. While crimes like the above are 
being committed in broad daylight in 
the South, without protest from the 
church or state, the outbreak in Ohio 
is not to be wondered at. If a mob can 


burn an innocent negro woman at the 
stake in Mississippi, without even a 
protest from those iti power in the State 
and nation, the lawless element of the 
white population in Ohio or anywhere 
else in this country can amuse them¬ 
selves by pumping lead into the body 
of a negro man charged with killing a 
white man. The application of the torch 
to homes of innocent negroes by the 
mob was done with no more fear of pun¬ 
ishment than the boy who applies a 
lighted match to a bunch of firecrackers. 

The growing disregard for the ne¬ 
gro’s constitutional rights in this country 
is due mainly to two things: First Is the 
nullification of his rights by Southern 
Legslatures and by the acton of the Unit¬ 
ed States Supreme Court in declaring 
constitutional these revolutionary enact¬ 
ments. If the negro appeals to that 
august body when denied his constitu¬ 
tional rights ,his case is dismissed for 
want of jurisdiction, and he is told to 
appeal to Congress; if Congress passes 
laws for his protection, this same court 
declares them unconstitutional. From the 
above it can be seen that the United 
States Supreme Court has done its full 
share in increasing mob violence as 
practiced upon the negroes. As a re¬ 
sult, there is an increasing contempt for 
all laws; crimes of every kind are on 
the increase, life is daily becoming cheap¬ 
er, and American civilization a stench 
in the nostrils of the Turk. 


Elsewhere in these calumns will be 
found the speech of Mayor Snyder, de¬ 
livered at the dedication of a window to 
the memory of Mrs. Biddy Mason by 
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Washington. In 
that speech the Mayor said many things 
the colored people can remember wjth 
profit. The Mayor is a man of destiny 
and may yet be Governor of this State. 
He has ably served the city three times 
as Mayor and is prominently mentioned 
for a fourth term. He is the first man to 
be three times elected Mayor, and as 
such welcomed two Presidents of the 
United States to the city.

UNPRECEDENTED SALES. 

The sales of the industrial edition of 
The Liberator were entirely beyond our 
most sanguine expectations. Almost 
before the forms had returned from 
the pressman the first edition, though a 
large one, had been exhausted and a 
second one ordered. The sale of the 
second edition continues unabated and 
will soon be exhausted. Its circulation 
covered the entire country and parts of 
Europe and has added many names to 
our subscription list covering every sec¬ 
tion of the country. 

We are under many obligations to 
Messrs. G. W. Snell, Thomas William¬ 
son, Charles Oliver and friends in San 
Francisco for valuable services render¬ 
ed. Those desiring copies should order 
them at once. Rooms 213 and 214, Wil¬

SUPPLEMENT 


A SPLENDID SHOWING. 

Same weeks ago The Herald called 
attention to the fact that the colored 
citizens of Los Angeles were making a 
fine record in the way of material prog¬ 
ress; that they included among their 
number business and professional men, 
tradesmen, mechanics; in short, that the 
colored man was by no means confin¬ 
ing his attention to whitewashing, sew¬ 
er digging, porter’s work and similar 
menial occupations. 

The half was not told. The current 
number of the Liberator is a revelation 
of colored industry and progress. Pub¬ 
lisher Edmonds presents handsome half¬ 
tones and write-ups of more than a 
score of well-established businesses and 
there are doubtless many more besides 
these. 

On the first page is presented a pic¬ 
ture of the First A. M. E. church with 
a membership of over 400, costing 
$25,000. Among the business houses 
are several real estate and rental firms, 
doctors, stove and hardware stores, gro¬ 
cery, butcher shop, crockery store, bar¬ 
ber shop; stenographer and typewriter, 
van and storage, newspaper, hotels and 
lodging houses, dentist, furniture store, 
blacksmith shop, fruit and vegetable 
store, all owned and operated by col¬ 
ored men and women. Pictures are al¬ 
so presented of several homes belong¬ 
ing to colored men that are a credit to 
the community. 

The Herald heartily congratulates the 
negroes of Los Angeles upon the splen¬ 
did showing they are making, and Pub¬ 
lisher Edmonds upon the acumen and 
good judgment that resulted in such a 
notable edition of the Liberator. It 
would also repeat its previously ex¬ 
pressed conviction that the colored men 
and women who are thus advancing 
themselves and their race are troubled 
by no personal race problem; that when 
they show^ a disposition to “do things” 
in a material way they find few obstacles 
placed in their way; that opportunity 
presents itself to the negro no less than 
to the white man, and that fortune’s 
smiles are no less generously bestowed. 
—The Herald. 

ENTERPRISE OF COLORED PEO¬ 
PLE. 

The Liberator, a monthly paper pub¬ 
lished by J. L. Edmunds for the ad¬ 
vancement of the interests of the col¬ 
ored race in Southern California, has 
just issued a handsomely illustrated 
edition of twenty pages, showing the 
progress the colored people are making 
in Los Angeles in a business way and 
in securing homes. The interiors of 
several pretentious business establish¬ 
ments are shown, and there is a fine 
array of handsome residences, all of 
them owned by colored people. The Lib¬ 
erator is preaching practical sermons 
to the colored people in emphasizing 
the need of saving their wages and in¬ 
vesting them in homes of their own. 

—The Times. 


The February edition of the Liber¬ 
ator eclipses all previous efforts of that 
enterprising journal. It is a gem in its 
every feature. The reading matter is 
entertaining and instructive. The me¬ 
chanical part is tastily “made up” and 
the cuts are pleasing to the eye and en¬ 
couraging to the heart of every one 
who is interested in the signal success 
of the negro citizen in Los Angeles. We 
are sure that this illustrative issue of 
the Liberator has been an eye-opener to 
many who walk our streets daily un¬ 
aware of the steady advance of our 
people.—The Enterprise.

Angeles. He is an old Mississippian and 
friend of Bruce and Lynch. 

Mrs. L. L. Stewart spent several days 
here as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Ed¬ 
monds. The change from the city to our 
warm salt ocean air proved very bene¬ 
ficial to her. 


Messrs. E. M. and Theodore Brooks 
of Natchez, Miss., brothers of Mr. C. 
W. Brooks of that city, who recently 
purchased five acres of valuable lands at 
this place, are guests at the Edmonds 
Villa. Mr. Brooks has commenced the 
erection of a modern cottage on the 
property. It will be, when completed, 
one of the neatest cottages in the village. 
The Brookses are all carpenters and men 
of means. Mr. E. M. Brooks has been 
engaged in the shoe business and says 
that he knows more about shoes than 
house building. That these gentlemen 
are enterprising and far-seeing is shown 
by their Sawteile investment. The whole 
family, consisting of six persons, will 
come here to live. Gov. Vardaman is 
putting in his work. Vardaman and his 
kind are driving from the South its 
most desirable colored citizens—men of 
intelligence and enterprise and means. 
We have here in California plenty of 
room for men of the Brooks stamp. 


REV. C. H. ANDERSON. 


When we say that Rev. C. H. Ander¬ 
son is in many respects the foremost col¬ 
ored minister on the Pacific Coast a 
statement is made that those who know 
him will verify. He is not only fore¬ 
most as a church builder, but as a home 
builder and a worthy citizen. .While 
looking after the moral well-being of 
his -people, he has not forgotten their 
temporal welfare. He is broad, progres¬ 
sive, enterprising and teaches by exam¬ 
ple as well as by word. He believes the 
people who own their homes and depend 
upon themselves make better Christians 
than the dependent and shiftless.. The 
colored settlement at Vineland is the 
result of his efforts to better the condi¬ 
tion of his followers by securing homes 


for them where they can be self-sup¬ 
porting. He is leader of the movement 
by the Western Baptist Association to 
found an “Old Folks’ Home” for old 
and dependent colored people. This has 
the support of the entire Baptist denom¬ 
ination and bids, fair to succeed, as Rev. 
Anderson and his people always do. 

On his lot, corner New Jersey street 
and Evergreen avenue, he is erecting a 
handsome building, a store below and a 
flat above. The Second Baptist Church, 
of which Rev. Anderson is pastor, is the 
largest colored congregation in the city. 
The old church being too small, they 
will soon commence the erection of a 
new church, corner Fourteenth and Pa- 
loma streets to cost $30,000. 


SAWTELLE. 

This coming little city has been ho.n* 
ored in the past month by several dis¬ 
tinguished colored visitors, who are look¬ 
ing over Southern California for busi¬ 
ness opportunities. Mrs. Fannie Mitch¬ 
ell of Wilberforce, Ohio, and Mrs. Jas. 
M. Vena of Los Angeles were pleasant 
and interested visitors. .After being 
driven through the beautiful Soldiers* 
Home grounds and other places of inter¬ 
est by the editor of this iournal. lunch¬ 
eon was served at the Edmonds Villa. 
After which the party was driven to San¬ 
ta Monica, where they boarded a car 
fo,* the city. The rain prevented the 
ladies from visiting the Sawteile straw¬ 
berry fields, where strawberries are 
shipped to the market 365 days in ^the 
year. To see ripe tomatoes on the vines 
and cabbages, peas and potatoes all 
growing in the open air in the month of 


February was quite a contrast to the 

snow and ice Mrs. Mitchell had left in 
Ohio. With Madames Mjtchell and 
Vena came one of the biggest rains 
Sawteile. has received during the sea¬ 
son. Visitors to Sawteile are always wel¬ 
come, especially of the Mitchell-Vena 
and rain sort. 

* * * 

Mr. L. N. Sessions was also o pleasant 
visitor. He found us at the plow. After 
luncheon we turned the faithful old 

horse to grass, as Mr. Sessions preferred 
to stay close to soil to better examine It. 
We took him for a walk through the 
gardens and berry fields. Like all vis¬ 
itors to this nlad of Goshen, he was sim¬ 
ply delighted with its soil and products. 
Mr. Sessions is the husband of Mrs. L. 
N. Sessions, a distinguished scholar and 
educator, who recently settled in Los 


Prof. Booker T. Washington’s appeal 
to the South and the country for the 
suppression of mob violence and the 
distribution of equal and exact justice 
to all is both patriotic and manly. But 
we fear that his appeal to the South is 
in vain. In all probability history in 
this case will repeat itself. The South 
may have to have another Appomattox. 
This country has never done anything 
for the negro except what it has. been 
forced to do for its own preservation. 

Bishop Lee’s lecture on the “Old and 
New Negro,” delivered at the First A. 
M E. Church, paid handsomely every 
person who heard it. It was indeed the 
gospel of work, the gospel of good char¬ 
acter, the gospel of right living, of self- 
respect, of doing something and being 
something. Bishop Lee is the most prac¬ 
tical of the A. M. E. Bishops that we 
Viuve had the good fortune to meet, 
Bishop Turner excepted. The. gospel 
preached bv Bishops Lee and Clinton is 
the kind that the masses of the colored 
people need. It is the Booker Washing¬ 
ton gospel—a gospel that fits a man for 
dying by first fitting him for living. 


LOCAL ITEMS. 

Mr. R. C. Owens bought of. William¬ 
son Bros.. 327 South Spring street, a 
beautiful Behr piano. The Behr is the 
finest make of pianos. One of them 
graces the parlor of the Waldorf Hotel, 
New York. Mr. W. H. Washington 
called at Williamson Bros, to examine 
and perhaps purchase one of these pop¬ 
ular pianos, hut thpre was not one^ in 
stork, the new shipment not having 
arrived.

Sudden Death of the 
Pacific Coast Montly 
Magazine 

Death Due to an Over Dose of 
Coagulation, 
Interment Private. 

The sudden death of the Pacific Coast 
Monthly, a so-called magazine published 
by R. C. Owens, capitalist, Eugene Wal¬ 
ker, merchant tailor, and J. L. Holt, en¬ 
terprising business man, was a sledge¬ 
hammer blow to the suckers who had 
pungled up a dollar each for a monthly 
description of charming female peepers. 
The end came peacefully at 13 minutes 
past 10 o’clock a. m., February 13. Its 
demise marks the premature busting of 
another fake bubble—another scheme to 
get something for nothing, has petered 
out and left its promoters in the condi¬ 
tion of Aesop’s frog, whose carcass was 
wrecked by overinflation. 

It was' an immense wind castle. Cap¬ 
tain Crumbly, whose experience, makes 
him an authority on scintillating fe¬ 
male optics, was put in charge. With 
hearts for trumps he was to corral all 
of the women by flashy descriptions of 
female charms. With all of the wom¬ 
en on his string, the conquest of the 
outwitted men would be a mere trifle. 
And the other little negro editors—well, 
thev would be forgotten. 

With visions of endless banquets flow¬ 
ing with red w'ine and sparkling cham¬ 
pagne, with scores of charming women 
in hair-pulling rivalry, for an opportu¬ 
nity to bask in his smile; with, undying 
fame beckoning from every wind that 
blew, “Cap” took up his pen with the 
eagerness of one bent on earning his 
"grub stake.” Cap nibbed it on thick; 
so thick that it took every word in the 
old “blue back speller” to describe the 
paralyzing charms of one or two dark¬ 
eyed beauties. This put all the other 
women on the war path and poor Cap s 
goose was cooked. Instead of smiles, 
his horizon was dark with female 
frowns. There is nothing so blighting 
as a woman’s frown. Having , staked 
everything on one roll of the dice and 
lost, Cap looked as crestfallen as a 
boy whose popping cracker busted when 
he was lighting it. 

After Cap had distributed fifty or a 
hundred copies of the journalistic .freak 
bound in flaming red covers in imita¬ 
tion of the muslin used bv the old Dutch 
kidnapers, the owner of the would-be 
journal, the chief moguls, rode about 
the city with an air of importance 
eaualed only by the eagle man when 
mounted on horseback in a fiesta pa¬ 
rade. They rode forth like conquerors 
reviewinsr the spoils of conquest,, only 
to find th*t they were the spoils—the 
victims of a costly self-coagulation. 
After visitng the barber shops to see 


what they could hear of their publica¬ 
tion and finding it lying around like an 
old last year’s almanac, they returned 
to their rendezvous in the condition a 
ballooon that had just finished its jour¬ 
ney. The See me? air that had previous¬ 
ly pervaded the atmosphere around 
them had departed forever. People are 
no longer compelled to get off the side¬ 
walks to pass them. 

After ascertaining the extent of the 
ruin that had overtaken their ambition, 
a secret council was called, to which the 
supining, cringing editor was sum¬ 
moned. As soon as the full extent of the 
casualties were known the editor was 
flung onto the mercies of a mob of an¬ 
gry women with no hope of appeasing 
their wrath hv less select “write-ups” in 
his next edition. 

While there are a diversity of opinions 
as to the cause of its death, all are agreed 
that wind babv is dead. 

Aside from the four principal mourn¬ 
ers there are a few wet nurses who have 
been sucked to the tune of one dollar 
apiece for subscription. Peace to its 
ashes and charity for its daddies . 


THE NEGRO’S RIGHT TO JURY 
REPRESENTATION. 

The statement which follows has 
been prepared by Mr. Wilford H. 
Smith, attorney-at-law, 150 Nassau St, 
New York. Mr. Smith, it will be re¬ 
membered, had charge of the Dan Rog¬ 
ers case which came up from Alabama 
and which was recently decided by the 
United States Supreme Court,, and al¬ 
so of the Seth Carter case, which came 
up from Texas, both of which cases 
were decided in compliance with the 
contention made to give negroes of the 
country the unquestioned right to be 
represented upon juries and not to be 
discriminated against when members of 
the race are on trial. It is stronglv 
urged that our people insist through 
their attorneys upon this right to be 
represented upon juries in all cases 
where their interests are at stake. It is 
further urged that the information con¬ 
tained in this circular be circulated as 
widely as possible through the agency 
of the press, the pulpit, and in all ways 
where it will reach the masses of the 
negro people. 

To the Colored People of the South: 

The Supreme Court of the United 
States has decided in the recent cases 
of Rogers vs. Alabama, and Carter vs. 
Texas, that the exclusion of qualified 
negroes from jury service on .grand 
and petit juries on account of their race 
and color, is a denial to negroes, on.trial, 
in courts where such exclusion 1 is al¬ 
lowed, the equal protection of the law; 
and the trial and conviction of a negro 
under such circumstances will be. set 
aside and annulled, as being in viola¬ 
tion of the 14th amendment of the Con¬ 
stitution of the United States. The 
same is also true in a civil court,, and. a 
verdict against a negro in a civil, trial 
in a court where such discrimination is 
allowed, will be set aside on appeal or 


writ of error to the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 

You should avail yourselves of the 
benefit of these decisions by moving to 
quash all indictments and panels of petit 
juries in criminal and civil cases, in 
courts where competent members of 
your race are excluded from jury ser¬ 
vice. If the community in which you 
live, or the court in which you are tried 
is not willing t.o concede representation 
on the juries to the competent of your 
race, which is a right guaranteed by the 
Federal Constitution, there can be very 
little reason to hope that your case will 
be fairly and impartially considered in 
such a community or by such a court. 

In most communities in the South you 
have no representation in the making 
of the law, and for that reason you 
should not fail to avail yourselves of 
your right to have a voice in its admin¬ 
istration. You are so vitally affected in 
your lives, liberty and property by the 
law and its administration, that you 
should not be willing to give up all 
right to representation in these , mat¬ 
ters even to your most trusted friends. 

Then, too, it tends to bring upon the 
American negro the scorn and con¬ 
tempt of the foreign clement from ev¬ 
ery land, when they come into commu¬ 
nities where negroes are in large num¬ 
bers, claiming to be American citizens, 
and yet find that they have no voice in 
law-making bodies, nor in the courts of 
the country. 

This is no contention for social equal¬ 
ity, but for manhood rights under the 
law, which you neglect with safety to 
the liberties of yourselves and your 
children. 


A PROTEST AGAINST THE BURN¬ 
ING AND LYNCHING OF 
NEGROES. 

BY BOOKER T. WASHINGTON. 

(The following letter was originally 
printed in the Birmingham Age-Herald, 
Monday, February 29, 1904, and was also 
sent out by the Associated Press to the 
newspapers of the country:) 

Within the last fortnight three mem¬ 
bers of my race have been burned at the 
stake; of these one was a woman. Not 
one of the three was charged with any 
crime even remotely connected with the 
abuse of a white woman. In every case 
murder was the sole accusation. All of 
these burnings took place in broad day¬ 
light and two of them occurred on Sun¬ 
day afternoon in sight of a Christian 
church. 

In the midst of the nation’s busy and 
prosperous life few, I fear, take time to 
consider where these brutal and inhu¬ 
man crimes are leading us. The custom 
of burning human beings has become so 
common as scarcely to excite interest or 
attract unusual attention. 

I have always been among those who 
condemned in the strongest terms crimes 
of whatever character committed by 
members of my race, and I condemn 
them now with equal severity; but I 
maintain that the only protection of our 











THE UIERATOR. 


civilization is a fair and calm trial of 

t l .v pe i 0p e . charg , ed with vrimc and in 
tlieir legal punishment if proved guilty. 

here is no shadow of excuse for de- 
parture from legal methods in the cases 
Of individuals accused of murder. The 

^ i rU,e made ^ the White 
th ^ r execution is in the 
hands °f the white people; so that there 
is little probability of any guilty colored 
man escaping. 

These burnings without a trial are in 
the deepest sense unjust to my race; but 
it is not this injustice alone which stirs 
my heart. These barbarous scenes, fol- 
lowed, as they, are, by publication of the 
shocking details are more disgraceful 
and degrading to the people who inflict 
the punishment than those who receive 

If the law is disregarded when a ne¬ 
gro is concerned, it will soon be dis¬ 
regarded when a white man is con¬ 
cerned; and, besides, the rule of the 
mob destroys the friendly relations which 
should exist between the races and in¬ 
jures and interferes with the material 
Pr ?* S r Perity the corr, munities concerned. 

. Worst of all these outrages take place 
m communities where there are Christ¬ 
ian churches; in the midst of people who 
have their Sunday schools, their Christ¬ 
ian Endeavor Societies and Young Men’s 
Christian Associations, where collections 
are taken up for sending missionaries to 
Africa and China and the rest of the 
so-called heathen world. 

Is it not possible for pulpit and press 
to speak out against these burnings in 
a manner that shall arouse a public sent¬ 
iment that will compel the mob to cease 
insulting our courts, our Governors and 
legal authority; cease bringing shame 
and ridicule upon our Christian civili¬ 
zation ?
