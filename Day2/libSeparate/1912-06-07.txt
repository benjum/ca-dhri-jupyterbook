Imperial Valley to Receive $3,500,000 
for Her Barley Crop 


Imperial V-alley Will Receive 
Three and One-half Million Dol¬ 
lars for the Season’s Crop. 


IMPERIAL, May 31.—The lar¬ 
gest barley crop that has ever 
been raised in Imperial Valley 
is now being harvested, and is 
selling at from $1.50 to $1.55 per 
hundred. The crop now being har¬ 
vested approximates 100,000 acres, 
which is producing thirty-eight to 
forty-five bushels to the acre. This 
means an income from this indus¬ 
try of the great Imperial Valley 
of $3,500,000, or $140 apiece for 
every man, woman and child resi¬ 
dent of the valley. 

Barley is but one of the minor 
industries here, as tw o crops can 
be grown a season on the same 
acreage. Following the harvest¬ 
ing of the barley the land will 
be prepared and corn planted. 
This when harvested will produce 
approximately the same as the 
barley crop, 100,000 acres produc¬ 
ing forty-five bushels to the acre. 
When the corn is harvested, bar¬ 
ley will be planted again and 100,- 
000 or more animals will be turned 
in on this acreage and fattened for 
the winter markets. This also 
brings a large revenue to the ranch¬ 
er. 

While this remarkable feature 
of Imperial Valley farming is go¬ 
ing on in the lines of raising bar¬ 
ley and corn, millions of dollars 
are coming into the valley for 
fat cattle and hogs, and a like 
sum for cantaloupes, vegetables 
and fruits. This does not include 
the $5000 per day that is paid 
for butter fat and other dairy 
products. 


This season 50,000 acres has 
been planted to alfalfa, with $4,000,- 
000 returns. The alfalfa fields are 
used for grazing, the same as the 
barley fields, during the winter 
season.

A WHITE RAPE FIEND IDENTI¬ 
FIED BY SIX WHITE GIRL 
VICTIMS, AGES NINE 
TO FOURTEEN 
YEARS 


HAD IN HIS POSSESSION 
WHEN ARRESTED NAMES OF 
FIFTY INTENDED VICTIMS. 
ARRESTED ON SIMILAR 
CHARGE THREE YEARS AGO. 
HIS COLOR SAVED HIM. 


Three years ago, James R. Cham¬ 
bers, a white married man, was 
arrested for raping a small white 
girl but owing to the color of his 
skin, his crime as revolting as it 
was, created no excitement. After 
a short detention from his busi¬ 
ness, he was set free to prey upon 
other little girls—which he lost 
no time in doing. 

The crime of raping little white 
girls by his class is so common, 
that the daily papers no longer 
regard it as news, hence no scare 
heads are used to attract public 
attention. In fact, they do every¬ 
thing possible to divert public 
attention from the awful depravity 


of the educated white men who 
commit them. 

This policy has made possible 
fiends like Chambers. It was the 
wholesale manner in which Cham¬ 
bers went into the business that 
forced the daily papers to give 
him unusual advertisement; and 
still, they are far less generous 
to him than they are to a Negro 
charged with one such revolting 
crime. 

Suppose, for instance, that Cham¬ 
bers was a Negro: under scare 
heads, his crime would be published 
in every daily paper in the country,, 
and heralded, abroad, as proof 
of the total depravity of the black 
race. _ It would be urged in jus¬ 
tification of disfranchisement, mob 
violence and all of the outrages 
that cowardice, envy and jealousy 
have heaped upon the defenseless 
Negroes of this country since the 
war. 

The white people are deceiving- 
no one but themselves; its their 
own posterity they are cheating. 

Chambers’s crimes are told in 
part by one of the dailies as fol¬ 
lows: 

“Three years ago Chambers, who 
is employed by a realty company 
in the Union Oil building, was 
arrested for a similar offense. Mrs. 
Chambers, from whom he has 
been seperated for almost three 
years, said yesterday afternoon that 
she got him off at that time. 

“Chambers operated under the 
alias of “Dr. Christy.” He ad¬ 
vertised for a young girl assistant 
in his office. He would visit the 
home of those answering and would 
say he wanted a telephone girl. 
In other instances he pretended 





























TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


that he wanted the girl to go on 
the road in the interest of a medi¬ 
cal concern in which he was in¬ 
terested. As the location for his 
‘offices’ he affected either the San 
Fernando or the Chester building. 

“When searched, a list of more 
than fifty little girls and their 
addresses was found on him. In 
it were the names of the six girls 
he is accused by detectives of 
molesting. 

“Chambers refused to tell where 
he lives. His wife said he roomed 
and boarded ‘somewhere in the 
suburbs,” but could not give the 
exact location. He had no ex¬ 
planation to offer for his conduct 
aside from the statement: 

“ ‘I guess I must be crazy.’ 
“The alleged victims range from 
9 to 14 years of age.” 

HON. JAMES ALEXANDER, 
PRESIDENT OF THE AFRO- 
AMERICAN COUNCIL DE¬ 
NOUNCED-AS A CALIFORNIA 
PIMP. BY MEMBERS OF THE 
A. M. E. GENERAL CONFER¬ 
ENCE. ALL CALIFORNIANS 
INSULTED. 


Mr. James M. Alexander, presi¬ 
dent of the Afro-American Council 
and clerk in the Internal Revenue 
Office, attended the A. M. E. 
General Conference held recently 
at Kansas City. He went there 
to conduct Rev. F. Jesse Peck’s 
campaign for the bishopric. 

His experience, he says was 
exceedingly pleasant. Finding him¬ 
self badly handicaped by not being 
on the “inside,” he decided to buy a 
badge if he could find a venal 
delegate. “This I had no diffi¬ 
culty in doing.” In due time, he 
purchased a badge for $1.50, 
pinned it on his manly breast 
and passed in. “Once on the “in¬ 
side” things were “fixed” and Rev. 
Peck’s election seemed assured. 
Bishop Flipper the presiding bis¬ 
hop was “easy” and everything 
was working like a charm. Rev. 
Peck and his bunch of delegates 
were all smiles with delight, as it 
looked as if there was nothing 
left for him to do but count his 
votes and try on his robe. Just 


then, Bishop C. S. Smith came in 
and raised a big howl. He charged 
Rev. Peck’s friends with buying 
votes; he said goats had gotten 
in among the sheep. In the midst 
of the awful tumult that my pre¬ 
sence had caused a. delegate point¬ 
ing to me said: “there he is, that 
California pimp.” Some one made 
a dash for the presiding bishop; 
in the scramble he smashed his 
gavel. A mighty howl went up 
for the police.” 

Taking advantage of the wild 
commotion, Mr. Alexander left the 
hall. Police came in. The goats 
having disappeared the storm sub¬ 
sided, and like Poe’s “Raven” 
Rev. Peck’s opportunity not to 
be bishop, came to leave him 
“never more.” 

Mr. Alexander is president of 
the Afro-American Council and 
clerk in the LJ. S. Internal Revenue 
Office, “the leading Afro-American 
in this great state.” To have him 
referred to as a pimp is an insult 
to his following, but he does not 
seem to realize the seriousness 
of the reference. Although Mr. 
Alexander seems to regard the 
whole matter as a joke and is 
telling it about town as such, 
the colored people whose leader 
he is, should investigate the charge 
and demand a retraction from the 
member of the Conference guilty 
of that gross insult. Then, too, 
think of referring to members of 
the California delegation as “goats” 
and putting the president of the 
Council on the level with the 
lowest specimen of humanity is 
an insult that his followers 
of this city ought to resent. If 
they hope to enjoy the respect 
of their neighbors, they will have 
to protect their leader from such 
shocking aspersions. 


FOOL’S PARADISE IGNORED 
BY THE BUSINESS MEN 


The Sunday following its real 
estate farce, the Fool’s Paradise 
was set aside for the business men. 
But these gentlemen being readers 
of The Liberator were conspicuous 
for their absence. Knowing the 
caliber of the men who run the 


thing, the business men decided 
to ignore them entirely. 

Only a short time ago, one of 
the leaders struck the Negro busi¬ 
ness men a sneaking blow by 
demanding that they must sell 
groceries cheaper than white 
grocers, if they wanted the Negro 
trade. The envious feeling that 
prompted that suggestion can 
readily be seen. The announce¬ 
ment that the “Business Men’s 
League” would meet there, deceived 
none but the leaders; for it is 
known by everybody, save, per¬ 
haps, the League’s president, that 
that organization has been dead 
for years, so far as the business 
men are concerned. 

Aside from the regular cohorts, 
Mr. J. H. Shackleford was the 
only business man that got trapped. 

Wouldn’t Knock It. 

A gentleman, who is running 
a newspaper somewhere on Cen¬ 
tral Avenue, was called upon and 
made a lengthy spiel promising 
never to knock the Paradise, but 
to boost it no matter what it did. 
The promise, not to “knock” it, 
elicited considerable applause from 
the cohorts. Believing that he 
had made “a hit,” the newspaper 
man made a long call for the 
names of all who* desired to read 
his paper the “Non Knocker.” 
You can imagine his surprise at 
the silence that greeted his spiel 
for support. 

The “F-1 Bulletin,” which 

was caught in a similar trap some 
time ago, did get a promise of 
two subscribers for a month, “if 
it keep runnin’ till nex yeah.” 

The Central Avenue man got 
nothing but grins for his surrender. 
Realizing what- a “sucker” had 
been made of him, he sneaked 
out and left the place on a jump. 
He discovered when too late, why 
The Liberator is so extensively 
read at the Paradise and why 
Negro business and professional 
men, who are not “kids”, give 
the place a wide berth. 

Negro Physicians Slured. 

Last Sunday, while someone 





































THE LIBERATOR 


THRFE 


was talking of the sad plight of 
a young colored girl, confined in 
the County hospital as the result 
of a white man's depravity, it 
was suggested that a colored phy¬ 
sician be sent out there to examine 
her. 

This suggestion brought a man— 
a member of the Paradise—to 
his feet, who asked: “Can you 
find an honest Negro doctor?” 

As insinuating as this question 
was, no one resented it. 

Although aspersions like the 
above are continually cast upon 
respectable business and profes¬ 
sional men of the race, and, in 
spite of the fact, that the leaders 
of the bunch neither endorse nor 
patronize race enterprise, if they 
can help it, they have among their 
members some men who have 
actually been to school. 


CITY BY THE SEA

Miss Mildred Anderson has gone 
to the Adventist Nurse Training 
School at Glendale to take a two 
year’s course. 


Mr. J. I. W. Fisher, a prosperous

both of Monrovia, were in the 
city Sunday. 


THE NEED FOR NEGRO DOC¬ 
TORS 

Among the 9,000,000 Negroes 
of the South only one in 4,000 
is a physician. That can mean 
only one thing—that the bulk 
of the colored population has not 
enough medical attention to keep 
well; for most Negroes do not 
employ white doctors when they 
are ill. And it means also that, 
for lack of teachers, this race is 
lagging behind their neighbors in 
sanitation and in the simpler 
defenses of modern hygiene. For 
this horde of unserved and untaught 
people only seven medical schools 
are provided, of which five are 
worthless, according to the recent 
report of the Carnegie Foundation 
on Medical Education in the United 
States. The remaining two 
schools, however—Howard at 
Washington and Meharry at Nash¬ 
ville—are commended as “worth 
developing.” They offer instruc¬ 
tion that equips their graduates 
for useful and competent service. 
Meharry is open to graduates of 
high schools. Howard sets con¬ 
siderably higher entrance require¬ 
ments—higher, indeed, than the 
requirements of many medical 
schools for white students—-and 
maintains a standard of work that 
has called forth the praise even 
of Dr. William H. Welch and Dr. 
Henry S. Pritchett. 

The students of these schools 
are in deadly earnest. Some of 
them make astonishing sacrifices 
to enable them to continue at 
their work. One of them, for 
example, has said: “For many 
months I lived on a can of pork 
and beans a day. I would have 
pork with beans for breakfast, 
beans and pork for dinner, and at 
night I would wash out the can 
and have bean soup.” Another 
student, who is now a successful 
physician in a Northern city, said: 
“I lived on three dollars a month 
for some time before I graduated. 

I got pretty thin, but I stuck it 
out.” 

The colored physicians who have 
come out of these schools have 
been centers of light and service 


to their race. The need is for 
opportunity greatly to increase 
their number; and it is a crying 
and important need.—World’s 
Work. 

We have in this city four phy¬ 
sicians, all men of character and 
ability, but they are somewhat 
negligent regarding the real wel¬ 
fare of the race. They can do 
much to better race conditions by 
lecture on sanitation. As the re¬ 
sult of ignorance of the laws of 
health our doctors and undertakers 
are getting rich; but the youth of 
the race— 

By working in conjunction, our 
ministers and physicians can do 
so much to increase the health, 
happiness and longevity of the 
race.—Ed. 


It looks as if Roosevelt will 
be Brownsvilled at Chicago. There 
will be no third term president 
in our day.

CUBA TO BE AMERICANIZED 


The announcement that the Ne¬ 
groes of Cuba, who are struggling 
for their rights, are to be crushed, 
means that that island is to be 
Americanized by reducing the 
Cuban Negroes to the condition 
of those in the Southern states. 
Under the Spanish rule they were 
Cubans, and all Cubans were 
treated alike But since the Ameri¬ 
cans took a hand in the affairs 
in that country, all is changed. 
Cubans of color who bled and died 
for the freedom of their country, 
owing to American influence, are 


no longer Cubans but Negroes to 
be lynched, if they attempt to 
exercise rights purchased by their 
own blood. Superior brute force 
can crush them, but the force that 
does the crushing will have no 
child’s play.

forced to pay $2,500 for poor

must pay $500 down and $20 per 
month; paying down five times more 
than is required of other people.

DOUBTS THE PROPRIETY OF 
PRESIDENT ALEXANDER’S 
ACTS 


While the followers of Hon. 
Jas. M. Alexander, president of 
Afro-American Council, feel greatly 
incensed at his being referred to 
as a “pimp,” they seriously doubt 
the propriety of his getting into 
the conference by corrupting a 
weak delegate. They regard it 
as wrong to have secured entrance 
to a ward political convention 
by purchasing a venal delegate’s 
badge. 

The episode, doubtless, furnished 
President Alexander considerable 
amusement but it brought disgrace 
upon a great church, put his State 
in bad and put his candidate for 
bishop out of the running for all 
time to come. 


MRS. KELLUM PASSES AWAY 


After an illness of several months, 
Mrs. Kellum, mother of Mrs. C. 


W. Holden, passed away on the 
31st of May. Mrs. Kellum had 
been in poor health for a number 
of years but was able to be about 
until a few months previous to 
her death. For more than a month, 
she was conscious that the end 
was near and requested Rev. Ken- 
chin to come and pray with her 
at regular intervals. She lived 
a Christian’s life and died a Christ¬ 
ian’s death. 

The funeral services, conducted 
by Rev. Kenchin, were held at 
Wesley Chapel on the 3rd. The 
remains were borne to the cemetery 
in a special funeral car. 

There were many beautiful 
floral offerings. 

Mrs. Charlotte McCormick, wife 
of Mr. Wm. McCormick and daugh¬ 
ter of Rev. and Mrs. Scipio Thomp¬ 
son, died suddenly on the 31st 
of May. Mrs. McCormick has 
been a member of the Second Bap¬ 
tist Church since childhood. Rev. 
C. H. Anderson, who baptized her 
and officiated at her wedding, 
conducted her funeral services, as¬ 
sisted by Rev. McCoy. The floral 
offerings were many and beautiful. 

The bereaved families have the 
sympathy of the entire community. 


The First A. M. E. Church was 
well filled on the evening of May 
27th, last, with an appreciative 
and talented audience to hear 
the first Joint Recital by Miss 
Bessie Williams, violinist and Mr. 
John Gray, Pianist, who were 
admirably assisted by Miss Es¬ 
telle Everett, Dramatic Reader; 
Mr. Harold Browning, Tenor; Mr. 
G. Harry Bolden, Baritone; and 
Miss Maurie Moss and Mrs. Wil¬ 
son Vuaghn, accompanists. 

The program was divided into 
two parts and was composed of 
selections from some of the fore¬ 
most composers and writers. 

Those present enjoyed a rare 
treat; and too much praise and 
credit cannot be given Miss Wil¬ 
liams and Mr. Gray for presenting 
such a classic and well rendered 
recital.
