THE LIBERATOR. 


A Negro Town within a 
Town 

A Visit to furlong and 
West Jefferson 

ONWARD AND UPWARD. 

Succinctly states the movement of 
the colored citizens of this city for 
the year just closed. What is true 
of this city is equally true of our peo¬ 
ple in the suburban towns. Many 
homes and much real estate have been 
added to our holdings, and large 
amounts of money have been spent for 
improvements. The year 1905 wit¬ 
nessed tne erection by the colored peo¬ 
ple of hundreds of up-to-date cottages. 
Perhaps in no other city are the col¬ 
ored people so admirably situated as 
they are in this. Having prudently 
refused to segregate, their beautiful 
homes and well-kept grounds are to 
be found on nearly every street, and 
in every quarter of the city. From the 
aristocratic Angeleno Heights to the 
Heights of Pico; from Pico to Boyle 
Heights; from the exclusive Westlake 
district to the no less exclusive West 
* Adams Heights; from the St. James 
Park district the Presbyterian colony, 
to the classic environments of the 
University settlement,—everywhere, 

and on every hand, the negro’s modest 
mansions rise. And in all this vast 
aggregation of wealth and culture the 
only way to find the negro. home, is 
to know his number, for his cottage 
and grounds are as tastefully kept as 
are those of his white neighbors. The 
heathenish cry of “No negro can buy 
in this subdivision,” that is so fre¬ 
quently heard, is a wail from the Var- 
daman element which is mortally dis¬ 
tressed by the progress the negroes 
are making. To see the negro’s mod¬ 
ern cottage and tastily kept grounds 
vieing with those of the white man, 
and to know that his family breathes 
unmolested the sweet odor-laden 
zephyrs as they glide in from the or¬ 
ange groves on their journey from the 
mountains to the sea, almost runs the 
Vardaman element of this fair city 
crazy. The spirit of progress shown 
by the negro wherever given a chance, 
gives the lie to their mouthings about 
his inferiority, retrogression and oth¬ 
er base falsehoods—but it is the liv¬ 
ing, not the dead, we set out to dis¬ 
cuss. 

The Furlong Tract. 

After repeated invitations by Editor 
Greene, Attorney Darden and others, 
accompanied by Capt. Crumbly on De¬ 
cember 25th, we visited the colored 
settlement, known as the “Furlong 


Tract.” This settlement, which is 
within the city is about four miles 
from the court house on the Long 
Beach car line, is superbly located. 
Strictly speaking, it is not a negro set¬ 
tlement, as there are within its bound¬ 
ary four or five white families, and 
hemmed in on every side by cosmo¬ 
politan settlements, the tract lies like 
an island in a peaceful sea. Besides 
a grocery store there is one laundry, 
one hair-dressing and dressmaking es¬ 
tablishment, one real estate and insur¬ 
ance man, Mr. Harry Mitchell; one 
newspaper, editor, Prof. T. A. Greene; 
one lawyer, C. S. Dardin, Esq.; one 
carpenter and builder, Mr. Bronson; 
one church site, given by Banker 
Ralph Rogers—but, strange to say, no 
preacher. „ „ , 

The administration of Furlong, if 
such it may be called, is vested in an 
improvement committee, which looks 
after street improvements, street 
cleaning, shade tree setting and the 
burning of old discarded bedticks and 
other rubbish. The progress made by 
Furlong in the past twelve months has 
been remarkable. While it contains 
many small houses, always to be found 
in new California settlements, it also 
contains many neat modern cotages. 
Mr. Mitchell, real estate man, and one 
of ' the leading spirits, has laid out 
lawn tennis and croquet grounds under 
the giant pepper trees that beautify 
his home site. This has proven a great 
attraction to the colored people of oth¬ 
er sections of the city, who flock there 
in search of rest and innocent amuse¬ 
ment. The hundred-foot boulevard 
from this city to Long Beach passes 
through the tract, which, taken into 
consideration with its situation. and 
the character of men interested in Its 
development, Furlong has a splendi 
future. Mr. W. H. Washington our 
popular real estate man, owns the Fur' 
long grocerv, and has taken a deep in¬ 
terest in the development of the set¬ 
tlement, devoting to it both time and 
money. And last but by no means 
the least, with regard to saloons and 
dives, Furlong is to he a snow white 
district. 

West Jefferson Street. 

Responding to the invitation of Mr. 
A R Wyche, of over a year s stand¬ 
ing, to visit his section and note the 
prosperity of our people there, on the 
afternoon of December 31st. we took 
a West Jefferson car and a half-hour 
ride through homes of unsurpassed 
beauty and loveliness. The car stop¬ 
ped for us at 1299 West Jeffersor 
street the splendid home of Mr.Wyche 

_our 'host. It was a stormy day. A 

wild frosty wind from the snow-cap¬ 
ped ’summits of Sierra’s lofty peaks 
was madly raising dust and rudely 
tossing to and fro orange blossoms, 
call a lilies and geraniums, indiscrimi¬ 
nately scattering such petals that let 
go the parent stem. A touch of the 


electric bell, the door opened, a vacant 
chair before the roaring fire in an open 
fire-place extended an invitation and 
offered a pleasant retreat from the 
disagreeable elements without This 
splendid home situated on a large cor¬ 
ner lot is neat and contains all mod¬ 
ern improvements. Besides this, Mr. 
Wyche owns a six-room cottage which 
he rents to a white family for $30 
per month. His immediate neighbors 
are all white by whom he is highly 
respected. After a short rest, Mr. 
Wyche took us for a walk among the 
neat and attractive homes of our peo¬ 
ple in that prosperous locality. Here 
reside 30 industrious intelligent col¬ 
ored families, whose modest homes 
are scattered over a wide extent of 
thickly settled territory. One remark¬ 
able thing in this connection is, that 
these 30 families own more than 30 
homes. This is a pleasing prospect. 
The home of Mrs. S. H. Poole front¬ 
ing on West 3Gth and Raymond 
streets,is a credit to its locality. At 
1376 we found Mr. Frank Wilkerson 
and lady and spent a few pleasant 
moments with them. Their two-story 
cottage is neatly furnished and has 
every convenience one could desire. 
They own another cottage, rent of 
which yields a good income. 


At the modest well-kept home of 
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cloyd, 1467 W. 
57 th, we met two young ladies remark¬ 
able’ for their physical charms and 
striking resemblance. They were 
Mrs. Cloyd and her daughter, Miss 
Cloyd. 

* * * 

The cozy homes of Messrs. J. C. 
Whitby and F. B. Alexander, 1455 and 
1523 W. 37th street, respectively, were 
visited, where a few pleasant moments 
were spent. Mr. Whitby is doing a 
prosperous transfer business. Mr. Al¬ 
exander is a bright young man popu¬ 
lar in the young people’s church soci¬ 
eties, where he is an ardent worker. 
He is a leading member of the colored 
Presbyterian church, and is a former 
student of Miss Lynch, president of 
the North Carolina Colored W. C. T. 
TJ., and delegate to the late W. C. T. 
U. convention, held in this city. 

* * * 

Mr. W. H. Joyce, a brignt young 
business man, has an up-to-date gro¬ 
cery at 1522 W. 37th street, and is 
doing well. He deserves the patron¬ 
age of our people in that locality, as 
his success will redound to the credit 
of all, and add to the importance of 
the community. 

* * * 

The cottage of Mr. and Mrs. A. 
Simpson, 1558 W. 37th, is the prettiest 
in Us locality. It is new, having been 
completed only a short time, being 
strictly up-to-date in every particu¬ 
lar. Mr. Simpson was absent on our 
arrival, but Mrs. Simpson and her

charming daughter entertained us 
nicely till he arrived, after which dain¬ 
ty refreshments were served. 

* * * 

On our return via Jefferson street, 
we got a glimpse of the commodious 
home of Prof. E. L. Chew. It was too 
late to call. He came here recently 
from Atlanta, Ga. f where he occupied 
a prominent place among the educa¬ 
tors of that city of schools and col¬ 
leges. He is a native of Mississippi, 
where he was reared and educated. 
He came to give his mother, whose 
health is feeble, the benefit of our mild 
climate. Already his presence for good 
has been felt in the community, and he 
is regarded by his neighbors as a valu¬ 
able acquisition. 

* * * 

We called the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
T. B. Norman, 1415 W. 3Gth street, but 
they had left for church. Their home 
is neat and in keeping with its cult¬ 
ured surroundings. From there a 
short walk brought us to the hospit¬ 
able home of Mr. Wyche, where a 
warm fire and a sumptuous dinner 
awaited us. Mrs. Wyche gave us a 
dinner such as only Southern women 
can prepare. Our visit to West Jeffer¬ 
son was one of those that add to the 
length of days by developing the 
brighter side of life. 


lie speaker, his anecdotes were coarse, 
appealing mainly to the baser nature 
of his hearers and degrading to his 
profession. 

But they brought “Bro. Hawkins 
back, and before he got the Eastern 
mud off his heels, he was accused of 
making overtures to get back into the 
M. E. church, attempting to desert 
the men and women who paid his ship¬ 
ping bill. The story of his betrayal of 
his race on the school board nomina¬ 
tion is known to the chagrin of us all. 
Had he been true the race would be 
represented on the school hoard to¬ 
day. We opposed his nomination at 
the convention, believing it to be a 
bad one, but to no avail. He was al¬ 
ways looked upon as a cheap grafter 
and his lining up with the infamous 
old six-bits push proved the truth of 
the conclusion. But we were not pre¬ 
pared to believe that he would rent the 
whole side of the church for $5 to cof¬ 
fee dealers to advertise coffee. Some 
preachers would sell thier tickets to 
heaven if they could find a purchaser. 


The Passing of Rev. S. W. Hawkins. 

The position of the Liberator with 
respect to Rev. Hawkins’ usefulness 
as a minister of the gospel, is too 
well known to be reiterated. That he 
was over estimated and would finally 
drift to his place, we well knew. Sev¬ 
eral years ago he quit the M. E. con¬ 
ference of this state, and cast his lot 
with the Zion A. M. E. connection 
by a special order from heaven._ He 
went East and made a dismal failure, 
as the days of the “end man” are 
over in our Eastern churches. His cry 
of distress was heard by his cohorts 
here and they gave entertainments in 
the church that has just dumped him 
to raise money to ship him back. We 
offered a protest against it at that 
time, but it was a voice in the wild¬ 
erness that went unheeded. 

On that occasion January, 1901, The 
Liberator had the following to say. 

Rev. Hawkins. 

The money raised to ship Rev. Mr. 
Hawkins hack to this city is in our 
judgment a very poor investment. 
What good thing did he do when here 
that makes his return now so neces¬ 
sary? He is remembered here main- 
lv for his failure to grasp opportuni¬ 
ties thrust upon him to elevate him¬ 
self and race. His nomination for 
member of the board of education 
showed how vastly he had been over- 
estimated. His attempt for some triv¬ 
ial consideration to withhold his resig¬ 
nation so as to prevent the parties 
nominating him from filling the vacan¬ 
cy has not been forgotten. As a pub- 


Los Angeles Business and Profession¬ 
al Negro and His Short¬ 
comings. 

No paper has given as much space 
to free advertising of the business and 
professional negroes in this city, as 
has this journal. In fact, we have 
given them ten times more space than 
all of the other negro papers in the 
state combined. What is the result? 
With but a very few exceptions, it has 
not only proven so much energy, time 
and money thrown away, so far as the 
race is concerned, but by increasing 
their business opportunities, have 
made them practically useless to the 
race. Undoubtedly our business and 
professional men here, taken as a 
whole, must he different from those 
in other cities. Like most of us, they 
come here without anything, and 
newspapers of the Liberator make 
gave them a lot of free advertisement 
urging our people to patronize them, 
tor this they are always thankful, and 
as soon as they “get things straight¬ 
ened out” they will put a card in your 
splendid journal.” He is a good fel¬ 
low and believes strongly in encour¬ 
aging race enterprise (his enterprise, 
of course). He goes to all the 
churches, takes a front seat prays 
loud and with a great show puts a 
dollar in the collection. He testifies 
at prayer and league meetings, always 
managing to ring in a word or two 
about his profession. Well, with this 
and his free newspaper advertising, he 
builds up a good patronage. Call upon 
him for his long promised card he tells 
you coldly, brazenly that a card in 
your paper will do him no good. Of 
course he would subscribe for it, but 
he “can't spare the time to read It, 
and therefore to subscribe would be 
throwing away a dollar.” He gets so 
busy that his visits to the negro 


churches grow less and less, and final¬ 
ly cease. Then he goes to a white 
cnurch or go to the theater, go on Sun¬ 
day excursions to the beaches or hang 
around parks the companion poor 
white trash that slip in the back doors 
of his home to spend the evenings 
with his family. Another scheme of 
this class to get away from their race, 
is to suddenly become holy and sancti¬ 
fied. There being no colored holiness 
churches, they are forced to join a 
white church of this faith. Such a 
negro would not be guilty of reading a 
negro paper or going to a negro 
church or patronizing negro enter¬ 
prises. This class Ol negroes belong 
to no race organizations, takes no 
more interest in the race and its strug¬ 
gles for equal rights and fair play 
than the Chinaman does. They keep 
away from the race as much as possi¬ 
ble and contribute nothing if they can 
avoid it, for the support of race 
churches, neswpapers and other enter¬ 
prises. They refused to be identified 
with enterprises looking to a combina¬ 
tion of capital so as to furnish employ¬ 
ment for members of the race, such 
as opening drug stores, department 
stores, banks, building and loan asso¬ 
ciations, hotels, etc., as the same clas3 
does in other cities, with less money 
and less protection of the laws. This 
too in face of the fact that the white 
people here aid us in every laudable 
undertaking. As soon as the class of 
negroes named reach the position 
where they can be of service to their 
race as leaders and examples, they try 
to get away from it. That’s why this 
negro is looked upon as being beneath 
the offscourings of other races. The 
negroes here have $500,000 in non-in¬ 
terest paying banks and vaults of this 
city, the bulk of which is being used 
by white men to build hotels and drug 
stores that refuse to serve negroes. 
This is due to the cowardice, hypoc- 
ricy and dishonesty of the negroes 
named. If Vardaman would confine 
his remarks to this class of negroes 
we could say Amen! 

The working men and women who 
support our churches and other enter¬ 
prises and keep our newspapers in a 
position to manufacture sentiment in 
favor of fair play for the race, must 
blacklist this infamous gang of trait; 


Tbe negroes of this city are suffer¬ 
ing from an over-dose of materialism 
in the direction of hanking money. 
They are piling up money in white 
men’s banks to be used to build fac¬ 
tories and other establishments that 
refuse them employment. They have 
$500,000 in banks that yield them no 
financial influence whatever. It does 
not give them a single bank clerk.

THE EMANCIPATION OBSERVED. 

The celebration of the Emancipa¬ 
tion Proclamation was greeted by a 
small audience at Wesley Chapel on 
the first. But what was lacking in 
numbers was made up in enthusiasm. 
The program was a splendid one, 
splendidly rendered, and the absent 
ones were great losers. The speech 
by Prof. J. C. Moore orator of the 
evening was one of the finest ever 
delivered. Addresses were made by 
Madames Stovall and Moxley. Mrs. 
Stovall's address was one of the main 
features of the evening, and those who 
heard it declared that Mrs. Stovall as 
a platform speaker has no equal 
among the colored women of the state. 

At Pasadena a crowded house greet¬ 
ed a broken program. Many persons 
whose names were on the program 
failed to appear. The master of cere¬ 
monies did not put in his appearance 
till 8:40, the audience waiting in sus¬ 
pense fully an hour. Besides a large 
number of gray-haired veterans of 
the Civil War, who occupied front 
seats there were many white people 
scattered throughout the big audience. 
Addresses were delivered by Rev. G. 

R. Bryant, orator of the evening; the 
editor of this journal, anu by the mas¬ 
ter of ceremonies, who made many 
long speeches, delivering one on the 
announcement of each part of the pro¬ 
gram. In spite of this, much enthus¬ 


iasm was manifested by the audience, 
and all went home happier for the 
evening’s exercise.

Atrocious Crime in Texas. 

Texas seems to be determined to 
lead in the matter of fiendish crimes. 
The following telegraphic report ex¬ 
plains itself: 

Paris, Tex., Dec. 14. — A band of 
armed and mounted whitecaps visited 
the home of a man named Asa Flood, 
near Glory, Tex., this morning between 
midnight and day, and murdered him 
by first shooting him and then cutting 
his head off. 

After killing Flood, the whitecaps 
fired several times at his wife, who 
had rushed to him when she heard the 
first shot, and wounded her fatally, 
leaving her lying across her husband’s 
body. 

About a half hour before the visit 
of the whitecaps a man named Allen 
Young, returning home late from Glo¬ 
ry, was passed on the road by a band 
of mounted men, who rode close to¬ 
gether with their faces masked. Mr. 
Young thought nothing of this circum¬ 
stance until he learned of murder 
this morning, although he could give 
no clew to the identity of the men by 
whom he was passed. 

Mrs. Flood was still alive when 
found this morning, and able to give 
an account of the murder. She said 
that Flood had heard a noise about 
the woodpile, and went out to investi¬ 
gate it. Hardly had he reached the 
spot when she heard what sounded to 
her like a volley of musketry. She 
sprang out the door and stumbled 
over her husband’s body, then heard a 
crash and knew no more until morn¬ 
ing. 

A bloody ax was found near the 
woodpile. It is thought it was used 
in cutting off the colored man’s head. 
Flood’s wife was a half-breed In¬ 
dian, while he was the man who had 
a difficulty with a white man on the 
streets of Paris last Saturday and who 
fled, pursued by a mob. He had been, 
in hiding since that time. 


The Broadway Department Store 
employs eleven colored persons, and 
advertises in colored papers. How is 
that for a “square deal?” Every moth¬ 
er’s son of our 8,000 to 10.000 negroes 
should trade there. KEEP AWAY 
FROM STORES WHERE NO NE¬ 
GROES ARE EMPLOYED. Merch 
ants who want negro patronage will 
advertise in Negro papers. 

* * * 

Capt. F. H. Crumbly has qualified 
a.s a notary public. He is a worthy, 
capable gentleman, and deserves a 
good patronage. Call an^ see him and 
send your friends, who need his serv¬ 
ices. Office, 243 1 /£ E. Second street.

The negro business man who does 
not advertise is on the business sea 
in a leaky boat, and should keep in 
touch with another job.

COME TO THIS LAND OF SUMMER 
BLOOM. 

(Prom a letter written to an East 
ern friend and copied for the Libera 
tor by the author.) 

’Neath balmy skies of cloudless blue 
I write .this letter unto you, 

Dear friend of yore, so tried and true 

The mocking birds sing sweetly here; 
Oid mission bells ring soft and clear, ’ 
And flowers blossom all the year. 

How are my friends, each one and all. 
There, where wild winter spreads its 
pall. 

And snow and sleet so thickly fall? 

Why shiver in a land of gloom, 

Where winter sounds the knell of 
doom, 

And sweeps the flowers to the tomb. 

Dark land, where blizzards fiercely 
sweep, 

Where nature lies in icy sleep, 

Beneath the snow so cold and’deep. 

Oh, plume your pinions for a flight, 
Away from arctic storms and night. 
To genial regions warm and bright. 

Come to this land of fragrant flowers, 
This land of mystic, fairy bowers, 

This rich, Elysian land of ours. 

Come, where the murmuring sunset 
sea 

Makes sweet, perpetual melody, 

And thrills our lives with ecstasy. 

Come to this land of summer skies— 
This joyous, blossoming paradise— 
Where beauteous landscapes meet the 
eyes. 

Oh, from your frozen regions come, 
And find here an enchanted home, 
Near some majectic dome. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

Attorney P. M. Nash has built up a 
good practice. In view of the fact 
that he has been here less than a 
year his success is all the more re¬ 
markable. He is a graduate of Har¬

ped for his profession.

Miss Susie E, Edmonds has resumed 
her studies at the University of South¬

seems that all of the other colored 
students have dropped out. This is 
indeed regrettable.

sands of white men, women and chil¬ 
dren. How many colored men and 
women are employed by the wealthy 
colored men? 

* * * 

Ah, There! Stricklin. 

Some time ago, under large head 
lines there appeared in the Times the 
announcement that Mr. Hilyard Strick¬ 
lin, a wealthy colored butcher, was go¬ 
ing to build an old folks’ home for 
aged colored men ana women. This 
home was to be free to all for whom 
it was designed to benefit. How it 
was to be built and operated was ex¬ 
plained at length in the Times, tak¬ 
ing up considerable space in that great 
paper. We had our doubts at the 
time about Mr. Stricklin doing any¬ 
thing free or otherwise, for any mem¬ 
ber of his race, except Stricklin, and 
decided to investigate the matter be¬ 
fore saying anything about it in this 
journal. 

Was It a Scheme to Sell a Lot? 

Taking up the investigation, we 
found that no one who knew Stricklin 
pinned any faith to his proposition, 
and vagueiy hinted that there was a 
bug under the chip, when those close 
to Stricklin, or who were in a position 
to know his plans, were approached . 
on the subject, gave it as an open 
secret, that the butcher had 
had intention of spending any mon¬ 
ey on old colored people or any other 
kind of colored people, but tnat the 
whole scheme was to frighten the 
wnite people who owned the property 
aujoining the lot on which the 
iiome was to be built, into paying him 
a fancy price for the property to pre¬ 
vent the building of the home. If the 
above is true, Mr. Stricklin has in¬ 
jured his race in several ways: First, 
by taking advantage of a friendly pa¬ 


per to promote a fraud, and second, 
to create race animosity against inno¬ 
cent members of his race in the vicin¬ 
ity of his lot, just to make a few dol¬ 
lars; and third, by using the infirmi¬ 
ties of our dear old men and women 
as a means to make money that was 
never intended to give them a night’s 
repose or a moment’s respite from 
their pains. Money is a good thing as 
a means to an end, provided the end 
is a good one. We trust that the 
charge is untrue. It is in the prov¬ 
ince of Mr. Stricklin to set himself 
right before the public in this matter. 

As we said in the outset that we 
had our doubts about the matter as 
soon as we read it, the whole appear¬ 
ing inconsistent from the fact that 
Mr. Stricklin has withdrawn his sup¬ 
port from all race enterprises since he 
commenced making money, and had 
reached tne point where he thinks he 
can get along without his race. It 
was this fact that raised the suspi¬ 
cion. His change of heart Is very 
sudden. The negro ought to buy prop¬ 
erty wherever he can get it, and if 
the prejudiced whites propose to buy 
him out just because he is a negro, he 
ought to make them pay him one hun¬ 
dred dollars for every dollar he in¬ 
vests, but no fraud should be attempt¬ 
ed to induce them to buy. 

Has Mr. Stricklin sold or tried to 
sell the property in question since the 
announcement of his old folks home 
scheme? When will he build his old 
folks home? Was the announcement 
a fake? 

As a business man and church mem¬ 
ber, Mr. Stricklin should give the anx¬ 
ious public some light on the subject. 
We await his answer.
