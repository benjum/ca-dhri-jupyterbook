e Spread of Grime Among 
the White People. 

Has National Decay Set In? 

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
□.not be unmindful of the rapid in- 
iase of crime and the tendency to- 
rds savagery manifested by mobs 
,de up of all classes of citizens. We 
i no longer shift our responsibility 
saying that mobs are made up of 
> rough element of society and take 
.ce in localities remote from rail 
Lds, churches and schools. But we 
\ face to face with the fact, whether 
are willing to acknowledge it or 
t, that mobs not only take place in 
r cities in the shadow of our 
irehes and schools, but are made up 
gely of educated so-called best cit- 
ns, white men, women and child- 
1 , business men and idlers, officers 
the law and hoodlums, Christians 
i thieves, ladies and prostitutes, all 
one indiscriminate mass vying with 
:h other in their endeavor to inflict 
5 most inhuman torture upon their 
’enseless and often innocent victim. 
Another fact that looks had for the 
ure, is that mob violence is now 
aure frequent in the centers of intelli- 
ace than in the rural districts; that 
•) more intelligent the mob, the more 
I i tendency toward savagery and the 
re excessive the torture. Public sen- 
inent now acquiesces with the mob to 
* extent that persons composing 
im no longer seek to conceal their 
ntity, knowing that the laws neither 
te or national will take cognizance 
their crime. It is simply a thirst 
human blood and not fear that the 
used will escape punishment, that 
uates the deeds of the mob. Men 
i women who commit murder and 
>e and have money enough to influ- 
:e judges and overawe or purchase 
ies are never molested by mobs 
ether they escape punishment or 

man life is today the cheapest thing 
America and Is getting cheaper each 

A price is fixed on virtue, on mar¬ 


riage ties, on land, and fixes the value 
of an oath; in fact, of too many of our 
best qualities. This accounts for the 
rapid increase of divorces, adultery* 
fornication and seduction, which is 
daily reducing thousands of young men 
and women to the ranks of the fallen, 
suicides and embezzlers. Burglary and 
many other crimes that a.re rapidly in¬ 
creasing can he traced to the same 
source. The following facts taken from 
the census reports of 1890, may fur¬ 
nish food for reflection. 

Crimes against public morals to the 
million inhabitants: 

Native Foreign Ne- 
white white groes 

Juvenile . 467 344 25 

Adults rape. 1849 1423 1036 

Fornication .32050 10676 7254 

Forgery... 2774 1423 1554 

It will be seen that the tendency to 
commit rape is greater among the 
white than the negro population, al¬ 
though it is said to be a crime pecul¬ 
iar to the negro. It is also a fact worthy 
of note that the percentage of crime is 
greater among the native white popu¬ 
lation than among the foreign white. If 
the report of crimes given us by the 
daily papers can be taken as a criter¬ 
ion, the census report of 1900 
promises to be no less discouraging. 
The days when we should send mis¬ 
sionaries abroad is past. We sadly 
need them for home consumption. ^ 

If free government i$ not »td’ perfcb, 
from the earth; if what "is J left" of’ 
American civilizatic&nia tol&gryivfc; 4? 
the people of the United t are’,to 

return to the paths of virtue that have 
invited to their shores people and cap¬ 
ital from every clime, some drastic 
measure for the suppression of crime 
will have to be adopted. If the lives 
of white men and women are to be 
safe, they will have to make the lives 
of black men and women equally safe. 


THE POSITION OF THE LIBERATOR 

As the moulder of independent 
thought and action among the colored 
voters of this state. The Liberator is 
by common consent the leader. Its 
independence, broad views and man¬ 
ner of handling public questions, its 


advocacy of self-reliance on the part 
of the colored, citizens has done much 
to inspire in them self-respect and 
self-confidence. By acting upon the 
advice of this journal the colored vot¬ 
ers have increased their prestige as 
citizens a hundred fold. It has in¬ 
stilled in them the idea that they are 
American citizens, and in order to be 
treated as such they must cease to re¬ 
gard themselves as wards of any party 
or sect, but must by the acquisition 
of intelligence rand property, the 
adoption of business principles and the 
free and independent use of the elec¬ 
tive franchise not based on their] 
color, prove themselves worthy of the 
prerogatives that American citizens- 
ship confers. They have raised them¬ 
selves in their own as well as in the es¬ 
timation of all citizens regardless of 
party in proportion as they have inde¬ 
pendently exercised these rights. The 
Liberator has advocated the suppres¬ 
sion of mob violence by the strong arm 
of the law, and has endeavored to aid 
in creating public sentiment for the 
rigid enforcement of all of our laws be¬ 
cause the stability of our institutions 
demand their enforcement. We have 
also endeavored to increase the good 
feelings now existing between the 

races in this state. While strictly 
speaking we are independent in poli¬ 
tics, we have supported the Democratic 
* ticket in the* pa$t’*few years because 
ATd *slill believe that the 
^ best interest of the ne^ro demanded it. 
*Wa beflievr ppUtfoft the negro will 
‘hhVfe’tb throw away his political iden¬ 
tity by a division of his vote, and fight 
his way to the front in the ranks of the 
various parties. In short, they will 
have to think individually for them¬ 
selves. This will preclude the possi¬ 
bility of political solidity on 
economical lines. In laboring for 
the elevation of the negro, we labor 
also for the elevation of the white 
man, because the destiny of the two 
races are so interwoven in this coun¬ 
try that they must rise or fall to¬ 
gether. Either the negro must be 
lifted up and absorbed by the white 
man's civilization or both must sink 
to a lower. We can sink a man no 
lower than we are. To pull a man down 
we must he down.

THE I. 


MY HOME IN MICHIGAN. 

(Written by Request.) 
Michigan, my Michigan, 

Home ever dear to me, 

I shall not tread thy fields again. 
Only in memory. 

It’s many a year since we did part, 
I say it with a sigh, 

For it was with a heavy heart, 

I said my last good-bye. 

I’ve wandered far by devious ways, 
From the home I love so well, 

I bade my friends of other days, 

A long and last farewell. 

I dwell upon a mountain shore, 
Near-by the sun-set sea. 

But I shall yearn forevermore, 

My Michigan, for thee. 


The meadow-lark wing. 

Is warbling full and free, 

I hear the robin-red-breast sing, 

His sweetest notes to me. 

My heart, e’en now with rapture swells 
As sun-set hours come, 

I hear the tinkling of the bells. 

The cows are coming home. 

One of the joys my youth did know, 
That did my bosom thrill, 

Was gliding o’er the winter’s snow, 
And sliding down the hill. 

Where father wielded hoe and spade, 
And planted vines and flowers, 

I lingered in the lilac’s shade. 

Many happy hours. 

Dear father’s gait is faltering now, 

His hair has grown gray, 

Deep lines are stamped upon his brow. 
His garden’s in decay. 


Beyond mountains, plains and streams 
I see my home of yore. 

I visit thee in nightly jjreams, 

And view thy landscapes o’er. 

I hear the same old melody, 

That did my childhood charm, 

? is no place so sweet to me, 
the dear old farm. 

neadows waving in the breeze, 

3 corn in streamers gay, 
ruit is swelling on the trees, 
dst scent of new-mown hay.

Beneath the daisy’s bloom, 

The summer-grasses o’er her wave. 
Above her lowly tomb. 

Oh, where are all my loved of yore? 

They’re scattered one by one. 

Some are on the Farther Shore, 
Whilst others weep alone. 

We’ll meet again, ah, yes, I know, 
From pain and sorrow free. 

With ruddy cheek and sunny brow, 
Beyond life’s storm-swept sea.

I often did play hide-and-seek. 

Beneath the orchard’s bloom. 

The summer-breeze caressed my cheek 
And kissed away all gloom. 

I wandered in the wild-woods green, 
Where beech and maple grew, 

I envied not the jeweled queen. 

But gathered violets blue. 


QUEEN VICTORIA DEAD. 

The death of Queen Victoria re¬ 
moves from the stage of human activ¬ 
ity one whose life has played an im¬ 
portant part in shaping the destiny of 
nations. The English and the world 
is perhaps better for her having lived. 
She was great, and was universally 
loved because she was good. 


RAMBLER’S NOTES 

Mr. editor, will you please allow me 
space in the columns of your valuable 
paper for a few notes? I am an old 
man and have some time on my hands 
and am therefore just idle enough to 
find fault. It is unfortunate indeed 
that we have faults, but there are so 
many, it is no trouble to find them. 
"Them” suckers Wells caught. 

Mr. Wm. Wells, who knows a sucker 
when he sees him, joined all of the 
colored secret societies and noticing 
the crude system of bookkeeping in 
vogue among them, captured the treas¬ 
ury department of each. And, although 
he found them groaning beneath the 
weight of nine hundred dollars, they 
were soon as empty as a bucket with 
Its bottom out. Well, to make a long 
story short. Wells spent three nights 
in jail, charged with embezzlement. 
When the case came to a preliminary 
hearing, it was found that a Philadel¬ 
phia lawyer could not find head or 
tail to the books. It was shown that 
the bookkeeper knew no more about 
single and double entry than a hog 
knows about sanctification. Of course 
the case against Wells was dismissed 
and laughing like a horse as he left 
the court seemed to say “that is the 
largest lot of suckers I ever caught on 
one string” 

In some of his items, the bookkeeper 
was as badly puzzled as the Missouri 
storekeeper who drew pictures of all 
articles sold on credit. A customer one 
day called to settle up and foud him¬ 
self charged with a cake of cheese 
which he denied buying. After a con¬ 
siderable dispute, the customer admit¬ 
ted that he had bought a grind-stone, 
"That’s it,” said the storekeeper, "I 
forgot to punch a hole in the center.” 

HINT: It would pay our secret so¬ 
cieties to put their bookkeeping in 
charge of competent bookkeepers here¬ 
after for their own protection. 

It pains my very heart to see so 
many well-dressed young colored men 
hanging around town with no visible 
means cf support. Now I lov thest

hate to see them waste the 
leir robust manhood in such a 
way. Everyone of them can find work 
at $1.50 per day and by saving it, make 
men of themselves. Dear boys, if you 
have not the will power to face an hon¬ 
est day's labor, give yourselves to 
some body with the request that they 
make men of you: 

"Whatsoever a man soweth, that 
shall he also reap." 

Say, young fellow do you intend to 
marry that girl that you promenade 
about the streets with so late at night? 
If you do, you had better teach her to 
stay at home with her mother during 
the evenings taking lessons in sewing 
and general housework. Then, too, it 
is a good time for her to read and 
study and stock her young mind with 
useful knowledge. It is now or never. 
Of course you want a pure intelligent, 
well trained industrious woman for 
your wife, well, if you don’t teach her 
to .stay at home more, you will be 
disappointed. Of course her mother 
ought to <each her this, but I see she 
doesn’t. 


MEN OF WHOM WE SHOULD BE 
PROUD. 

When one goes around looking for 
men and things of whom to find fault 
if he is honest, he will find many 
things that ought to he commended. 
'Now that is the condition in which 
your uncle very often finds himself. 

After hearing the farce known as 
the Wells embezzlement trial I called 
at the elegant shoe shining parlor, 146 
South Spring street and found four 
polite young men as busy as bees while 
Mr. W. H. Washington, the enterpris¬ 
ing proprietor, was calling out to the 
passers-by "you are next for a shine.” 
As I looked at the well ordered estab¬ 
lishment, its handsome proprietor and 
busy young men, I said here are a few 
colored men too busy making money to 
waste their time In useless law suits. 


ATTORNEY G. WOODSON WICK- 
LIFFE. 

A business call carried me to the 
office of our able attorney G. Woodson. 
Wickliffe, where I found a number of 
clients in waiting while he was en¬ 
gaged in acknowledging deeds, mining 
and oil claims, he being a notary pub¬ 


lic. When I saw that the bulk of the 
clients were white, I accepted it as 
proof of his ability. While seated in 
his office, I felt like one who had 
crawled out of the shade of a winter 
day into the sunlight of spring. Whlie 
some colored men were wasting money 
by "gwine” to law here was one mak¬ 
ing money by practicing law. 


Now, as is usually the case with peo¬ 
ple who have no business of their own 
I kept busy looking after that of 
others. As I passed I saw Gus Hall¬ 
iburton and his partner with no idle 
time on their hands. If these young 
men will save the money they are 
making they will be the owners of a 
snug little sum in ten years. I found 
R. A. Washington and E. Henry Smith 
as polite and busy as usual. Their 
place is neat and well patronized and 
to their credit, they don’t "blow in” 
their earnings at the gambling hells 
that infest the city, to the destruction 
of its youths, both male and female, 
white and black alike. Go ahead, gen¬ 
tlemen, your children will be proud to 
wear your names. 

Among our professional men the 
names of Drs. Sykes, Taylor and Barr 
are household words and the success 
these gentlemen are meeting with is 
indeed encouraging. Their practice Is 
by no means confined to the race, but 
to those in need of skillful physicians. 
Dr. Barr is married and is raising a 
lot of bright little Barrs. It is an 
open secret that Drs. Sykes and Tay¬ 
lor both would like to m&rry,ancUoettle\ 
down to business, in this >th.3y’ bav^Y, 
my sympathy. That’s what I did when 
I was young. I would’ Jlh \l attain if U 
had my life to live dyer;,.,* . • 

That handsome looking colored boy 
dressed in a neat-fitting uniformed 
tailor-made suit and cap who moves 
around with such a soldier-like bear¬ 
ing, is Mr. Eugene Walker’s errand 
boy. Mr. Walker and his partner, Mr. 

J. L. Holt, have built a tailoring busi¬ 
ness of which they are justly 
proud. They have an extensive busi¬ 
ness among people who are able to 
wear up-to-date clothing. 

Well, there is Mr. William McClain, 
one of the proprietors of Los Angeles 
Rubbish company. Captain G. W. Haw¬ 
kins, the wealthy furniture dealer and 


£ number of others I hope to speak of 
at some future time. They not only 
employ themselves, but give employ¬ 
ment to others of the race. 

While too many members of the 
race are spending all they make giv¬ 
ing entertainments and excursions and 
other things equally foolish, thes gen¬ 
tlemen by building up business enter¬ 
prises are making places for them¬ 
selves and their children. There is 
nobody laying awake at night watch¬ 
ing your interests , you will have to 
do this for yourself. Your success or 
failure depends upon yourself. 


JEFF DAVIS’ SLAVE A "MAYOR." 

Isaiah T. Montgomery, who was in 
his youth a slave of Jefferson Davis, 
and his eldest brother, Joseph Davis, 
founded a colony of negroes in the 
Yazoo river valley, Mississippi, after 
the war, and he is now "mayor” of 
the village of Mount Bayou, the cen¬ 
ter of the colony. The negroes own 
12,000 acres there.—Kansas City Star. 

We have the honor to know Mayor 
Montgomery personally, having visited 
his colony while we were a resident of 
the Mississippi and Yazoo Delta. Mr. 
Montgomery is a gentleman of splen¬ 
did attainments, being a graduate of 
the Oberlin, Ohio, college. Although 
the village is dominated by negroes, 
it is one of the cleanest and most or¬ 
derly in the Delta. Saloons and gamb¬ 
ling are not tolerated in the town. 
The children of the village enjoy ex¬ 
cellent educational advantages. To the 
five months’ free schools given by the 
thfe’MlIal’eVs'h.dd four, making 
£itac^oi$h§.,, ip,addition to the com¬ 
mon school they have a high school 
shppjott^d,’;tbe’phh?ny. The depot 
argent *ancf post 1 nuslress are both col¬ 
ored. There are a number of white 
families in the town, and although 
they have negro domination pure and 
simple, they seem to be in less danger 
of having their civilization subverted 
than they would were they living in 
some white ‘ communities — Leaven¬ 
worth, Kansas, for instance. 


Mr. T. B. Walker, the Pasadena 
confectioner, has opened an employ¬ 
ment office in connection with his con¬ 
fectionery. He is thoroughly reliable 
and any matters entrusted to his care 
will receive prompt attention. 53 South

JUDGE YORK. 

We have had on several occasions 
the pleasure of speaking of this gentle¬ 
man, or rather his record, in the col¬ 
umns of The LiJjepatqr. ability; 

is so well knowi]’andt appreei^tetijitj 
is needless to dwell upon it at this 
time. He is £ staunch**frjenGf # ®f* thf 
negroes, and hfis . i Ritfdl& /f£elir>£s 
often displayed towards them is high¬ 
ly appreciated and secures for him 
their united support whenever he is a 
candidate for office. 

Agpther thing that proves his genu¬ 
ine friendship is the fact that the only 
colored men that ever served on the 
juries at the court house owe their se¬ 
lection as jurors to Judge York’s jury 
box, it being his custom in putting the 
names of persons in his jury box from 
which they are drawn when their ser¬ 
vices are needed as jurors,is to put in 
the names of a few competent colored 
men. It is a characteristic of the 
negroes to never forget a friendly act. 


White Brutes Murder a Negro 
and Child 


Then Rape His Wife and 13 Year 
Old Daughter. 


NEW ORLEANS. La., Feb. 5—Two 
more murders have been added to the 
bloody record of -Tangipahoa parish. 
Arthur Nickerson, a respected negro, 
lived near Areola with his wife and 
four children. Last night a gang of 
white men went to the place and called 
the old man out. He refused to come. 
They opened fire through the windows 
with revolvers. They broke open the 
door and brained the old man with 
an ax, and a girl of 5 was then shot 
to death. Another daughter was shot 
and wounded while crossing the hall. 

The men, going to another room, 
found a daughter, 13 years old. The 
child was assaulted. One of the party 
lit a match to find his hat that he 
dropped, and saw the mother crouching 
in a corner with the youngest child in 
her arms. She, too, was assaulted. 
The whitecaps then mounted horses 
and rode away in the darkness. 


THE NEGRO’S OPPORTUNITY. 

All things considered, California of¬ 
fers the negro better opportunities to 
acquire intelligence, wealth and posi¬ 
tion than any state in the union. By 
position is meant the prominence ac- 
.oorded; Vo ‘people for their enterprise 
/nbd ^reaUla.. .IThe churches, schools, 
colleges p.nd Jectjires are all open it 
‘tisra. 'H&lclin: engage in any business 
" and if *hfe , has*the*pluck that adapts its¬ 
elf to the situation he is almost sure to 
succeed. For the people here with 
money to spend, will spend it only 
with business men who understand 
business. If colored men have gone 
into business here and failed it was for 
the same reason that white men have 
failed and not on account of their color 
—a lack of the qualities that win. 

Everybody is inclined to treat him 
fairly and if he depends upon himself 
all are willing for him to succeed. His 
civil and political rights are respected. 
The laws throw around his life and 
property, the same protection that they 
throw around those of his white fel¬ 


low citizens. If charged with any vio¬ 
lation of the law he is sure of a fair 
and impartial trial. In short he is 
looked upon as a man and if he acts 
as a man he is treated as such. If he 
fails to enjoy any of his rights it is 
because he has not had the manhood 
or fitness to make the proper demand 
for them. And it is only fair to state 
in this connection that the negro has 
not taken advantage of his opportuni¬ 
ties to better his condition. He has 
never learned how to labor in a com¬ 
mon cause for his general advance¬ 
ment. He still refuses to learn any¬ 
thing about concentrating his energies 
and hence he makes no standing for 
himself in the business world except 
here and there, although he has re¬ 
ceived in wages hundreds of thous¬ 
ands of dollars above what was nec¬ 
essary to decently feed and clothe him. 
He has thousands of dollars for enter¬ 
tainments and excursions, but not one 
penny for his business. He imitates 
the white man in everything but busi¬ 
ness and money-saving. He is too 
ready to imitate the white man’s vices 
while keeping shy of his virtues. Al¬ 
though the doors of the schools and 
colleges stand ever open to him in 
common with other citizens, he refuses 
to enter, prefering to remain ignor¬ 
ant, while earning princely wages he 
insists in being poor by spending all 
he makes. 

He will rent a house at ten dollars 
per month, when he could buy one on 
the installment plan for the same 
amount by paying a stipulated sum 
in cash,which is always small, through 
fear that the payment of $50 or $75, 
the amount of cash required would cut 
down his entertainment funds he never 
purchases a home. Of course there are 
exceptions, but not enough of them. 

When he can buy land at from $300 
to $500 per acre, he will wait till some 
white man buys it, then pay him from 
$300 to $500 for a strip 50x150 feet. 

In polities he has pursued a similar 
course, too often he has refused to 
regard any man or set of men among 
his race as leader or leaders whom he 
believed to be capable and worthy, 
preferring in their stead men who had 
nothing to recommend them to honest 
people. The politicians have not been 
slow to take advantage of this phase 
of the negro’s political weakness and 
assisted him in setting up for leaders, 
men who were distinguished mainly

for their ignorance and venality. In 
this way they managed to cheat the 
negro out of the political recognition 
to which his votes entitled him. In 
politics he has not yet learned to con¬ 
centrate his forces, except for the pro¬ 
motion of some white man. He seems 

to still believe that some party of 
white men are laying awake at nights 
watching his interest, political and 
otherwise, just because he is black. 

We are however pleased to note that 
the negro is now making rapid prog¬ 
ress in the right direction all along the 
line, but it is not near as rapid as it 
should be, under the surrounding cir¬ 
cumstances. If the negro' wants to ac¬ 
quire intelligence, wealth and the po¬ 
sition and influence they carry with 
them, he has no time to waste in look¬ 
ing after other people’s business; but 
must concentrate his means, energy 
and numbers, must save and invest his 
earnings in such enterprises as will 
furnish employment for himself and 
children. 

A race that cannot do this, need not 
hope to succeed in this country and 
opportunities given to such a people 
are as pearls cast before swine.

(George Allen Mebane in the Arena for 
November, 1900.) 

“Without books, he has learned to 
read and to write; he has labored 
without tools, made ‘bricks without 
straw,’ and lived without food, fight¬ 
ing the great battle of life against aw¬ 
ful odds in every vocation. Without 
clothing he has endured sun and rain, 
and met without flinching the chilly 
storms of prejudice and hate. He has 
fought the enemies of his progress 
and elevation, and of his right to exist 
at every turn; and thus far he occu¬ 
pies an advanced position on the rug¬ 
ged field of life, surrounded by his 
enemies, but a total stranger to de¬ 
feat.” 

If the efforts made by the south to 
legislate the negro out of civilization, 
to prove that he is not a man, to pre¬ 
vent him from demonstrating his 
worthiness to be counted a man, to 
prove that both freedom and education 
have be^n detrimental to him, and 
that he has degenerated morally, 
physically and socially, and cannot 
exist as a race; if these and other mis¬ 
spent energies were used in the appli¬ 
cation of Christian principles to exist¬ 


ing conditions, there would be no so- 
called “negro problem” to haunt the 
south, but millions of wealth, endless 
prosperity, and countless blessings 
would make that section the paradise 
of the Western Continent.”

Cattle Herds on the Ranges Are Increas¬ 
ing by the Thousands and Fatm- 
eis Are Joyful. 

Santa Barbara county is booming as a 
result of the recent rains. For the firs 
time in nine years the mountain ranges 
are being fully stocked with beef cattle. 
The Delaquesta Brothers of Santa Ynez, 
have imported 3CG0 head of Arizona and 
Mexican long horns, which will be fai- 
tened on the Santri Ynez and Cojo 
lanches. 

The San Julian ranch is fully stocked 
and at a low estimate 12,000 head of sloe®: 
cattle have been brought into the county 
since December. The only traffic trains 
which have passed over the new road 
above Santa Barbara have been stock 
trains, which were unloaded at Rio Hon¬ 
da. The sheep men will be pushed hard 
for mountain pasture, as the manopoly 
which they have had of mountain teed 
since the drouth began, is now broken 
up by the cattle men. Beef and mut¬ 
ton prices range higher that at any time 
since 1894, and a season of profit has 
opened up for the stock men. 

Ventura county stock men are loading 
the mountain ranges with Arizona, New 
Mexico and Mexican homed stock, ana 
there is feed in abundance for all the 
the cattle the ranges can carry. 

The Hobson Brothers, Ed Canet, John 
R. Willoughby, Donlon Brothers and 
Charleboise and Donlon have imported 
in all nearly 10,COO head, since the No¬ 
vember rains. 

Charles Fuller of this city has contract¬ 
ed for 750 head of Arizona long, horns fo* 
Vencura pasture with a bid for more if 
the stock can be found. The late rains 
in Arizona has forced prices up, and ex¬ 
port beef cattle cannot be had in quan¬ 
tity to meet the demand. 


CHANGE OF FIRM. 

The grocery house of Messrs. Nash 
Bros., of Pasadena, has been dissolved. 
Mr. A. K. Nash, the senior partner re¬ 
tiring, and Mr. J. D. Nash continuing 
the business. This has been a good 
store for our people and we doubt not 
it will continue to still hold its high 
reputation. We extend greeting to the 
new proprietor, Mr. J. D. Nash,

PASADENA 

Under her new charter, will soon hold 
an election to elect mayor, council- 
men, and other city officers. There 
are already a number of candidates in 
the field for mayor. Among the more 
prominent gentlemen whose names are 
mentioned in this connection are 
Messrs. W. S. Lacy and H. M. Dobbins. 
Mr. Lacey’s friends are strongly urg¬ 
ing him to stand for the nomination. 
Should he choose to do so, his chances 
for nomination and election are good. 
He has made an excellent officer and 
is popular with all classes of citizens. 
The republican leaders are favoring 
a non-partisan campaign which is 
doubtless best for all interests in¬ 
volved. The voters of Pasadena have 
put themselves on record several times 
as being independent in politics and 
the republican leaders are learning to 
respect their wishes.

houses in Pasadena none show more 
real progress than the Pasadena De¬

additional sales ladies, but has de¬ 
cided to enlarge his space in order to 
meet the demands of his patrons. A 
business man who finds it necessary 
from time to time to increase his space

THE LIBERATOR. 


MR. CHARLES BEARD, 

Who recently added to his popularity 
by taking unto himself a better half 
in the person of Mrs. L. C. Young, a 
handsome widow, is one of the enter¬ 
prising young men of the city. Mr. 
Beard gave up a position as valet for 
a wealthy gentleman, who paid him 
$60 per month, in order to enjoy the 
independence that one derives from 
employing himself. When Mr. Beard 
decided to open business as a sweep 


he introduced himself to the public 
through the medium of judicious ad¬ 
vertising, spending $400. This brought 
him immediate returns in regular work 
at $5 to $10 per day. Dressed in his 
characteristic costume he has formed 
a unique part in every public parade, 
this of itself showing his business 
sagacity, and gave him a thorough in¬ 
troduction to those who needed his 
services. He is a man of ripe experi¬ 
ence, gathered by travel in every quar¬ 
ter of the globe, which he is now turn¬ 
ing into money. His office is at 131 
San Pedro street. Tel. Black 1939.

MRS. NATION, 

The John Brown of the temperance 
movement, is playing havoc with the 
saloons in Kansas. Hatchet in hand, 
she has the governor and other state 
officers on the run and it looks as if 
the saloon men will have to give up 
the fort. When her back yards are all 
cleaned up she threatens to march to 
the sea. In such case Los Angeles 
would offer an inviting field. “The way 
of the wicked is hard.’ 


No man is your superior on account 
of race or connections. Superiority, 
according to the religion of which we 
boast so much and have so little, is 
based upon one’s ability to practice 
the Golden Rule. If you look about 
you will find your superiors and infe¬ 
riors among every race with whom you 
come in contact. The Golden Rule is 
the standard—he that follows it closer 
than you is your superior. 


There are none so humble as to be 
exempt from temptation. 

That man is poor indeed, who has 
not learned to depend upon himself. ~ 

The boy who saves his pennies, will 
some day own a dollar. 

“Men who have nothing to give, are 
always liberal.” 

The man who does your thinking 
always advises you to engage in those 
enterprises that aro most profitable to 
him. 


THE BOSTON DRY GOODS HOUSE. 

Of Pasadena has the largest and best 
selected stocks of dry goods ever 
brought to that city. The large crowds 
that visits the house daily is proof of 
low prices and fair dealing; 43 and 45
