THE LIBERATOR. 


There in no Republican 
Party. 

IT WILL BE. 

Whatever the political status of the 
colored man in this country will be 
will largely depend upon himself. Tne 
colored voter must not wait for an 
opportunity to improve his political 
status; he must make opportunities. 
The sooner the colored voter throws 
away sentiment and is guided by that 
which he knows is just and proper, 
the sooner he will improve his condi¬ 
tion politically. The white man fol¬ 
lows his conscience. The colored man 
follows sentiment. Sentiment is a 
deceptive and very often dangerous 
thing at times. The colored man has 
an idea that his debt of gratitude to 
the Republican party will never De 
paid. There is no Republican party 
now. The party that was once called 
and known as the Republican party 
has passed out of existence. We have 
parties now that deal in practical pol¬ 
itics. Human rights, civil liberty and 
equality before the law have no stand¬ 
ing in platforms of political parties. 
The colored man clings to one God, 
the same as he clings to one party. 
Whitt, Elijah E, elk J M Hale Co, h 
He forgets he is an American citi¬ 
zen. He still believes that he is the 
slave of the Republican party. Ex¬ 
isting conditions convince The Bee 
that both the so-called Republican 
and Democratic parties are endeavor¬ 
ing to eliminate the colored man from 
politics. If that is so, will the col¬ 
ored voter continue to be the willing 
tool of the Republican party? The 
last Republican platform declared it 
would reduce Southern representa¬ 
tion. The party has won. The Pres¬ 
ident has gone South and made terms 
with those who disfranchised the ne¬ 
gro and enacted “Jim Crow” laws. 
The President may be right in mak¬ 
ing terms with those who once en¬ 
deavored to destroy the Union to the 
exclusion of the colored man. The 
colored representative doesn’t think 
so. \v ithin his breast there is a 
feeling of resentment and he knows 
it. He is too cowardly to sav so. 
Many of them are looking for official 
recognition, hence they will not ex¬ 
press their true convictions. Will the 
colored man ever assert his independ¬ 
ence? Will he throw away this sen¬ 


timentality and be a man in deed and 
in fact? They are all in doubt as to 
the probable policy of President 
Roosevelt toward the colored man. 
They are waiting with suppressed in¬ 
dignation. The President has declar¬ 
ed that he will give everybody a 
square deal. It is hoped that he will. 
The colored voter will declare his in¬ 
dependence in the near future, come 
what may. It will be—Washington 
Bee.

THE NEGROS OPPORTUNITY IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 

From time to time this journal has 
pointed out the opportunity that mar¬ 
ket gardening offers the negro in this 
section of the state. Miarket garden¬ 
ing offers our people the surest and 
quickest road to independence and 
self support of any other caning in 
this* section. While other occupa¬ 
tions giving the negro self employ¬ 
ment require a small fortune to com¬ 
mence with, the main capital requir¬ 
ed to start a market garden is a will¬ 
ingness to work. Lands suitable for 
the purpose can be rented cheap most 
anywhere, especially near the coast, 
where it is best adapted. Six or eight 
weeks after planting, the gardener 
will have vegetables of some kind 
ready for the market,w hich will find 
ready sale at paying prices. 

After this he gathers and plants 
every day in the year—cabbage, peas, 
beets, onions/ radishes and many 
other vegetables growing in the open 
fields the year round. The market 
gardener finds at his door a ready 
market for everything he produces. 
Now, and for many years, the demand 
for vegetables in this section has been 
greater than the supply, and prices 
are fixed accordingly. Owing to the 
rapid growth of Los Angeles and 
other Southern California cities, the 
present ccOdjition in the vegetable 
market will exist for years to come. 
Here is a field the negro can enter 
with very little competition; a field 
that invites him, offering inducements 
to become self supporting and inde¬ 
pendent, that he can not find else¬ 
where. No one is better fitted for 
market gardening that the colored 
farmer who comes here (from the 
South. His industrial training and 
frugal habits will make him independ¬ 
ent from the start. But if he would 


take advantage of the great oppor¬ 
tunity now offered him ,he had better 
take hold at once, for already white 
men are looking this way and the 
Chinaman who has bad things his 
own way is preparing to move. The 
colored farmer, who labored 365 days 
on 40 acres of land in the South for 
less than it took to feed and clothe 
his family, can take five acres here 
and open a bank account while liv¬ 
ing like a prince. The colored farmer 
who comes here from the South and 
stops in the city makes a serious mis¬ 
take. The opportunity to make 
money is greater in the country, for 
the poor man, with the opportunity 
to spend it less than in the city. The 
facilities for educating the farmer’s 
children in this state are as good as 
those offered the children of Southern 
cities. 

There are millions in truck garden¬ 
ing and colored farmers can control 
them if they will. 


NEED OF ORGANIZATION. 

There is urgent need among the 
colored citizens and voters of or¬ 
ganization if they hope to check the 
spread of race discrimination in this 
section. The colored citizens have 
thousands of staunch friends among 
our white fellow citizens who want 
tnem to have fair play, but unless the 
negro organizes, thus putting himself 
in a position to safeguard his own 
rights, his white friends will be 
greatly handicaped. The man who 
sits down and waits for others to fight 
his battles is beaten in the start. 
Tnere are some things that need to 
be done for the negro that he will 
have to do for himself. In spite of the 
advantages enjoyed by the Germans, 
Irish and Jews, by being members of 
the white race, they each have organ¬ 
izations to look after their civil and 
political rights and guard against any 
possible discrimination. But the ne¬ 
gro, who is the victim of all sorts 
of discrimination, have no organiza¬ 
tion to safeguard his rights. If the 
colored voters were organized, they 
could get representation, not only in 
the city council, but in the state leg¬ 
islature. If the whiskey, gas, railroads 
and other interests controlled by 
white men, need and have representa¬ 
tion in the city council and state leg¬ 
islatures, most assuredly, the negro,

whose rights are being daily infringed 
upon, need and should have represen¬ 
tation in the law making bodies nam¬ 
ed. The negro has more friends among 
the Republicans who control the city 
and county politics now than at any 
time in the history of the party, but 
he will have to be organized to make 
his wants known. 

United States Senator Flint, Post- 
Master Flint, his brother; Senator 
Pendleton, Leo Youngworth, Oscar 
Lawler and J. G. Mott are broadgaged 
and progressive young leaders whose 
words are as good as gold and whose 
friendship for the negro has been re¬ 
peatedly proven. But unless the ne¬ 
gro organizes to help himself, he will 
simply lose ground and friends and 
opportunity. The uselessness of the 
present so-called organizations for tne 
advancement of the negro are so well 
known and so thoroughly mistrusted 
that lengthy mention of them would 
be a criminal waste of space. Their 
only object for existence is for politi¬ 
cal plunder during campaigns and try 
to pull ciown worthy members 01 the 
race who secure creditable appoint¬ 
ments, as they attempted to do in tne 
case of Foster Jacobs. 

The appointment of Wickliffe in the 
harbor commission, Editor Greene and 
Captain Crumbly to clerkships in the 
Assembly, and Jacobs in the city 
assessor’s office has brought forth not 
one word of commendation from these 
so-cahed race organizations. The men 
who made the appointments certainly 
deserve the thanks of the race and no 
one is in a better position to extend 
these thanks than the organizations 
claiming to represent it. Have they 
done it? No. And yet the appoint¬ 
ments named were the best that could 
have been made, tne gentlemen ap¬ 
pointed being among our most worthy 
and capable citizens. The colored 
voters, almost to a man, are grateful 
for their appointments, and it is a re¬ 
flection upon them that they have no 
organization through which to make 
their gratitude known. We must have 
organization to guard our interests 
and stand by friends. The man who 
cares nothing for his friends has no 
future.

den of Los Angeles to Mr. D. H.

mony was performed by Rev. G. R.

WHAT JAPANESE VICTORY 
MEANS. 

Means that all dark races will re¬ 
ceive a better (treatment; .that no 
nation, Christian or pagan, can win 
that plays and uses Christianity for 
racial purposes. Japan, though a pa¬ 
gan, but a true pagan in all of her 
teachings of equality and justice, has 
crushed Russia with her hypocritical 
religion. The Japs appoint all in their 
naval and military school. You do 
not have to have the pull of some con¬ 
gressman or senator to get admitted 
to the examination. Then, color has 
no affect on a man’s qualifications. 
America ought to learn from this na¬ 
val batue that rich men’s sons or any 
particular color will not and cannot 
win against brain and brawn. The 
Japanese will control the Asias, and 
if linked with China, America may 
then realize that she, like they, must 
cultivate all of her citizens.—West¬ 
ern Enterprise, Colorado Springs, 
Colo. 

Right, brother, if this country would 
pursue the same course, how much 
better it would be for all concerned. 
We would witness national growth 
instead of the present national 
decay now apparent to all. The appal¬ 
ling increase in open contempt for 
law, mob violence, the rapid growth 
of race prejudice and color discrim¬ 
ination, the practice of the officers 
of the federal government of winking 
at violations of the law respecting 
the rights of citizens of color, will 
have but one effect—the stifling of 
patriotism. No country that winks 
at crime and puts a premium on hy¬ 
pocrisy can win in the supreme test.

JUDGDE TOUURGEE PASSES TO 
HIS REWARD. 

The death of Judge Tourgee remov¬ 
ed from the stage of human activity 
a friend of manhood rights and one of 
the few men who never deserted the 
negro or his cause. One by one our 
friends are passing away. The ranks 
of those who put manhood rights 
above all else are getting mighty 
thin. In the present crises the ne¬ 
gro can ill afford to lose such a friend. 
The rebel flags have been returned, 
and the sons of the heroes who saved 
the Union are asking pardon of the 
men who tried to destroy it. The ne¬ 
gro and his rights are to be sacrificed 
upon the altar of reconcilation. It is 
only those who stoop to raise the 
lowly that live forever. 


NO COLONIZATION. 


NO SAND LOTS FOR THE JAPAN¬ 
ESE. 

The New York Times . warns all 
white men who are disposed to per¬ 
petrate upon the Japanese the sand 
lot outrages formerly perpetrated up¬ 
on the defenseless Chinaman, to 
think twice before they act. The 
Times says in substance, that the 
Japanese will not tolerate any fool¬ 
ishness; that they are in a position 
to have their treaty rights respected, 
and will not be slow about doing it. 
The outrages that have been visited 
upon the Chinaman and American cit¬ 
izens of color by mobs, and through 
the medium of class legislation can 
not he practiced upon the Japanese. 
The Chinaman and Japanese are in 
this country by treaty and because 
the white men need them and furnish 
them employment. If any wrong is 
done it wa^ done by the white men 
who made the treaties and furnish 
them employment, and the fight 
should he made upon them and not 
upon the aliens. 


The colored citizens should be cau¬ 
tious about colonizing themselves in 
this city. Instead of buying homes 
in one locality or on one street they 
should scatter out and locate in every 
section. Unless they do this they will 
come to grief. The policy of buying 
homes here and there among the cul¬ 
tured white residents heretofore pur¬ 
sued is a good one and should be 
strictly adhered to. It guarantees you 
better police and fire protection. It 
prevents the organization of Jim 
Crow schools for negroes, which 
would be followed by Jim Crow cars 
and Jim Crow courts, such as we nave 
in the South. Life and fire insurance 
companies charge a higher rate in 
negro communities than they do in 
white ones, claiming that the risks 
are greater. Buy property where you 
can get your money out of it if you 
conclude to sell.’ Go slow! Go slow!! 
Go slow!!! 


It Will Go Into Your Scrap Book. 

Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish “The Gray Road of Sorrow/' writ¬ 
ten by Mr. John S. McGroarty of The 
Times. It is undoubtedly his greatest 
production and will in coming time 
find a place with the poems, “Oh, Why 
Should the Spirits of Mortals Be 
Proud” and “Twenty Years Ago.” The 
reader in whose bosom this poem does 
not arouse some tender recollection 
_.ias not seen much of life.

The Sawtelle Sentinel’s Easter edi¬ 
tion was creditable in every particu¬ 
lar. Creditable to its publishers, cred¬ 
itable to the business men whose cuts 
and business cards appeared there¬ 
in. As an advertising medium for 
Sawtelle it distanced all competitors. 
The Sentinel is the coming journal of 
a coming town, the representative of 
the young and progressive element ot 
the community. The Sentinel has a 
good field and the ability to care for 

It. . .. 


Negroes should train their children 
to lead virtuous, temperate lives. 
Honesty apd industry should be en¬ 
couraged; hypocrisy and self conceit 
condemned. The Japanese owe their 
victory over the Russians to proper 
training, respect for law order, and 
above all respect for the rights of 
others. The boys and girls who lead 
virtuous, temperate lives will rule the 
world for God, no matter what race 
or color they represent 


Mr. Geo. Dennis, Jr., dealer m teas, 
coffee, spices, etc., whose place of 
business is 114 E. Market street, is 
doing well. Mr. Dennis came here 
recently from San Francisco, where 
he was prominent in business, polit¬ 
ical and social circles. He is a na¬ 
tive son and is one of the most gifted 
colored orators in the state.

ability and culture.

THE GRAY ROAD OF SORROW. 

The world has many a road for the feet of you and me, 

They cross the winding hills where the winds are blowing free, 

They dip down the valleys and through many a place they're cast 
And the gray road of sorrow, oh, we come to it at last. 

We come to it at last, in the mists and sighing rain. 

And though we leave it oft the whiles, we come to it again; 

We come to it again with the sighing rains that fall 
On the gray road of sorrow that loves and lures us all. 

i 

Once I thought to never walk that gray road hedged with yew. 

Nor ever did you think to come, if I can read you true— 

’Twas then that life and love were young, our blood with youth aflame, 
Yet I found you on the gray road when first to it I came.

Under the superintendency of Mr. 
A. S. Eagle, the Sunday School has 
made a wonderful growth, both nu¬

such that he has the unanimous sup¬ 
port of the whole membership. The 
various departments being in charge 
of those best fitted to conduct them. 
Prof. T. A. Greene, editor of the En¬ 
terprise, is assistant superintendent. 
* * * 


I found you in the sighing rain, beside the hedge of yew, 

With the trouble dim upon your eyes that once were dancing blue, 

With the trouble in the eyes of you, the hot tears on your cheek, 

And the lips of you a-tremble with the word you could not speak. 

And yet, oh, heart of me, as we wander down the years. 

We fear it less and love it more, that gray road of tears— 

That gray road of sorrow with its whispering yew and rain, 

Its heartaches of memory, its trouble and its pain. 

For, trod we ne’er the gray road, but always laughed along 
The paths of the primrose and the sunlit trails of song— 

Had we walked but where the happy throngs of mirth and pleasure go. 
The throb of the gray road we had not learned to know. 


The Asbury Club gave a concert

ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 


And ’tis not when the laughter and lilt of joy and song 
Rings down the way of roses where the gay and happy throng. 

That life has most to give us, but it is when falls the rain 
On the gray road of sorrow with its heart-break and pain. 

So, here’s my glass to yours, and I’ll quaff with you the wine, 

And I ll give you back another song for tha;t you gave for mine. 

But when God calls us near Him, with souls and hearts laid bare, 

The gray road of sorrow is the road that we must fare.

classic looking in the state, will he 
completed by September 1st, at the

THE RUSSIAN FLEET A TALE 
THAT WAS TOLu. 

The fleets commanded by Admiral 
Togo and Rojestvenslty have met and 
the Russian fleet is a tale that was 
told. Gallant old Togo took or sunk 
everything in sight, with losses to his 
fleet too insignificant to mention. The 
battle of tne Sea of Japan goes down 
in history as the world’s greatest na¬ 
val battle. How the awful destruc¬ 
tion of the Russian fleet was wrought, 
the world may never know. Behind 
the guns and on the decks of the Jap¬ 
anese ships none but Japanese stood, 
and they alone can tell the story if 
they so elect. The defeat of Rojest- 
vensky was expected, but the world 
was not prepared for the news of the 
utter annihilation of his fleet with¬ 
out serious loss to his adversary. The 
destruction of the Russian fleet, 
which left its home waters with the 
sound of trumpets, was the work of a 
few short hours after the battle be¬ 
gan. In a few short hours mammoth 
battle ships costing between 20 and 
50 million dollars were lying on the 
bottom of the ocean, mere heaps of 
steel ruins. Wedged in between dis¬ 
mounted cannons and broken and 
twisted steel were the dismembered 
remains of hundreds of human beings. 


SAWTELLE HAPPENINGS. 

Mr. and Mrs. Mason G. Reed have 
sold their home and purchased a lot 
on 7th street, in Santa Monica, where 
they will erect a modern cottage. Mr. 
Reed has remodeled the old Hunt’s 
barber shop which he purchased some 
time ago, and it is now one of the 
neatest in Santa Monica. The loss 
of M'r. and Mrs. Reed is seriously re¬ 
gretted. We wish them much success 
in their new home. 

* * * 

Mr. Cahal and family have removed 
to l os Angeles, where he has a job 
that pays him $40 per month. 

* * * 

Among thousands of persons who 

visited the Soldiers’ Home on Decora¬ 
tion Day were the following colored 
ladies and gentlemen who were en¬ 
tertained at luncheon at the Edmonds’ 
Villa: Miss Mary E. M. Goode and 
Messrs. R. Belsinger, Eldridge, C. H. 
Phillips, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, and 
daughter Delores of Los Angeles, Mrs. 
E. M. Detweiler of Pasadena. Mr. Bel¬ 
singer, recently of Lelande, Miss., 

who has a brother engaged in farm¬ 
ing there, was much interested in the 
growing crop on the editor’s farm, 
and was greatly surprised to learn 
that immense crops of potatoes, corn, 
pumpkins and melons were produced 
here without irrigation. The visitors 
seemed to enjoy their visit to Saw- 
telle and vicinity greatly and their 
coming was a treat to us.
