Booker T. Washington 
Speaks. 

The Need of Negro Ministers who 
set Examples of Industry. 


One of the most powerful and most 
useful nogro ministers that I know is 
one who owns the best farm in his 
neighborhood, and works at cultivating 
it in a large measure during the week 
with his own hands, preaching the 
gospel on the Sabbath. This man Is 
helping to lay the foundation for the 
race in a way that will enable his chil¬ 
dren to enjoy the best things. The 
highest moral and religious practice 
does not and cannot go hand in hand 
with idleness, -shiftlessness and pov¬ 
erty. 

I want to see an Influence go out 
from this great meeting that shall, if 
possible, take every young negro from 
oft* the street corners and from out the 
bar rooms, north and south. 

Further, I want to see an influence 
go out from here that shall result in 
lifting up and purifying the character 
of our ministers in every part of the 
country. In the negro ministry there 
are as many, as pure and useful char¬ 
acters as any race can boast of, but I 
would not be performing p\y duty to 
you and to my race did I not say frank¬ 
ly that one of the most serious and 
embarrassing duties that is yet to be 
performed is to sift the ministry with 
the finest sieve, so that the good may 
be honored and recognized, and the 
worthless taken out of the pulpit. 

As a race we are somewhat inclined 
to be emotional, to be guided by our 
feelings, to live and soar in the clouds, 


without at all times having a material 
and industrial basis on which to rest. 
The true test of the ability of a race, 
whether in the business or religious 
world, is its ability to decide upon a 
plan of action and then pursue it con¬ 
stantly, through winter and summer, 
through discouragement and encour¬ 
agement. It is the continuous, progres¬ 
sive effort, guided by intellect rather 
than feeling, that we want to cultivate. 

I have emphasized the money side of 
life, not for the sake of the value 
money has within itself, but because 
the possession of money, in most cases, 
represents thrift, economy, foresight, 
self-sacrifice and morality. 

One other question that relates to our 
environment as a race and vitally con¬ 
cerns our moral and religious growth. 
One thing to be feared where two dis¬ 
tinct races inhabit the same territory 
is that these may yield to^the tempta¬ 
tion to doubt and mistrust each other, 
and thus unconsciously bring about a 
blunting and hardening of the sensi¬ 
bilities. No race can hate another with¬ 
out that race* itself being weakened, 
narrowed and degraded, without—in a 
word—having shut out from it all those 
things that are tenderest, highest and 
sweetest in life. Let us cultivate 
friendship and love for all races and all 
individuals, and harbor hatred for 
none. In the long run it is the race 
that helps to push up that succeeds. 

I am glad that this great convention 
is held right here in the heart of our 
beloved southland, in the midst of the 
people among whom the greater pro¬ 
portion of us plan to live for all time. 
If we are to continue to make progress 
as a race, at the south, the time has 
come when in a larger degree we must 
seek out those of our white neighbors 
who are our friends and take counsel 
with them. In nearly every southern 
community there are white men who 
are just as much interested in our pro¬ 
gress as any people in any part of the 
country, and we should let these peo¬ 
ple know that we trust them and that 
we desire their friendship and their 
co-operation. 


Finally, let us never grow discour¬ 
aged. We have made immense progress 
as a race. All races, of whatever 
color, have their difficulties and dis¬ 
couragements, and we can be no ex¬ 
ception. Let us keep our faith and pa¬ 
tience, and continue to go forward. 
Let us remember that our surest pro¬ 
tection will be in our usefulness to the 
community in which we live. The 
great human law which always rewards 
and encourages merit and virtue is 
everlasting, is eternal. 


LOSE NO SLEEP 


Now that the campaign is on in this 
state, the negro should bear in mind 
that he is not running for office, the 
contest being between white men. He 
should therefore lose neither sleep nor 
time nor friends or money, but in the 
meantime think and stick close to his 
business, make and save money. Re¬ 
member that one who owns and con¬ 
ducts a farm or store is worth fifty pol¬ 
iticians. Voters who make it a business 
to own nothing but their ballots gen¬ 
erally have to vote as told. In view 
of this fact we should spend most of 
our time doing business instead of pol¬ 
itics. To let the fellows who are to 
have the jobs do the fighting is com¬ 
mon sense. This does not mean that 
the negro should not vote, but it does 
mean that he attend to his own busi¬ 
ness, do his own thinking till the polls 
open, vote for his friends, regardless 
of party, and then return to his busi¬ 
ness. This course will win the respect 
of all parties and will secure for him the 
recognition he deserves. What we need 
now is self-supporting enterprises 
owned and controlled by us.

THE LIBERATOR. 


DISTINGUISHED VISITOR S.— 
Among the many distinguished visitors 
who enjoyed the hospitality of the city 
during the A. M. E. annual conference, 
we had the pleasure of meeting Bishop 
and Mrs. Arnette. In spite of the fact 
that Bishop and wife have been mar¬ 
ried forty years, Mrs. Arnette still 
looks young and handsome. She is a 
cultured lady whose many graces aid 
the Bishop in his grand work. Elder 
and Mrs. E. T. Cottman were every¬ 
where ;made welcome. Doctor and Mrs. 
Floyd Grant Snelson of San Francisco 
were honored guests. The doctor, who 
is pastor of the Bethel A. M. E. church 
of San Francisco, is one of the best 
known ministers in the A. M. E. con¬ 
nection. His intellectual attainments 
and distinguished services as mission¬ 
ary in West Africa has made his name 
a household word wherever this church 
has unfurled its banner. Mrs. Snelson 
is a native of Georgia. She is also a 
cultured, attractive lady. Rev. and 
Mrs. Herring of Stockton, well known 
and loved for their church work in 
Pasadena; O. E. Jones of Oakland, and 
Rev. A. Simpson of Riverside. By the 
way. Rev. Simpson is a minister after 
the idea of Booker T. Washington. He 
preaches the gospel for the honor and 
glory of God, and for the elevation of 
the race, but runs a farm for a living. 
He owns and cultivates a valuable farm 
and has accumulated $10,000 worth ol 
property. It is needless to say that he 
stands well with the business men of 
Riverside. 

Among the young people we met 
were Miss Gussie Simpson, the accom¬ 
plished daughter of Rev. A. Simpson. 
She is one of the few young colored 
girls in this section who are educating 
their heads, hearts and hands. You 
are right, Miss Simpson; it is now or 
never. The most interesting little 
stranger we met was little Miss Aline 
Jones of Centerville. She graduated 
from the grammar grade several years 
ago at the head of her class, but had 
to give up her studies in the high 
school on account of poor health. She 
is a talented musician and boasts of 
the fact that she makes her own 
dresses and can cook, and wash and 
iron. She has an interesting face and 
looks upon work as a virtue. If she 
regains her health she is destined to be 
one of the model women of the future. 
—- -o----— 

A BRILLIANT RECEPTION.—Fri¬ 
day, September 5th, the elegant home 
of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Washington at 
1G07 Toberman st. was the scene of one 
of the most brilliant social gatherings 
of the season. The occasion was the 
reception tendered Mrs. Bishop Arnette 
and other distinguished lady visitors 
by the Woman’s club, of which Mrs. 
Baker is president. The spacious par¬ 
lors were beautifully decorated and 
the pink incandescent light as it fell 
in the darkened rooms upon the rich 
costumes of the ladies produced a beau¬ 
tiful effect. The doors were thrown 
open at 2 o’clock. 


Mrs. J. B. Roan and Mrs. W. E. Ford 
of Pasadena received the ladies and 
introduced them to Mrs. Baker, who in 
turn presented them to the ladies as¬ 
sembled. Two sweet little girls re¬ 
ceived the cards. The popular McVey 
orchestra furnished music. Mrs. J. B. 
Roan and Miss Gussie Simpson each 
sang solos, which were reproduced by 
the megaphone. This wonderful talk¬ 
ing machine sang several plantation 
melodies, which called to our minds 
many of the animated dances we had 
witnessed in the slavery days. “S’wanee 
River” was the favorite on account of 
the appeal to the pathetic side of slave 
life. After an hour or more pleasantly 
spent orange punch, ice cream and cake 
were served. Those present were: Mrs. 
Bishop Arnette of Wilherforce, O., Mrs. 
Floyd G. Snelson of San Francisco, 
Mrs. R. H. Herring of Stockton. Fifty 
or sixty names are omitted because 
they could not be obtained.

BISHOP ARNETTE ENTERTAINED. 


On Saturday, September G, Mr. and 
Mrs. Washington entertained at lunch¬ 
eon Bishop and Mrs. Arnette, Elder 
and Mrs. E. T. Cottman, Mrs. Holland 
and Miss Gussie Simpson; Revs. P. R. 
Green, John Pointer, A. Simpson, D. R. 
Jones and the editor of this journal. It 
was an old-fashioned Mississippi tur¬ 
key dinner, and the table was laden 
with the whole family of good things. 
Mrs. Washington, hostess, is a Missis- 
sippian and entertained her guests in 
that royal southern style. The home of 
Mr. and Mrs. Washington is one of the 
beautiful modern cottages on Tober¬ 
man street, and Toberman is one of 
the cleanest, most beautiful thorough¬ 
fares in the cultured university neigh¬ 
borhood. This street is 100 feet wide, 
lined on both sides by a wilderness of 
elegant modern homes, each with a 
green, velvety lawn as a foreground, 
with rare potted plants sitting like 
jewels on their bosoms, bounded by 
clean white cement walks, bordered by 
narrow strips of green running between 
the,m and the cobblestones, present to 
the eye a picture of contentment, com¬ 
fort, ease and happiness that one is 
not willing to forget. As we looked 
southward on this street from 16th, we 
found but one thing that tended to mar 
its beauty, and that was the absence 
of children, those gifts from our father 
above, whose presence gives to life a 
charm that nothing can, banishes care 
from the heart and weariness from the 
tired limbs. Mr. and Mrs. Washing¬ 
ton are the only colored people in that 
refined locality, and the quickest way 
to find their home is to know the num¬ 
ber, for their place looks just like the 
others. How the touch of freedom and 
opportunity is transforming the one- 
room cabins into mansions. In spite 
of slavery and its hideous offsprings, 
race prejudice and the mob, the negro 
and the whole country like a mighty 
avalanche are moving forward, carry¬ 
ing before them all opposing forces. 


KELLEY DIDN’T ESCAPE.—The at¬ 
tempt of ex-Rev. Kelley, through his 
attorneys, to escape trial in his seduc¬ 
tion case by a technicality places him 
in a worse plight in the eyes of the 
people. An innocent, intelligent min¬ 
ister charged with so grave an offence 
against religion, morality and decency 
would court the fullest investigation. 
To escape by technicality is to plead 
guilty. The moral atmosphere of a com¬ 
munity cannot be kept pure unless the 
pulpit is pure. The stream cannot rise 
higher than the fountain. 

Many of the colored pulpits are sore¬ 
ly afflicted with so-called ministers, 
who took up preaching because they 
could live in idleness and have a good 
time. The injury done to the well¬ 
being of a community by this class of 
preachers is hard to estimate. They 
take interest in no kind of work, cannot 
be depended upon to aid any caiise un¬ 
less personally interested. Although 
morality, intelligence, industry and 
frugality are the mainstays of the com¬ 
munity as well as the church, these 
things are rarely ever mentioned from 
the pulpit. The people are never taught 
to save their money, buy homes and 
land and go into business. Although 
self-reliance is the fertilizer upon 
which self-respect feeds, it is never 
taught, never encouraged. “Bring me 
your money and ‘truss God’ ” is then- 
watchword. Although continually 
preaching to you about the godliness of 
giving, they never give a penny toward 
the support of the church or of the 
church’s poor. They are everlastingly 
trying to persuade you to swap them 
your hard-earned money for treasures 
in heaven. When this class is not 
breaking up families their principal oc¬ 
cupation is idleness and begging. They 
maintain their popularty by appealing 
to the ignorance and superstition of 
their hearers. They live high,dress well 
and play havoc with the innocenee of 
the thoughtless, confiding church-going 
young women. It is needless to say 
that we have many, very many, able, 
conscientious, race-loving Christian 
gentlemen in our pulpits—gentlemen 
that would be a credit to any congre¬ 
gation. This is too well known to be 
gainsaid. When this class ceases to fel¬ 
lowship with these low, mercenary, 
cold, selfish pulpit merchants, the 
cause of the race will be greatly ad¬ 
vanced.

REV. D. R. JONES. 

Rev. Mr. Jones, secretary of 
the conference, is not only cleri¬ 
cally one of the best equipped men 
in the conference, but is an able, elo¬ 
quent speaker, and one that has done 
much for the upbuilding of the church. 










THE LIBERATOR. 


S 


UNLOADING THE NEGROES. 

The actions of the Alabama and 
North Carolina Republicans in indors¬ 
ing the disfranchisement of the ne¬ 
groes by the Democratic - parties of 
those states shows unmistakably the 
attitude of the administration at Wash¬ 
ington touching the negro’s right to 
vote. It shows further that the Repub¬ 
lican party of the country is beginning 
to regard the negro as “a body of 
death” to be gotten rid of at the first 
favorable opportunity. The recent Re¬ 
publican state and county conventions 
have carefully avoided any mention of 
the unlawful methods by which the 
colored citizens are deprived of their 
God-given rights. 

Although the crime of lynching is on 
the increase in numbers and barbarity, 
and is practiced almost exclusively 
upon the defenseless members of our 
race, the Republican party has become 
as silent as reath touching it. The at¬ 
titude of the party in this lynching evil 
is not only wrong with respect to the 
negroes who now are the victims, but 
to the white people and country as well. 
Disfranchisement and mob violence go 
hand in hand. The Republican party 
is in power, it is responsible for the 
policy of this country. The constitu¬ 
tional rights of the citizens of the 
country are in its hands. The future 
well-being of a great nation has been 
committed to its care, but if the phan¬ 
tom of wealth and power lures the 
party from the path of right and duty, 
the God Who raised up Abraham Lin¬ 
coln and the Republican party of his 
day out of the smoke of revolution to 
rescue the country from war’s bloody 
storm and devastation into which the 
wrongs of slavery had plunged it, will 
raise up another party; it may be from 
the burning bush of revolution, to lead 
this nation to the promised land of 
equality of rights and opportunity. 

The present attitude of the party on 
the race question is no surprise to us. 
It has been drifting rapidly towards a 
total abandonment of the negro and 
his rights for the past five years. An¬ 
other thing, the negro has been free 
nearly forty years, and it is certainly 
time that he should think for himself. 
If the negro hopes to enjoy his rights 
as an American citizen, he will have 
to think and act as other American 
citizens. The negro need not give 
himself any uneasiness about the 
party's disposition to throw him over¬ 
board; if it does not need his vote 
some other party will. 


CONVENTION BARS NEGROES. 
(By the New Associated Press—P. M.) 

CHARLOTTE, N. C., Aug. 28.—The 
Republican State Convention met at 
Greenbora today and indorsed the can¬ 
didacy of Thomas H. Hill of Halifax, 
Independent, for Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court. 

The convention adopted a resolution, 
accepting the Constitutional amend¬ 


ment of disfranchisement, and binding 
the party not to contest the amend¬ 
ment’s constitutionality. The conven¬ 
tion was composed entirely of white 
men. Contesting delegations of negroes 
headed by ex-Congressmen Cheatham 
and O’Hara, prominent Eastern North 
Carolina colored Republicans and oth¬ 
ers, were in every instance defeated. 
All the business of the convention was 
settled In caucus. 

Capt. Charles Price of Salisbury, di¬ 
vision counsel of the Southern Rail¬ 
way, was chairman of the convention. 
He made a speech congratulating the 
Republican party on the elimination of 
the negroes from politics in North Car¬ 
olina, saying that they were now re¬ 
leased from “the body of death.”

(By Direct Wire to the Times.) 
KNOXVILLE. Tenn.. Aug. 30— (Ex¬ 
clusive Disnatch). Animated with the 
strength of a maniac and armed with 
a silver table fork, the wife of one of 
the most prominent men in Sevier 
county rushed upon her pretty negress 
servant yesterday afternoon and liter¬ 
ally picked her eyes out of her head, 
afterward grasping her around the 
body and carrying her to a red-hot 
cooking stove, where for five piinutes 
she tortured her in satisfaction for her 
own insane jealousy. 

The woma nis Mrs. Earl Sharp of 
Sevier county, daughter of Col. Mc- 
Mahone, one of the most prominent 
men of that section, and wife of Earl 
Sharp, equally as prominent. Authen¬ 
tic details of the story have just 
reached this 'City. She was arrested 
and temporarily confined in jail, but 
afterward was released on $10,000 bond 
as soon as she quieted. 

Mrs. Sharp was married at 16 years 
of age, and is in delicate health. Her 
murderous fit was clearly oneof In¬ 
sanity.

May Run Independent Candidates. 

The colored voters are organizing for 
the purpose of securing a nominee on 
the Republican municipal ticket in city 
election. Should the Republican city 
convention see fit to ignore their re¬ 
quest independent candidates will be 
put in the field. They claim that their 
loyalty to the party entitles them to 
consideration, and if they are ever to 
be considered and treated as members 
of the party there is no better time 
than now. It is argued further that 
while the negro has teen loyal the party 
locally has not been loyal to him. For 
instance, there are sixty to seventy-five 
clerks and copyists in the court house 
and city hall, and not a single colored 
copyist is employed. This, too, in the 
face of the fact that the heads of these 
departments had the support of 75 per 
cent of the colored vote. There are 
other circumstances underlying this 
movement, one of the.m and the main 
one being the disposition of the party 


to get rid of the negro whenever it can 
get along without him. It’s silence re¬ 
garding his disfranchisement in the 
south, its say-nothing policy about mob 
murders and the recent actions of the 
Republicans in Alabama and North 
Carolina have given new impetus to 
this movement. 

Then, too, every Republican office¬ 
holder who has recognized the negroes 
has been turned down. When all of 
these little circumstances are put to¬ 
gether they furnish abundant food for 
reflection. The colored voters are be¬ 
ginning to think and this movement 
which is the result meets their approval 
generally. This movement shows po¬ 
litical progress, it shows a growing self 
reliance among the colored voters that 
should be commended rather than con¬ 
demned. Their ardor for carrying elec¬ 
tions just to see the other fellow hold 
down a fat job is cooling off. While 
this new departure can do the negro no 
harm, it will do him much good. He 
has nothing to lose, but everything to 
gain by independent actions. 

After all the treatment the negro is 
receiving at the hands of the Repub¬ 
lican party, will prove a great benefit 
to him by forcing them to think and 
act for himself.

[By Direct Wire to the Times.] 

AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 29.—(Exclusive 
Dispatch). The committee of State 
Senators and Representatives created 
by the last legislature to investigate 
different state institutions and depart¬ 
ments today made public their official 
report. The report contains a startling 
statement regarding the treatment of 
state convicts who are employed on 
lease and contract forces. The report 
says: 

“it is our conviction that the lease 
systepa is a disgrace to the state and 
ought to be abolished. As a rule, the 
life of a convict is not as valuable in 
the eyes of sergeants and guards and 
contractors as that of a dog, and in 
evidence thereof, we find that the av¬ 
erage life of a convict is seven years. 
Convicts are shot down upon the least 
provocation, and when there is abso¬ 
lutely no excuse for it. Convicts are 
working when they are sick and dis¬ 
abled, and some have been compelled 
to work until they dropped dead in 
their tracks, yet nothing so far as we 
know, has ever been done to remedy 
this evil. 

“When men are shot down like dogs 
and worked until they drop dead under 
this system, the people of Texas can¬ 
not hope to escape responsibility for 
these wrongs, and we believe that if 
the present condition of things were 
known to them and they could be 
made to realize it, they would bring 
such pressure to bear upon the next 
Texas legislature that these evils 
would be stopped. The existing meth¬ 
ods are harsh, cruel, inhuman and un¬ 
worthy of an enlightened people.”

MR. LE COMTE DAVIS FOR THE 
SENATE. 


Mr. Davis, nominee for senator from 
the 38th senatorial district, is too well 
known to the voters to need extended 
introduction. All that is necessary is 
to let his neighbors know that he is 
willing to represent them in the sen¬ 
ate. The Liberator takes pleasure in 
making this announcement. He is a 
member of the well known and popu¬ 
lar law firm of Davis & Rush, and no 
class of voters will give him a more 
loyal support than the colored voters. 
Mr. Davis is a broad, capable gentle¬ 
man that will fittingly represent all of 
the people if elected. The highest am¬ 
bition of this paper is the advance¬ 
ment of the negroes; no one will deny 
this, therefore the negro who votes for 
Davis will make no mistake.

CHEAP RATES TO CALIFORNIA, $30. 


Elsewhere in these columns will be 
found the special low rates to Califor¬ 
nia offered by the Santa Fe and South¬ 
ern Pacific routes, for the months of 
September and October. It will be seen 
that from Chicago to any point in Cali¬ 
fornia the fare is $33. Atlanta, Ga, } 
$37.85; St. Louis, Mo., Memphis, Tenn., 
New Orleans and Mississippi river 
points, $30. Colored men and women 
in the South who desire to better their 
condition by migrating to a state where 
wages are good and all citizens are 
treated alike, and where all are equal 


before the law, should now take advan¬ 
tage of the low rates offered by these 
companies. Wages are good, hundreds 
of cooks, nurse girls, cnambermaids 
can find immediate employment at $20 
to $30 per month, furnished room and 
board included. Ranch or farm -hands 
receive $1.50 to $1.75 per day of ten 
hours. On public works men receive 
$2 to $3.50 per day. It is simply im¬ 
possible to supply one-half of the de¬ 
mand for colored help, such as cooks, 
nurse girls, maids, etc. Honest, indus¬ 
trious colored men and women will 
find ready employment and kind treat¬ 
ment in California. The churches, 
schools, lectures and other places for 
mental and moral improvement are 
open to all and no state offers better 
facilities for the education of its youths 
than California does. To the colored 
home seeker no state in the Union of¬ 
fers better opportunity to acquire and 
enjoy wealth than this state. The in¬ 
dustrious, self-respecting, law-abiding 
negro is simply treated as a man, the 
other fellow, be he white or black, male 
or female, is not wanted here. The 
white people here are exceptionally 
kind to their colored fellow citizens and 
render them every encouragement pos¬ 
sible to elevate themselves. It should 
be the ambition of the colored people 
never to abuse the confidence of their 
neighbors. The editor of this journal 
will gladly furnish any information 
possible to those desiring it, if the 
writer will enclose a two-cent stamp.

50.000 ACRES OF LAND FOR SALE. 

Mr. N. P. Bailey of this city is offer¬ 
ing for sale 50,000 acres of good farm¬ 
ing land in Riverside county at prices 
ranging from $25 to $50 per acre, ac¬ 
cording to distance from the railroad. 
This land is a part of the fertile valley 
near the famous Elsenore hot springs, 
30 miles south of Riverside on the 
Southern Pacific railroad. It is very 
fertile and is adapted to all kinds of 
grain and truck farming. To the farm¬ 
er with a small capital nothing offers 
quicker and better returns than truck 
farming. To colonists and homeseek- 
ers Mr. Bailey is offering easy terms. 
Artesian wells furnish abundant sup¬ 
ply of water. See Mr. Bailey’s ad else¬ 
where in these columns.

A WEAK NOMINATION. 

In the Thirty-sixth district Ben W. 
Hahn of Pasadena is the nominee for 
the senate, winning over Willis by a 
few votes. Hahn is a reputable lawyer, 
whose younger brother is the attorney 
of the Anti-Saloon League. Even this 
fact will he used against him by the 
Democrats, who will probably inject 
into the contest that unique and mar¬ 
velous statesman. “El Hutch.” Possi¬ 
bly Willis would have been the strong¬ 
er man before the people.—Times. 

If the Democrats do not capture the 
Thirty-sixth senatorial district, it will 
be a case of refusing to pick up a dollar 
after finding it. 


WILL THE NEGRO VOTE FOR MR. 

WHITE? 

There is a very strong feeling among 
th© colored voter either to vote 
against Mr. White, Republican candi¬ 
date for sheriff, or let the office of sher¬ 
iff go by default. It is claimed that 
Mr. White’s friendship for negroes is 
away below zero. There are other gen¬ 
tlemen who will be remembered and 
overlooked in the booth. We are not 
dealing in hearsays, but what we know 
from personal conversations with the 
colored voters. The growth of political 
independence among the colored voters 
in the past four years has been phenom¬ 
enal and like white men they are learn¬ 
ing to, at least, try to do at the polls 
what they failed to do in the conven¬ 
tion. There is a new generation of col¬ 
ored voters who knew not Joseph 
(slavery) and cannot be kept in line as 
easily as the old fellows whom the Re¬ 
publicans are helping to disfranchise. 

-o-- 

A DELUSION. 


The scheme to build up a white Re¬ 
publican party in the south by assist¬ 
ing the Democrats in the disfranchising 
business will prove to be a delusion. 
It will only increase Democratic con¬ 
tempt for the Republican party. The 
white men of the South are Democrats 
by birth and habit, and will vote that 
ticket as long as there is a Republican 
ticket to vote against. The white men 
of the South don’t have to join the Re¬ 
publicans to get office, neither state or 
national; they will get the offices if 
they want them, regardless of the party 
in power at Washington. The white 
Democrat who joins the Republican 
party will be ostracized and disfran¬ 
chised as were Longstreet, Chalmer 3 
and McLauren, late of South Carolina. 
Just so sure as the negro got free from 
slavery, just so sure will he be freed 
from the present unjust discrimination, 
the Republican and Democratic parties 
to the contrary, notwithstanding. 

--o-- 

IT MAY BE GOVERNOR LANE: 
The failure of the labor party to put a 
ticket in the field and the refusal of the 
labor leaders to endorse either the re¬ 
publican or democratic state tickets 
decreases Dr. Pardee’s chances of elec¬ 
tion, while correspondingly increasing 
those of Mr. Lane. The pleacing of the 
state executive committee in the hands 
of the Flint push, who were Pardee’s 
bitterest enemies in the convention, 
looks bad for party harmony. If 
Pardee is to be elected his friends cer¬ 
tainly should have charge of his cam¬ 
paign. Let the best man win; both 
candidates are gentlemen of ability, 
fully capable to fill the office. The 
state will be safe regardless of who 
wins; the governor will be a white 
pian.

Pardee by the gallant Gage forces. This 
they did without the aid and in spite 
of the combined opposition of the Flint 
push. He visited Oakland, the home of 
the nominee, and met many of the doc¬ 
tor’s colored neighbors, all of whom 
speak well of him.

Bishop Arnette, one of the most dis¬

is in the city holding the annual con¬ 
ference of the A. M. E. church. The 
reception given the Bishop and visit¬ 
ing ministers was one of the largest 
ever given in the city. Bishop Arnett 
is an able, scholarly gentleman, a man 
of commanding appearance, whose clas¬ 
sical bearing makes him a man of mark 
in any assemblage. He was a warm 
personal friend of President McKinley 
and was to that great apostle of Amer¬ 
ican progress what Booker T. Washing¬ 
ton is to President Roosevelt.

One thing the colored ministers 
should teach the people is that no idle, 
shiftless, extravagant, shouting, im¬ 
moral persons can inherit the kingdom 
of God. The kingdom of God is with 
men. “Thy kingdom come, thy will 
be done on earth, as it is in heaven.” 
Blessed are the meek, for they shall 
inherit the earth. That is holies and 
lands. The fellow who does not bother 
about inheriting some of the earth 
spoken of cannot claim an heirship to 
property anywhere else. He is best 
prepared to die who reaches the high¬ 
est ideals in this life. The fellow who 
is too shiftless to pluck for himself 
some of the sweets from life’s bountiful 
storehouse is too shiftless to walk the 
straight and narrow way that leads to 
that celestial city. Blessed are the pure 
in heart, for they shall see God.
