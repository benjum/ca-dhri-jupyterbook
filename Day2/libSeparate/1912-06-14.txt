LIVES OF NEGROES GETTING CHEAP.—Page 4. 


The refusal of the Democrats 
of the District of Columbia to 
allow the Negro Democrats to 
take part in the Democratic pri¬ 
maries is going the rounds of the 
colored press of the country. 

The Progressive Republicans of 
this city, county and state raise 
no objection whatever to the Ne¬ 
groes voting at elections, but 
simply close the door of hope to 
them in the distribution of oppor- 
opportunities. Although the Negro 
voters made possible the triumph 
of the present city and county 
office holders, they are making 
use of their power to systemati¬ 
cally close every position to the 
Negroes that carries with it manly 
recognition. 

Take the court house, for in¬ 
stance: of the hundreds of clerks 
and copyists employed there only 
one is a Negro. She is a mulato 
woman in the County Recorder’s 
office. The number of clerks 
employed in the Recorder’s office: 
deputies, 33; copyists, 92, total 
125; one Negro woman. In the 
Tax Collector’s: clerks, 40; Negroes, 
none. County Clerk’s office, clerks, 
44; Negroes, none. Tax Asses¬ 
sor’s: clerks, 34 Negroes, none. 
County Auditor’s: clerks, 14; Ne¬ 
groes, none. In the Sheriff’s office 
deputies, 19; bookeepers, 2; one 
Negro deputy. County Treasur¬ 
er’s, clerks, 6; Negroes, none. 
County Superintendent’s Educa¬ 
tion: clerks, 10; Negroes, none. 
In offices of the Dist. Atty. and 
Coroner no Negro is employed, al¬ 
though both gentlemen owe their po¬ 
litical salvation to the Negro voters^ 
the majority of the white voters 
voting against them. 


What is true at the court house 
is true at the city hall. Of course, 
the city is under civil service which 
of late in some way side-tracks 
competent Negroes. 

That these conditions exist here, 
is the fault of the Negro voters 
alone. The solid Negro vote of 
this county thrown against any 
county officer will defeat him. 
The treatment the Negro voters 
are receiving at the hands of men 
they elected to office is wrong. 
For the Negro voters to tamely 
submit to such treatment is un¬ 
manly. 

In Mississippi, for instance, 
where the Negroes are not allowed 
to vote, they do all of the street 
work, take care of the state capitol 
and capitol grounds, care for the 
court houses and p u b ] i c 
buildings throughout the state. 
Mississippi is a Democratic state. 
The Negro in that state gets the 
positions above mentioned because 
he is willing to work. 

In this Republican city and 
county, as a reward for putting 
white men in office, the Negro is 
confined to cleaning spitoons and 
cleaning after horses in the streets, 
where he is continually in danger 
of death by street cars, automobiles 
and passing vehicles. When the 
Democrats were in power in this 
city the Negroes were given re¬ 
presentation in the parks where 
the pay is better, the work lighter 
and life and limbs are safe. By cun¬ 
ning manipulations the present 
Good Government administration 
has gotten all of the Negroes out 
of the parks; and unless the Negro 
with his vote, arrests the progress 
of the color line in the public 


service, the Negroes in the police 
and fire departments will be eased 
out. This is to be the next move. 

The County Hospital. 

The Democrats of the District 
of Columbia would not allow the 
Negro Democrats to vote at the 
primaries. 

The progressive Republican 
members of the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors, refused the 
daughters of black Republicans 
admission to the nurse-training 
school at the county hospital, be¬ 
cause of their color, although the 
school is a public institution sup¬ 
ported by public taxation. These 
black Republicans are not only 
taxpayers but patriotic, law-abiding 
citizens. But they are Negroes, 
and all attempts on their part to 
better their conditions must be 
discouraged, even if every principle 
of right and justice be sacrificed. 

One of the gentlemen responsible 
for that outrage against the rights 
of the educated young Negro women 
will be a candidate for re-election 
this fall. Without the Negro vote 
he cannot win at the primaries. 
Will he get the Negro vote? The 
colored janitors are to be forced 
to keep the colored voters in line 
or lose their jobs. Can office 
holders, who treat you with such 
contempt, get your vote? 

Another scheme will be to put 
a little money in the hands of a 
few irresponsible Negroes who have 
just arrived, coming from a sec¬ 
tion where their rights were ig¬ 
nored—men unaccustomed to fail- 
treatment. Such men for a few 
dollars will sacrifice rights that

no decent citizen would think of 

It is in this way the colored 
voters are being systematically 
robbed of their rights. It is in 
this way that the robbery is to 
be kept up and the cry of “race 
prejudice” used as an excuse by 
trickey politicians, who are now 
so much in evidence. 

At the hands of Governor John¬ 
son the colored voters have fared 
no better. 

We shall have more to say on 
this subject later on.

“Consider the lilies of the field ,, 
how they grow; they toil not , neither 
do they spin; and yet I say unto 
you: That even Solomon in all 
his glory was not arrayed like one 
of these.”—Mathew 6:28:29. 

It was from the above sublime 
passages that Rev. Kenchin preach¬ 
ed an able, impressive Children’s 
Day sermon at Wesley Chapel, 
last Sunday. He showed • that as 
it is now, it was at the time when 
our Saviour spake the words 
qu oted, men and women were 
more interested about the with¬ 
out, than the within. Christ wanted 
men to know that the things that 
make life worth while and beau¬ 
tiful are from within and not de¬ 
pendent upon what they put on. 
What He wanted us to learn, 
is that we should not become so 
absorbed in what we eat and 
wear that we lose sight of things 
eternal. The God whose wisdom 
is displayed in the delicate struc¬ 
ture of the lilies; the beautiful 
tent of the rose, and prepared for 
our entertainment all nature with 
her grandeur and beauty will for¬ 
get none who trust and obey Him. 

Turning to the children the 
pastor likened them to the lilies 
emblems of purity and urged 
the importance of leading them 
in the foot-steps of the Saviour 
by exemplary lives. 

The Children’s Day exercises 
which took place in the evening 
were worthy in every way of the 
occasion, and were largely attended. 
The children made a fine appear¬ 
ance each playing his part well.

RECEPTION TO DELEGATES 


A good size audience attended 
the reception tendered Rev. Peck 
and delegates who attended the 
General Conference at Kansas City. 
Addresses were delivered by Rev. 
Kenchin and Messrs. Hale, Hall 
and a member of the trustee board. 

Mr. Hale’s address was a good 
one and was well received. The 
audience was swept by a consider¬ 
able ripple of mirth, when Mr. 
Hale said in the course of his re¬ 
marks that: “there were a good 
many job hunters in the Confer¬ 
ence, but we defeated them.” 

Rev. Peck was in excellent 
spirits and wanted it understood 
that that meeting was not one of 
condolence, that he had not been 
defeated and that he would be 
a red-hot candidate four years from 
now. He said the candidates, re¬ 
cently elected bishops, had been 
running twenty, sixteen, twelve 
and eight times respectively. “So 
you see I have just commenced 
running.” 

Of course, it is understood that 
the President of the Afro-Ameri¬ 
can Council will never again be 
entrusted with Rev. Peck’s future 
bishopric fights. The most ser¬ 
ious problem now confronting Rev. 
Peck is, how to keep Alexander’s 


“mouf shet.” He somehow kept 
Alexander away from the recep¬ 
tion which of itself was considered 
by Rev. Peck’s friends as a master 
stroke. Rev. Peck’s friends, how¬ 
ever, take a rather gloomy view of 
the situation and say: “unless he 
muzzles the President of the 
Council his case is hopeless.” 
“You see the fellow was never out 
of the state before; that’s why he 
is belching so,” said a trustee.

NOT SO FRATERNAL 


The other day, the editor of 
the Fraternal Bulletin and the 
correspondent of the Richmond 
Planet came near coming to blows. 
The trouble grew out of the Planet 
man advertising the Bulletin. 

Seeing the P. man at some 
distance, the B. editor leaped from 
his wheel and made a dash for 
him. 

Assuming a defiant attitude the 
Planet scribe said: “If you put 
your hands on me, I will bust 
your fist all to pieces with my 
head!” 


This put the Bulletin editor to 
thinking—a thing it is said he 
hasn’t done for many moons. 
After sizing up the Planet man, 
who looked like a big human bone, 
he seemed to conclude that “dis¬ 
cretion is the better part of valor,” 
backed off, remounted his wheel, 
leaving his advertiser in undisputed 
possession of the field.

LIVES OF NEGROES CHEAPER 
IN THIS CITY NOW, THAN 
EVER 


There has never been a time 
in the history of this city and 
county when the lives of Negroes 
were so cheap as now. Those who 
doubt this have only to call to 
mind the number of Negroes who 
have been murdered in cold blood 
in this city in the past, say, six 
years, and then consider the ease 
with which the persons murdering 
them escaped punishment, and our 
assertion is absolutely proven. 

It requires no expert to discover 


the cause of this cheapening of 
the lives of Negroes in this com¬ 
munity. Whenever evilly dis¬ 
posed persons discover that they 
can murder certain members of 
a community without encountering 
serious trouble, they murder such 
persons with slight or no provoca¬ 
tion, especially if they hold human 
life cheaply. These are the con¬ 
ditions that have obtained in this 
county with respect to the lives 
of Negroes, in recent years. Of 
the Negroes that have been mur¬ 
dered in this county in the past 
six years by lawless white men 
no serious attempts have been 
made to bring them bo justice. 

The white man who murdered 
Godfrey, a few years ago, was 
never tried for the crime, although 
the murderer had no provocation 
for committing the deed. 

The white man who assassinated 
Perry on Baldwin’s ranch was 
promptly discharged on his own 
testimony, but on the demand of 
the Monrovia people he was re¬ 
arrested, tried and given a long 
term in the state’s prison. 

There are other flagrant cases, 
but those are sufficient. 


Was She Murdered? 

On May 20th, the dead body 
of Mrs. Mary Rogillio, colored, 
was found in a white lodging house, 
137 South Broadway. The keeper 
of the house states that the woman 
came there on the night before, 
with a white man and registered 
as man and wife. When it was 
discovered that the woman was 
a mulato no very serious attempt 
was made to ascertain the real 
cause of her death. Although 
there was an ugly bruise on one 
side of her head, heart disease 
was given as the cause of her 
death. If the bruised skin had 
been removed from her head a 
different decision might have been 
reached. But she was a Negro 
and why the trouble? No efforts 
have been put forth to find the 
white man who took the woman 
to the place. He could certainly 
throw some light on the case. 


But he was a white man and she 
a Negro. 

Reverse the case: suppose the 
woman had been white, the man 
black and the proprietor of the 
house black. The District Attor¬ 
ney’s office would have turned the 
city upside down in search of the 
Negro. The lodging house would 
have been photographed and put 
in bad with the police department. 
A murder charge would have been 
made against the Negro who took 
the woman to the house and vio¬ 
lence suggested by the daily papers. 

But She Was a Negro. 

Mrs. Rogillio was considered, 
by those who knew her, as a woman 
of good moral character. She was 
a working woman, and married 
and seemed devoted to her husband 
who is expected to arrive here 
in a few days from Olda. How the 
white man got her to the house 
will never be known. 

Another Case. 

A few years ago, a notorious 
crib woman, white, was found 
murdered in her crib. A deso¬ 
lute young Negro man with hun¬ 
dreds of white men of the same 
kind were seen in the neighbor¬ 
hood on the night preceeding the 
murder. The Negro was arrested 
on suspicion as the murderer and 
kept in jail several months. For 
want of evidence fixing the crime 
upon him, he was finally discharged. 

Whenever a Negro has even 
been suspected of murdering a 
white person he has had to face 
a jury trial for being suspected. 
Not so with white men who mur¬ 
dered Negroes; they have in nearly 
every case, escaped the annoyance 
of jury trials. 

The Liberator believes in and 
advocates the rigid enforcement 
of the laws without regard for 
race, color or condition. It is 
the only protection that society 
has. 

The prevalence of mob law in 
this country is due to the condi¬ 
tion we are complaining of. It 
is not the crimes that Negroes 
commit that provoke [mob’violence, 


























THE LIBERATOR 


FiTrs 


for white people commit the same 
and worse crimes many times, 
each day without fear of summary 
violence, but it is the low price 
put upon the Negro’s life every¬ 
where that makes them victims 
of the mob.. 

That’s all. We have neither 
respect nor sympathy for criminals 
of any class, whether it be a red- 
handed murdered or officers of 
the law who aid mobs because their 
victims are weak. 

Colored men and citizens, this 
cheapening of life demands your 
serious consideration. There is 
danger ahead.
