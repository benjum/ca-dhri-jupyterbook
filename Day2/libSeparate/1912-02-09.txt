A NATIONAL DISCRACE. 

Innocent Negro Women Hanged and Burned. 
White Pulpits Silent. 


One day last week a deserter 
of the United States army gave 
himself up in New York city. 
Two years ago this soldier had 
assisted in lynching a Negro in 
Pensacola, Florida, and said his 
conscience forced him to place 
himself in the hands of the law. 
Now that the authorities have a 
self-confessed lyncher, what will 
they do? They will be greatly 
embarrassed of course. Convic¬ 
tions for lynching have failed, 
not for the want of evidence, 
but for the reason that the courts 
refused to see the evidence. Now, 
what will be done in this case? 
They can say he is insane. Who 
would believe that conscience has 
anything to do with lynching? 
What if the American Nation could 
have an awakened conscience on 
lynching! Remember Coates- 
ville, Pennsylvania. 

The Chicago Tribune keeps tab 
on the bloody record. According 
to the Tribune , during 1911 there 
were 71 lynchings. 

A Negro was lynched near Mer¬ 
idian, Mississippi, not long since 
because he assaulted a white man 
with a stick' 

Three Negroes including a 
woman were burned near Savan¬ 
nah, Tennessee, about the first 
of December. Late dispatch sent 
out from Memphis tell the story: 

“Memphis, Tenn., Dec. 6.— 
Two Negroes and one young Ne¬ 
gress were burned to death by a 
mob of white land tenants, who 
objected to the occupancy of land 
by colored people, near Savannah, 
Tenn., yesterday, according to 


meager reports received here to¬ 
day. 

“The three Negroes were travel¬ 
ing to a gin with a load of seed 
cotton. They were waylaid, held 
up and tied to the wagon load 
of cotton, it is said, and the mob, 
after building a fire beneath the 
wagon, stood guard until the wagon 
was consumed. The Negroes' 
team consisted of two mules." 

On January twenty-second three 
men and one woman, all Negroes, 
were lynched near Hamilton, 
Georgia. A well-to-do farmer was 
shot the day previous. These 
four tenants on the dead farmer's 
place were arrested. A mob 
gathered, hung them to trees, and 
riddled their bodies with bullets. 
Read carefully two significant para¬ 
graphs of the dispatch giving an 
account of this horrible deed: 

“The Negroes protested their 
innocence to the last, but the mob 
would have none of it. 

“No motive for the killing of 
Hadley, who was very popular, 
can be advanced by people here." 

Note the absence of the usual 
confession. Admittedly the motive 
was not found, but someone must 
die. Four Negroes would do. 

LET THE WORLD SIT UP 
AND TAKE NOTICE THAT THE 
ASSAULT ON WOMANHOOD 
IS NOT GIVEN AS THE REASON 
FOR THESE LYNCHINGS. 
And these are not picked cases. 
LYNCHING FOR ASSAULT ON 
WOMANHOOD IS THE EXCEP¬ 
TION. Lynching is a murderous 
outburst of lawless race prejudice 
against a helpless people. 

When will this great American 


Nation take notice of the peril 
that every Negro faces daily? The 
guarantee of life for the average 
Negro American citizen is a mock¬ 
ery.-—S. W. Christian Advocate. 


EX-PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT 
ENDORSES MOB LAW 


The Daily Observer of Charlotte, 
N. C. (white) in a strong editorial 
denouncing mob law strongly and 
condemns ex-president Roosevelt's 
endorsement of lynchings has the 
following to say: 

“Another great man in this coun¬ 
try, the same being Theodore 
Roosevelt, former president of the 
United States, in a recent article 
in the Outlook, of which he is con¬ 
tributing editor, made this weak 
and pitiful plea for the mob. 
'Dreadful though it is for the mob 
spirit to be aroused in the com¬ 
munity by such a crime, it would 
be even worse if the community 
did not feel the fury of indignation 
which produces the mob spirit.' 
This is encouraging the mob spirit 
and this is the sort of namby- 
pamby talk that has encouraged 
the 'fury of indignation' which 
has made the mob possible in this 
civilized land. With Governor 
Blease, in South Carolina in sym¬ 
pathy with the mob, and with 
Colonel Roosevelt in New York, 
excusing the mob spirit on the 
ground that it is produced by the 
'fury of indignation' we must im¬ 
press the law-abiding people of the 
United States as to one of the ele¬ 
ments from which we must free 
ourselves if the law is to be respected 
























TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


and its violation is to be punished.” 

In spite of the encouragement 
given the mob from time to time 
by ex-president Roosevelt a few 
colored men met and organized 
a Roosevelt Club in this city one 
evening this week. _ 

Will wonders never cease? What 
are these gentlemen driving at 
anyhow? While we disagree with 
president Taft's southern Negro 
policy and some of his other policies, 
there is one thing to his credit— 
he has yet to endorse lynching. 
—Editor. 


DUTY OF NEGRO MINISTERS 


If the ministers of the gospel 
would set aside a time, free from 
selfish motives ; and throw the 
church doors open to the people 
in a general meetin and preach 
a sermon on race unity, race patron¬ 
age of business enterprises, and 
show to the masses their plain 
duty, they would be carrying out 
the plan of “Earthly Salvation.” 
which would create an everlasting 
harmony with the spiritual plan. 
To do this the minister must be 
right; he must set the example; 
his sermon will have no effect if 
he tells the masses about race pat¬ 
ronage and race unity tonight and 
in the morning calls the white gro¬ 
cer, the white coal dealer and the 
white laundryman to fill his orders 
for his household. No general plan 
of acrion is effective which has a 
negative strain.—St. Louis Central 
Afro-American. 


Mr. Goodman Braye has removed 
his real estate and employment 
office to 134 North Spring Street. 
He will be pleased to meet his old 
friends. 


Mr. and Mrs. W. S. Stepp took 
their departure on Thursday for 
an extended pleasure trip north 
and will spend some time visiting 
with friends at San Francisco and 
Oakland. While at Oakland they 
will be the house guests of Mr. 
and Mrs. George Addis, 1719 East 
8th street. 


DR. HILL PREACHES A GREAT 
SERMON 


It was our good fortune to hear 
Dr. Hill’s sermon, “The person 
and Office of the Holy Ghost” 
In a spirited soul'stirring manner 
the choir and congregation sang 
“Joy to the World the Lord ha 
Come.” 

This was followed by some pop¬ 
ular selections after which Dr. 
Hill taking for his text; Acts. 
2nd Chapter 37th verse, preached 
an able sermon, harmonizing several 
portions of the Scriptures that 
seemed to conflict to the delight 
and' idiflcation of his hearers. 

“Before the coming of Christ' 
it was God the Father who watched 
over the world while the Holy 
Spirit by inspiration gave the world 
the Scriptures through the prophets 
and other inspired men. To recon¬ 
cile men with God, Christ sojourned 
thirty years on earth and left that 
the comforter —the Holy Spirit— 
might come. And now the human 
family is living under the guidance 
of the Holy Spirit,” said the doc¬ 
tor. He sustained this and every 
position taken by numerous refer¬ 
ences. In his usual way, Dr. Hill 
made what would be a dry subject 
so intensely interesting that the 
enthusiasm of his audience knew 
no bounds at times. 

Every seat in the auditorium 
was taken and it would be hard to 
find a more intesting congregation 
than that of Mount Zion. More 
young people attend that church 
in proportion to its membership 
than any church in the city. The 
same may be said in regard to 
their intelligence. In the things 
that go to make up a desirable 
church membership and all around 
citizens, few of our city pastors 
have accomplished more in a like 
period of time than has Rev. 
Hill. 

There is talk of moving Mount 
Zion to some location offering a 
wider field for its services. This 
is a splendid idea and means 
much for all who come within 
the scope of its influence.

THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


The Colored Ministers Federa¬ 
tion of Los Angeles county, one 
of the most formidable organiza¬ 
tions among the colored people 
of the Southwest, held an important 
business meeting in the auditorium 
of the Young Men's Christian 
Association. When the gavel of 
president Rev. J. D. Gordon 
sounded calling the gathering to 
order at 10 o'clock, there were 
nearly half a hundred of the most 
prominent clergymen and laymen 
of Los Angeles county present. 
Notable among the laymen present 
who are prominent in public af¬ 
fairs were Editor Jeff L. Edmonds, 
Sr., the veteran editor of the 
Liberator and G. Walter Snell. 
One of the most advanced moves 
of the seession was the merited 
election of Rev. Dr. J. Gordon 
McPherson, one of the best known 
Negro press representatives in the 
country, formerly editor of the 
“Calif rnia Forum," as secretary 
of the Religious and Publicity 
Bureau for the decemination of 
Religious nformation relative to 
the colored people of Los Angeles 
and Southern California. 

The men's forward movement 
of which Prof. T. A. Greene, 
general secretary of the Y. M. C. 
Association was given new impetus. 
This promises to be one of the 
geratest movements ever launched 
in the world's history in the in¬ 
terest of the laymen. Within a 
few days the committee selected 
from among the prominent lay¬ 
men of the several churches will 
be announced. They hope to en¬ 
roll at least 3,000 men and boys 
from among the best of the Christ¬ 
ian manhood of greater Los An¬ 
geles. Forward is the battle cry. 
Let the enthusiastic pastors arouse 
their men to action. This is the 
one Big Opportunity of life, so 
grasp it now. 

Among the several pastors that 
reported excellent services were the 
Rev. J. A Cole of St. Paul Baptist 
church; Rev. A. J. Norris of the 
East Side C. M. E. Mission; 
Rev. J. H. Redd of A. M. E. church 
at Furlong Tract; Rev. J. A. 
Trimble, Boyle Heights Baptist 
church; each of them reported 


a fine day throughout. At 11.30 
o'clock president Gordon introduced 
presiding elder Rev. Jas. A. Stout 
of the colored M. E. church as the 
speaker of the hour, who delivered 
one of the most forceful and prac¬ 
tical addresses upon that im¬ 
portant subject: “The Minister 
and Politics." The speaker held 
his hearers spell bound and many 
times was interrupted with out¬ 
bursts of applause by the enthused 
auditors. The address showed 
careful preparation and research 
into politics, both ancient and 
modern. The conclusions reached 
that as politics are the science of 
government it is the duty in¬ 
cumbent on the part of the minis¬ 
try, to enter the great po¬ 
litical arena and play their part 
in the battle for common decency 
and civic righteousness. 

The address was enthusiastically 
endorsed and the speaker highly 
complimented. 

Rev. Dr. E. Wesley Kenchin of 
Wesley Chapel M. E. church was 
given a warm reception on entering 
the meeting. Dr. Kenchin is the 
honored vice-president of the Fed¬ 
eration and is held in high esteem 
by his ministerial colleagues. Dr. 
Kenchin reached the city a few 
days ago from a tour throughout 
the state where he addressed great 
audiences in company with many 
speakers of international note at 
the religious parliments of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church. The 
topic for the next meeting Tuesday 
morning will be a question “How 
far can the church conform to the 
world in amusements." Speaker 
Father W. T. Cleghorn of St. 
Phillips Episcopal church. 


Secretary J. Gordon McPherson 
is arranging for a luncheon between 
the pulpit and the press to take 
place at the close of the session. 
Let the press and pulpit be bought 
together in this mid-day luncheon. 
All who wish to take part will 
notify the secretary by postal card 
or phone. This luncheon will be 
followed by one between the pul¬ 
pit and the bar; also the pulpit 
and the doctors. 

Let the pulpits of greater Los An¬ 


geles see to it that the Federation 
shall become a power for moral 
uplift.—Church Reporter 


Rev. McMickens of the Christ¬ 
ian Church was the speaker at the 
Y. M. C. A. last Sunday afternoon 
the greater part of his remarks 
were devoted to the efforts of 
colored people in business. 


Mr. Edward Golmon, a mission¬ 
ary from Liberia, Africa s in the 
city for a few days he wi 1 speak 
in Pasadena Sunday afternoon and 
he will fi 1 engagements at River¬ 
side, Duarte and other points in 
Southern California, before he 
leaves. 


The Masquerade Ball given by 
the So jo rner Tenth Society at 
Washington and Central Hall of 
Monday last, drew a large attend¬ 
ance of merry makers and a most 
enjoyable evening was spent. 

The Uniform Rank of K. of 
P. gave a very pleasant smoker on 
Monday evening after obligating 
three knights.

TOO MANY FRATERNAL SO¬ 
CIETIES 


In his very able address Sunday 
afternoon Attorney Ceruti said that 
the Negroes can get on handsomely 
with fewer fraternal organizations. 
He deplored the lack of commercial 
organizations and depicted the 
results of the absence of such or¬ 
ganizations. As an example he 
showed that the Negro with his 
one horse wagon formerly controlled 
the transfer business; how the 
foreigners seeing that there was 
money in it and organized companies 
and which took charge of the 
business. 

What is true in the transfer 
business is true in other lines. 
The time has come when colored 
men should engage in something 
besides caring for the sick and 
burying the dead. 


FOOL S PARADISE QUIET 


The ‘‘limber-jaws” at the Fool’s 
Paradise (Forum) learned for the 
first time, last Sunday that, if 
ten men put ten dollars each in 
a pot, they would have enough to 
open a soup joint. Immediately 
three of four of them jumped to 
their feet and thanked Heaven 
for at last sending a man to town 
with sense enough to tell them how 
to go into business. Thereupon 
four “limber-jaws” threatened to 
lay ten dollars each on the table 
and open a bank. When the 
money was called for, their enthus¬ 
iasm underwent a sudden cooling 
and not a dollar came to the sur¬ 
face. This proved a mighty set¬ 
back to the gentlemen offering the 
suggestion. As he expected to 
witness the launching of a new 
business the day following. 

The chief of the “limber-jaws” 
relieved the embarrassment of the 
speaker by declaring the jaw 
whoop ended. 


EXPANDING 

Attorney Walter R. Taylor 
wishes to announce to his many 
clients, friends and the public gen¬ 
erally, that owing to his increased 
and growing clientele, he has been 


forced to seek larger quarters; 
he has therefore moved into suite 
numbers 206-8, the same floor and 
building, the Wilson Building, just 
across the hall from his old office, 
where he will be better prepared 
to accommodate the public. 


A MAMMOTH EDITION COMING 


The twelfth anniversary edition 
of The TAberator will be published 
April 1st. It will be a mammoth 
edition and will contain hundreds 
of portraits of the leading colored 
men of the state. Ministers, law¬ 
yers, Doctors, Merchants and men 
who are making their marks in 
many callings. In men who have 
done things, California leads the 
Pacific Coast. Cuts of many of 
the splendid homes owned by the 
colored people will also appear. 
Churches, lodges, stores and offices 
of our business and professional 
men and women will testify as to 
the Negro’s splendid achievements 
in this wonderland of the great 
west. How a mere handful of 
colored people in this city grew to 
20,000 in 15 years, accumulating 
millions of wealth will be graphic¬ 
ally told. 

This mammoth edition will be 
mailed to every part of the civi¬ 
lized world and will be a perpetual 
memorial of Negro achievement. 


At a meeting held at 105 East 
First street a Roosevelt Club was 
formed with the following officers: 
W. E. Easton, president; J .Gor¬ 
don, McPherson, Vice-president, 
W. B. Coleman, secretary; H. 
Ballinger, treasurer; and J. Thos. 
Norris, chairman executive com¬ 
mittee. 

Resolutions endorsing Roosevelt 
were passed. The organization 
proposes no interest in local poli¬ 
tics other than to aid and sustain 
other racial organizations in defeat¬ 
ing means and men who are in¬ 
different to the colored man’s 
rights. 

(What has Roosevelt done that 
merits the unsought indorsement of 
the Negroes?—The Editor.)
