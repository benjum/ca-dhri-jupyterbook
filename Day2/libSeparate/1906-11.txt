A Square Deal for both the 
Living and the Dead. 



Dr. E. O. Sawyer, independent can 
didate for Coroner, had the novel dis¬ 
tinction during- the Blaine and Logan 
campaign of being- chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the Republi¬ 
can organization of Mason County, W. 
Va., that nominated and elected the 
first Republicans to take office after 
the Civil War. The Democrats were 
so incensed at Sawyer for his audacity 
that those of them engaged in busi¬ 
ness would not furnish his family with 
supplies. He scratched then for food 
even as he is scatching now for votes. 
He is making a good campaign # * * * 
and ought * * tu come out * best 

in the race.

Southern Whites Like 
Bad Negroes. 

FROM THE SOUTH WESTERN 
CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE. 

Tlie present condition of the Negro 
viewed from any standpoint is a hard 
one, taken from its setting and elim¬ 
inating God it is hopeless. But what 
if 10,000,000 Negroes lose hope? What 
if their meekness and humility become 
a fired desperation? What if these 
Negroes changing in their nature, do 
not sing, shout and laugh? What if 
the high cord of hope is broken? May 
God pull down the curtain on such a 
scene 

In spite of all the Negro must keep 
a stout heart. He must not be dis¬ 
couraged. The situation is bad enough, 
but it is not hopeless. If the Negro 
loses hope, then he can do nothing 
for himself, neither can any one else 
do anything for him. Hold your head 
above the waves! Atlanta is still on 
the map. Many.of our race are dead, 
but millions live. The schools are 
open, a few friends still abide; we 
have more racial strength in character 
aud progress today than ever before; 
the Bible is ours. Heaven is near. 
Much there is to discourage us, but 

more to give us hope. 

* * * 

A part of the game of the South is 
to crush the Negro’s spirit. If we 
drop our hands by our sides and say, 
“It’s no use,” then we enslave our 
children and our children’s children to 
a system of oppression from which no 
emancipation can free them. Freedom 
cannot be worked up from without. 
A slave is always a slave, until he 
desires to be free — and if he has the 
passion to be free he is free, though 
temporarily he may be in bondage. 
No, the South would curb our ambi¬ 
tions. If we were things and not men, 
all would be well. But men have 
wants ,needs, rights. Men think and 
grow in proportion as they think. 
There is no more antipathy between 
the races now than before the war, 
doubtless not as much. Then the 
Negro had nothing, wanted nothing 
and all went well. It was master and 
slave. And the white man would be 
friendly (?) now if he were permitted 
the relative position of master and 
slave. This never, NEVER! It’s the 
upward move of the Negro that gives 
the trouble. That’s the trouble in 
Atlanta. Oh, if the police authorities 
would, they could suppress every bad 
Negro in 24 hours. They have the 
laws and if they haven’t, then enact 
laws to suit the case. It is the weak¬ 
est cry imaginable for this white race 
—world rulers, world conquerors, su¬ 
perior people — with absolutely every 
branch of the government in their 
hands, to say that they can’t control 


a few worthless, idle Negroes. Why 
don’t they do it? Here is the reason: 
On the class of worthless Negroes 
some white men live and grow fat. 
Put these Negroes in jail and white 
men will bail them out. Let a bad 
Negro kill another Negro and some 
white man, if possible, will get the 
murderer out. Oh, no, the low-down, 
good-for-nothing Negro makes men. 
rich, and there are some people who’d 
sell their souls for gold. The danger 
is that we may be made to believe that 
all of us are bad, dangerous, worthless. 
This constant pounding that Negroes 
are thugs, thieves, rapists, has simply 
severed our friends from us (if friends 
they were, for friends will not forsake 
one when the pinch comes). But that 
would not be so bad, if the Negro is 
not convinced that he has no friends 
fcaywhere, and that his race is not i 
worthless one. 


SUCCESS OF A NEGRO. 

News from Chicago is to the effect 
that Henry O. Tanner, “a Negro ar¬ 
tist,” has been awarded a prize of five 
hundred ‘dollars for the best painting 
at a local exhibit. And to make the 
item more interesting, it is stated that 
the committee “went carefully over 
the large number of paintings hung,” 
and that the decision was unanimous. 
Who says the Negro race is not ad¬ 
vancing? 

It is to be hoped the committee 
knew, if the correspondent did not, 
that*. Henry O. Tanner is one of the 
most prominent painters in the world 
today. Several years ago, the French 
government purchased one of his can¬ 
vases for the Luxembourg. He is also 
represented in the famous Wilstach 
collection, the Carnegie Institute, and 
the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine 
Arts. 

We hear much of the success of 
Abbey, Sargent, the late Mr. Whistler, 
and other American artists, who have 
done practically all their work abroad. 
Their eminence would have been of 
slower accomplishment had they been 
handicapped as was Henry O. Tanner. 
Born in Pittsburg just before the war, 
he early developed remarkable genius. 
But he was a Negro, and society does 
not make pets of young Negro prodi¬ 
gies. So the road to success was not 
rendered easy for him. That he has 
reached the goal, in spite of every im¬ 
pediment, reflects the greater honor 
upon himself and his race. 

Tanner studied in Paris, under Jean. 
Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. 
His first “honorable mention” came to 
him at the salon of 1896. He -is ex¬ 
pected to do greater things,f or he is 
hardly yet in the prime of his powers.

ood White Men Lynch 
another Negro Rape 
fiend. 

NEGRO DRAGGED .TO DEATH. 

ROSWELL (N. M.), Oct. 26—“Slab” 
Pitts, a negro, who was run out of 
town two weeks ago, after serving 
ninety days for violation of the Ed¬ 
munds act, was lynched by cowboys . 
at Toyah, Tex. The accessory, a 
white woman, followed the negro to 
Toyah and they were living together. 
The cowboys went in the night and 
placed a rope around the neck of the 
Negro. He was dragged to death and 
then hanged. 

The above undoubtedly escaped the 
Associated Press censor or it would 
have told of the lynching of the burly 
Negro raping a ten-year-old white girl. 
The fact that the truth slipped out 
caused the daily papers to devote one 
inch of space to what would otherwise 
have been a choice bit of news. 999 
out of every 1,000 Negroes charged 
with rape are guilty of the same of¬ 
fense for which Pitts was lynched. No 
one knows this better than the “good” 
white folks who lynch the black brute 
that allows a white woman to seduce 
him. You see the white woman never 
reaches the age of consent if the man 
she gets after happens to have Negro 
blood in his veins. When a white wo¬ 
man is caught in a compromising posi¬ 
tion with a Negro the Negro is lynched 
for rape and the Associated Press 
usually transpoes the woman’s age if 
she is not married. For .instance if 
she is 21, her age is given as 12; if 18, 
the 1 is dropped and she is 8. In all 
cases where a girls is under 20 the 
unit only is used; this of course in¬ 
creases the heinousness of the crime. 


The colored voters will do well t 
look over the Non-Partisan ticket ht 
fore voting. They are trying to smas 
the machin'e, and it needs smashin 
badly. 


■ The Forum has been filled wit 
new blood t and is enjoying a season o 
great prosperity.. It is attracting to its 
meetings some of the best people in 
the city. The establishment of a bu¬ 
reau of correspondence bids fair to 
become one of the most valuable fea¬ 
tures. The bureau consists of the fol¬ 
lowing gentlemen: J., L. Edmonds, 
Dr. Cuming, Capt. Crnmbley, Rev-. E. 
T. Hubbard and J. Thomas Norris. In 
all works of charity the Forum takes 
the lead.

THE COLORED VOTERS DIDN’T 

TURN OUT—THE ALEXANDER 
RALLY A FIZZLE. 

Fifteen or more candidates on the 
Republican county ticket addressed 
25 colored voters at the Neimore, Alex¬ 
ander and Warner rally, given at 
Scott’s Hall on October 22nd. In spite 
of the small capacity of the hall there 
was not enough voters or enthusiasm 
present to heat the place up; as a re¬ 
sult there was an epidemic of cold 
feet. It must have cost the Republican 
campaign committee a dollar apiece for 
every voter who attended the rally. 
A postal card had been mailed to each 
voter urging him to be present.' To 
impress the voter with the absolute 
necessity of his being present each 
invitation closed with the meaningless 
phrase “Important interest.” The 
meeting had been extensively adver¬ 
tised by scattering dodgers like 
leaves, but all to no purpose, for the 
colored voter is no longer the sucker 
he used to be. 

Two Splendid Speeches. 

The speeches delivered by Sheriff 
Hammel and Supt. of Schools Prof. 
Mark Keppel were models. They 
would have edified any audience. They 
lent dignity to their authors and dig¬ 
nity to the audience. They had been 
prepared to be delivered to American 
citizens. The other speeches with pos¬ 
sibly one or more exceptions if they 
can be called speeches were gotten up 
for “the collored boys” and were mere 
appeals to the Negro’s supposed ig¬ 
norance and vanity. 

The Colored Votes He Gets Will Be 
Few. 

The colored voters all along the line 
will scratch Judge Pierce. His record 
in the civil rights cases tried before 
him has cooked his goose with the 
black men and women. His speech 
was characteristic mainly for his abun¬ 
dant use of slang; his charizations 
were coarse, and his sentences punc¬ 
tuated with curse words. 

This calls to mind the Judge’s grand 
Hand play in a matrimonial case. The 
acts are these: A white man called 
X the court house to have the Judge 
narry him. The Judge noticing that 
he handsome bride-to-be was of Afric- 
n descent, informed the white man 
hat it was against the law for whites 
md negroes to intermarry. The white 
nan, in order to make the bonnie 
olack woman his bride, so that he 
might revel in the sunshine of her 
charms, swore that he too was black. 
The Judge proceeded to deliver a 
harangue against the intermarriage of 
superiors and inferiors. O yes, the 
men who raped a whole race of women 
and gave this country millions of 
mulattoes are also bitterly opposed to 
amalgamation of the races. 

The Judge lost votes by his speech 
to “the colored boys.” It is remark¬ 


able how little the average Republican 
orator knows of the Negro. The Ne¬ 
gro is regarded by them as having 
made no advancement intelligently. 
They have arguments for white voters 
and taffy for the Negro voters. 

Why the Colored Voters Stayed Home. 

Alexander has himself to blame for 
the refusal of the colored voters to 
turn out The Afro-America council 
is supposed to be a race organization, 
independent in politics. Alexander, 
who is a chronic office seeker, backed 
by a small gang of job chasers, in¬ 
sulted the decent members of the race 
by turning the council into a Repub¬ 
lican club, over the protest of the 
men who were keeping it up. The 
gang took snap judgment by offering 
a resolution to endorse the Republican 
ticket without giving previous notice 
that such a move was to be made. The 
resolution was adopted by a vote of 7 
to 6. The minority representing the 
decent, self-respecting colored voters, 
while the majority represented a few 
self-seeking job chasers. With two of 
our brightest and best young men hon¬ 
ored by being placed on the Prohibi¬ 
tion ticket, the endorsement of the 
Republican ticket was ingratitude so 
base and race betrayal so brazen that 
a large number of league members 
handed in their resignations. That’s 
why the ministers and business and 
professional men issued an appeal to 
the colored voters to stand by the Pro¬ 
hibition ticket. That’s why the col¬ 
ored voters refused to attend the 
Alexander, Niemore, Warner meeting. 
Their attendance would have been re¬ 
garded as a ratification of the bargain 
and sale of the colored voters. A sort 
of taking stock. James Alexander has 
fallen by his own hand and has ele¬ 
vated James Mijler by the same 
stroke. 


THE ALEXANDER PUSH KNOCK¬ 
ING COL. ALLENSWORTH. 

While it was generally known that 
the Alexander push or the little gang 
of job chasers that is doing violence 
to the interest of the race under liis 
banner, were knifing every decent 
Afro-American who stands for race 
advancement, their fight upon Col. 
Allensworth came as a surprise. Col. 
Allensworth is not an aspirant for &ny 
office, hut is unselfishly giving his 
time to the upbuilding of the race. In 
the early part of the campaign the 
Colonel was named as delegate to the 
Republican state convention, but the 
Alexander push ordered it erased, 
which was done. After this he was 
booked as delegate to the congression¬ 
al convention. Then Alexander or one 
of his lieutenants gave the committee 
to understand that unless the Colonel’s 
name was* dropped its use would 
create jealousies among the colored 
voters. The Colonel’s name was again 


dropped and he was called upon to ex¬ 
plain as to the manner of men the 
colored voters are. At the late Afro- 
American state council an executive 
committee was created to watch the 
interest of the race during sessions of 
the legislature. Alexander’s friends 
urged the appointment of Col. Allens¬ 
worth as chairman of the committee 
because of his fitness, race loyalty and 
his willingness and ability to attend 
the legislative sessions. After leading 
them to believe that the Colonel would 
be appointed, he put him on the tail 
of the committee, appointing a chair¬ 
man who could not attend, thus male* 
ing the committee useless. Some 
time ago, Rev. L. G. Jordan, corres¬ 
ponding secretary of the National 
Afro-American council, sent through 
Mr. Alexander an appeal to the Afro- 
Americans of this state for contribu¬ 
tions to aid in the fight against race 
disfranchisement in the South. Dis¬ 
cussing this request before the local 
council, Alexander made slurring re¬ 
marks about Bishop Walters, national 
president, and said that he (Alexan¬ 
der) “was not going to send his money 
down South for those Negroes to ride 
out on trains.” 

The editor of this journal and sev¬ 
eral members administered to him the 
rebuke he needed. At the next meet¬ 
ing the appeal was read and seven¬ 
teen dollars was raised and forwarded 
to the National Council. 

Alex’s last break was when he and 
his gang wasted an hour of the local 
council’s time in an attack upon the 
colored Y. M. C. A., but the Y. M. C. 
A. was made stronger for their trai¬ 
torous knock, They knocked the race 
newspapers so hard that the Eagle, 
their own mouthpiece, could not get 
the Republican ticket as an ad. The 
Eagle to get enough money to support 
the Republican tiket had to publish 
the Prohibition ticket. 

Alexander and his gang of race 
knockers are in the position of the 
fool who perched upon a limb 50 feet 
from the ground severed the limb from 
the tree to spite the limb. 

It is now generally believed that the 
failure of the colored voters to get 
representation on the Republican * 
ticket is mainly due to the opposition 
of this gang. That’s why they are 
“again” the Prohibition ticket. 


The white woman who tried to get 
a divorce from her husband on the 
grounds that she had discovered him 
to be a Negro, showed that white 
women are not the equals of many 
white men who when they want to get 
rid of their wives they shoot them.

HOW WOULD LINCOLN VOTE 
WERE HE HERE? 

If the martyred Abraham Lincoln 
was in this city as a voter he would on 
November Gth vote the, Prohibition 
ticket and against every other man 
with the exception of Hammel for 
sheriff and Ward fpr assessor. As 
Lincoln would vote, every colored vot¬ 
er should vote. In view of the fact 
that the colored voters are going to 
split their tickets let them stamp 
Hammel for sheriff, Ward for assessor 
and Keppel for superintendent of 
schools and then vote the balance of 
the Prohibition ticket. If this is done 
the constitutional idghts of the black 
man will hereafter be fully respected 
in this section. The Prohibition party 
is entitled to the colored vote not only 
because its policy is best for the na¬ 
tion, but because it has honored them 
as no other party has. 

By nominating Theo W. Troy for 
county auditor and Attorney Chas S. 
Dardin for police justice it has given 
the colored yoters “a square deal." It 
is the only party that has in its plat¬ 
form an anti-lynching plank. If the 
other parties had wanted the Negro 
vote they would have given him the 
same consideration. They glory in 
talking about a square deal, hut they 
never give it. We mentioned the 
names of Hammel and Ward because 
they have given the Negro a square 
deal at every turn. Let us lump them 
in with the Prohibition ticket and vote 
solidly. 

That’s what Lincoln would do. 


MR. A. C. HARPER MAY BE OUR 
NEXT MAYOR. 

As the result of Democratic primar¬ 
ies, Hon. A. C. Harper will be the 
Democratic candidate for mayor with 
all of the chances of election in his 
favor. Messrs. Gates and Lindley are 
both Republicans and both are popu¬ 
lar. Mr. Gates of course is the can¬ 
didate of the Non-Partisans, but is a 
Republican just the same. Mr. Har¬ 
per is a prominent and popular busi¬ 
ness man and will not only poll the full 
Democratic vote, hut will poll possibly 
half as many Republican votes as 
either Lindley or Gates. 

Although reared and, educated in 
the West, Mr. Harper conies of an 
old and aristocratic family of Colum¬ 
bus, Mississippi. He comes of a class 
of white people that are everywhere 
friendly to the Negro. Besides know¬ 


ing Mr. Harper for years, we had the 
good fortune to know his ancestors in 
Mississippi. Mr. Harper is Western 
by adoption and education and there¬ 
fore is safe so far as the black man is 
concerned. 


IT LOOKS LIKE HEARST. 

Mr. Hearst is making a cam¬ 
paign in New York for the governor¬ 
ship such as has not been witnessed 
for years. In spite of the fact that 
the administration has thrown its en¬ 
tire weight into the contest the issue 
is in grave doubt at this writing. The 
Afro-Americans of the empire state 
are flocking to the Hearst standard. 
All the Afro-Americans have of poli¬ 
tical patronage in that state come 
through Tammany and to desert that 
standard for Hughes is throwing away 
bread for a stone. 

Mr. Hearst’s platform recognizes 
the equality of men. Mr. Hughes’ 
platform is made of the remains of 
former broken Republican promises. 
The further fact that Hughes has the 
endorsement of President Roosevelt 
is an argument in favor of Mr. Hearst. 
Here’s hoping that he wins. 


NO DISCRIMINATION FOR THE 
JAPS. 

The attempt of the Negro haters to 
draw the color line on the Japanese 
in the public schools of San Francisco 
failed dismally. The Negro haters 
have been taught a wholesome lesson 
and one they do well to heed and that 
they can draw the color line on the 
American citizens of color, but they 
cannot draw it on the Japs. The 
President, who has been silent to the 
appeals of colored American citizens 
for protection from mobs that are de¬ 
stroying their lives and property every 
day shivered /in hisi boots when the. Japs 
protested against the attempted denial 
of their treaty rights, and sent a cab¬ 
inet officer to inquire into the affair. 
He cabled to Japan that the Japanese 
in this country would be fully pro¬ 
tected. 

The attitude of this nation toward 
the Negro and his rights is the scan¬ 
dal of the age. This is the first na¬ 
tion in the history of the world that 
while having full power to protect all 
foreigners residing in its borders had 
no power to protect its own citizens. 
This whole governmental policy tow¬ 
ard its colored citizens is a disgrace¬ 
ful, cowardly farce. A nation that ac¬ 
cepts a man’s services and blood in 
its defense in time of peril and refuses 
to protect him in his inalienable 
rights, puts a premium upon treason 
and anarchy. The negro haters have 
at last found some dark-skinned peo¬ 
ple whose rights they are bound to 
respect.

J. MAX BARBER, BRILLIANT EDI¬ 
TOR OF THE VOICE OF THE 
NEGRO, DRIVEN FROM 
ATLANTA. 

Hon. J. Max Barber, the brilliant 
editor of the Voice of the Negro, has 
been driven from Atlanta, Ga., his 
home, for daring to tell the truth 
about the Atlanta riot. “The Voice ot 
The Negro/’ the ablest race magazine 
in the country, has been suppressed 
and all Barber possessed in this world 
destroyed. With the Associated Press 
in the hands of the mob, it is n'ow a 
part of the plot to suppress every Ne¬ 
gro paper that has the backbone to 
publish the true condition of things 
in the South. As the first steps toward 
the re-enslavement of the Negro in the 
South, free speech and free press are 
to be suppressed, and the world is to 
know nothing of the Negro but what 
the mob sends out. Wherever the 
Negro’s advancement along intellec¬ 
tual, moral and material lines is con¬ 
sidered too rapid, white men will black 
themselves and make fake assaults 
anywhere, and that his race is not a 
worthless one. 


THE COLORED VOTE DIVIDED. 

One of the most encouraging things ‘ 
connected with the present campaign 
is the fact that the Afro-Americans 
are divided and will vote just as white 
men. In this campaign the question 
among the colored voters has' been 
men, not parties. The colored voter 
is more concerned about his rights 
than he is about the success of the 
Republican ticket. Ten years ago we 
undertook the task of dividing the 
colored voters and taking the Repub¬ 
lican collar from their necks. The 
collar is broken and the Negro run¬ 
ning at large will vote as he pleases. 
Glory to God in the highest.

The nomination of Troy and Dardin 
on the Prohibition ticket puts the col¬ 
ored voters on their merits. If the 
increase in the Prohibition vote at the 
coming election shows that it received 
the colored vote there will be no trou¬ 
ble in getting representation in the 
future. Try it

Wanted—Our business and profession¬ 
al people to get together and father and 
promote enterprises for the employment 
of young folks. If our college-trained 
men and women cannot get together for 
the advancement of the race, whither 
are we drifting ? 

Wanted—At once; an Afro-American 
daily paper published in this city. While 
the paper need not be as large as the 
Times and Examiner, it would do more 
good in manufacturing sentiments in fa¬ 
vor of a “square deal” for our people 
than all of the white papers in the city. 
The tendency of the daily papers to cir¬ 
culate damaging falsehoods against us 
is becoming too prevalent. With no. ap¬ 
parent reason, some of our city dailies 
that have been friendly to us, are now 
molding sentiment against us.
