Mayor Alexander’s Record one of 
Ingratitude to the Negroes 


In spite of the fact: that but for 
the Negro vote, Mayor Alexander 
would years ago, have been con¬ 
signed to political perdition, the 
Negroes' rights have been less 
respected and they have received 
more rebuffs during his (Mayor 
Alexander's administration) than 
in any administration in the city's 
history. As far as the Negroes' 
rights are concerned the present 
admistration has been the most 
disastrous and is becoming more 
so each day. 

Negro Saves Him From Political 
Death. 

During the year 1904 the machine 
then in control of the Republican 
party decided to politically kill 
Mr. Alexander who was then a 
member of the Board of Supervi¬ 
sors and candidate for renomina¬ 
tion. In the convention of that 
summer, he was hit by the steam 
rollers and ruthlessly crushed. 

This treatment aroused the sym¬ 
pathy of his friends who induced 
him to run independently. The edi¬ 
tor of this journal who undertook the 
task in 1896 of liberating the Ne¬ 
groes from corrupt machine in¬ 
fluences, took up the mayor's fight 
The independent sentiment that 
The Liberator had created among 
the colored citizens gave Mr. Alex¬ 
ander the independent colored vote. 

In The Liberator of Oct. 
1904, appeared the following editor¬ 
ial which was read by seventy 
five per cent of the colored voters: 
MR, ALEXANDER'S POSITION. 

“The position of Mr. Alexander is 
one that every good citizen can well en¬ 
dorse. He is a temperance man, not a 
Prohibitonist. On the saloon question he 
favors local option—that is, if the people 


of a locality want a saloon just let them 
have it. But if they don’t want a saloon, 
no licence should be granted. The 
fight of the Los Angeles Lighting Company 
upon him grew out of his vote to give the 
Lowe Gas Company a franchise which 
means cheaper gas to the people by letting 
in a competing company. Mr. Alexander 
stands for honesty and fair play. He is 
patriotic and safe/' 

In the same edition the following 
is the report of a mass meeting 
held in the interest of the mayor's 
candidacy. The editor of this 
journal with a number of gentle¬ 
men got up the meeting: 

“COLORED VOTERS ENDORSE 

ALEXANDER FOR SUPERVISOR. 


A TRIBUTE PAID TO MAYOR SNYDER 


MR. ALEXANDER ENDORSED 

At a large, enthusiastic meeting of 
the representative colored voters held 
at Scott’s Hall, Mr. Alexander, non¬ 
partisan candidate to succeed himself 
as member of the Board of Supervisors, 
was endorsed. The meeting was made 
up of all trades, ministers of the gospel, 
laymen, business and professional men, 
brick layers, plasterers, hod carriers, 
painters, paper-hangers, politicians and 
representatives of every honorable walk 
of life. 

The ablest speech of the evening was 
delivered by Mr. Henry Burdette in de¬ 
fense of Mr. Lauder's candidacy. Mr. 
Burdette, like his great namesake, is 
indeed an orator, but his friend and can¬ 
didate, the creature of the machine, had 
no show in that meeting held, as it was, 
to promote the interest of good govern¬ 
ment. He was followed by the president, 
who discussed the issues involved in the 
contest. After the vote was taken Mr. 
Alexander was sent for and presented to 
the meeting by a committee. He made 
a modest, striaghtforward speech. Of 
Mr. Alexander's election there is not the 
least doubt. 

Mr. Burdette paid a splendid tribute 
to Mayor Snyder for his kindness and 
friendship for the colored citizens. 


That endorsement made the de¬ 
feat of Mr. Lauder certain, as it 
was known that he could not 
win without the solid negro vote. 
The effect of that endorsement 
was to bring into the Alexander 
camp every undecided white voter. 
He had a plurality of 500, just 
about the size of the Negro vote 
that left the machine. 

In 1908 Mr. Alexander fell into 
a trap set for him by the machine 
and was sent to private life. 

Being resurrected from his poli¬ 
tical grave to run as Recall candi¬ 
date against Mayor Harper, the 
colored voters again went to his 
rescue. The Negro vote again gave 
him the victory. 

In 1909 the machine, driven to 
desperation, nominated George A. 
Smith to run against the Mayor. 
Again the colored voters held the 
balance of power and the machine 
fight for that vote became bitter. 

As president of the Independent 
Political League, a Negro organi¬ 
zation, the editor of this journal 
called a meeting of that body and 
the following resolutions were unani¬ 
mously adopted. 

Dear Sir:— 

Your attention is respectfully 
called to the fact that it is neces¬ 
sary for you to cast your ballot 
on Tuesday, December 7th, next 
for those candidates who will give 
to Los Angeles a clean well governed 
City, for that is our hope in mak¬ 
ing advancement as a race; it 
throws around our homes the 
greatest amount of protection and 
enables our children to be in a 
municipality where their welfare 
is carefully considered. 











m 


TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


We, therefore, earnestly call 
upon you to seriously consider how 
you will cast your vote and in 
doing so, will be guided by the 
following resolutions, viz: 

WHEREAS, it is our belief that 
the best asset that a city can have 
is a reputation of being well gov¬ 
erned and 

WHEREAS, we, as Negro voters 
find it to the best interest of our 
race to live in cities with a clean 
municipal government, that mob 
rule, riot and race disturbances 
are things unheard of in cities where 
the law is properly enforced, and 

WHEREAS, we believe that 
those candidates nominated at the 
recent primary election through 
the efforts of the Good Govern¬ 
ment Organization will give Los 
Angeles an honest, economical and 
efficient government, 

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLV¬ 
ED, that we, the members of the 
Negro Independent Political League 
of Los Angeles, appeal to all voters 
of our race to use their influence 
for good government in the com¬ 
ing campaign, and 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, 
that we endorse the candidates 
named by the Good Government 
Organization and headed by George 
Alexander for mayor and that we 
will use our efforts and influence 
to bring about their election and 
make of Los Angeles a city whose 
municipal officers are not controlled 
by a corporation machine subject 
to influences that stand for vice 
and graft. 

J. L. EDMONDS, President 
E. F. HENDERSON, sec. 

J. L. Edmonds and G. Walter 
Snell were appointed by the League 
as a committee to visit the colored 
ministers meeting and secure if 
possible their endorsement of the 
resolutions. 

They were endorsed by Revs. 
J. T. Hill, C. H. Anderson, J. D. 
Gordon, L. M. Hagood, E. F. 
Henderson and C. C. Flint and A. 
J. Jones, business men. Thus en¬ 
dorsed 10,000 copies were printed 


and distributed among the colored 
voters and the campaign was re¬ 
lentlessly pressed both night and 
day till victory was won. 

The Mayor’s “Cold Shoulder.” 

No sooner had the mayor found 
himself safely in office than he 
began in rustic parlance to turn 
his “cold shoulder” to his colored 
supporters. He became irre¬ 
proachable. Negroes holding re¬ 
sponsible positions in the city were 
gradually let out. All of the teams 
owned by Negroes were taken off 
the street, the Negroes were all 
let out of the parks save one. 
All appeals made to the mayor 
were swept aside by the statement 
that he was powerless or that he 
was handicapped by race preju¬ 
dice. This favorite subterfuge, the 
creature of the imagination of 
Good Government officials, has 
been over-worked by the present 
administration as an excuse for 
denying the Negroes opportunities 
they enjoyed before they put the 
mayor in office. 

Refuses Negro Representation 

The thirst for money has made 
many of the operators of the 
picture shows so depraved that 
a censor board has been created 
by the city council to censor their 
pictures to keep them from cor¬ 
rupting the morals of little boys 
and girls by exhibiting lewd pic¬ 
tures. These crime breeding shows 
are all run by white men. A favor¬ 
ite practice among these propoga- 
tors of vice is the exhibition of 
brutal lynching scenes where Ne¬ 
groes are victims. In spite of 
the immoral effect that these scenes 
must have upon the minds of child¬ 
ren, the white people offered no 
protest against these exhibitions. 
Burning a Negro at the stake was 
exhibited without hinderance 
till protested against by Negroes. 

To prevent the recurrence of 
these appeals to race prejudice the 
mayor was asked to appoint a 
colored man on the Censor Com¬ 
mission, so as to protect the city's 


youths from such outrages. As 
the white people had offered no 
protest against these exhibitions 
in the past there was ample reason 
for the request of the colored 
citizens for representation on the 
commission. As there is no salary 
attached to the office, it was thought 
the appointment would be made 
without hesitation as right was also 
on the side of the request. It 
was turned down—“race preju¬ 
dice” was given as the reason. 
The mayor said, if he appointed 
a Negro on that commission the 
other members would resign. And 
yet, he said the commission was 
composed of broad, capable, jus¬ 
tice-loving persons among whom 
is a minister of the gospel. In 
the name of high Heaven what 
kind of gospel does that minister 
preach? Could such a commis¬ 
sion be intrusted with the rights 
of anybody? Are these persons 
members of any church? From 
whence came they? It is the 
policy of the Good Government 
officials to appoint the Negro to 
no position that carries with it 
a recognition of manhood. 
Is there any difference in the count 
of the votes cast for him by Neg¬ 
roes than those cast by white men?

do a little thinking. He can per¬

THE BOOKER T. WASHINGTON 
ART CLUB 


The Second Semi-Annual exhi¬ 
bition of the Booker T. Washington 
Art Club was held at the West¬ 
minister Presbyterian church on 
the 29th of February. On that 
occasion all former exhibitions were 
eclipsed: beautifully embroidered 
table covers, center pieces, pillow 
covers, gowns, baby coats, aprons, 
towels, handkerchiefs and other 
articles too numerous to mention. 
The space occupied by the exhibit 
was twice that occupied six months 
ago, and everything showed im¬ 
provement both in taste and finish. 

One of the attractions that chal¬ 
lenged the admiration of all visi¬ 
tors was a splendid solid oak office 
desk made by Mr. John Perry, 
a student of the Manual Arts 
school. This finely finished piece 
of furniture would lend grace to 
most any office. Mr. Perry is 
the director of a juvenile orchestra 
which treated the audience with 
a selection, the music of which 
was composed by Mr. Perry. 

Besides her needlework, Mrs. M. 
A. Toney exhibited a copy of 


the Vicksburg, Mississippi Daily 
Citizen published July 2nd, 1863, 
two days before that city with 
30,000 Confederate soldiers, 1,500 
of whom wore the title of general, 
surrendered to General Grant. 
These papers printed on wall paper, 
fell into the hands of union sol¬ 
diers and were distributed among 
them and kept as souvenirs. Mr. 
Toney was a drummer-boy and 
witnessed some of the bloodiest 
battles of the war. 

To better preserve the paper 
Mrs. Toney had it enclosed in a 
neat frame with a glass front. 
It is worth reading. Its views of 
the Yankies and the north are 
somewhat vitrolic. It tells of 
floi^r at $5 a pound and molasses 
at $10 per gallon. 

Among the many visitors at the 
exhibition were: Mr. Washington 
Reed of Wellston, St. Louis Co., 
Missouri, a veteran of the civil 
. war; Capt. and Mrs. F. H. Crumbly 
—Capt. Crumbly is a veteran of 
the Spanish American war—Mrs. 
L. E. Hudson, Mrs. Fowler and 
Mrs. Frank Ross. 

Another young man of promise 
in the Presbyterian church is Mr. 


Dewey L. Johnson, president of 
the J unior Christian Endeavor. 
There are 50 members in his society. 
Rev. N. W. Cobb and Mr. F. 
W. Alexander are influential mem¬ 
bers of the Art Club. 

The following are the officers: 
Mrs. O. Johnson, president; Mrs. 
J. W. Payne, vice-president; Mrs. 
R. C. Bell, corr. secretary; Mrs. 
M. A. Toney, treasurer; Mrs. S. 
Davis, financial secretary; Mrs. 
Z. Johnson, recording secretary; 
The work these ladies are doing 
while increasing the dexterity of 
the hand, develops the finer sense 
and nobler side of the human char- 
character. Already the whole 
community feels the effects of 
the Club’s presence. Rev. Hol¬ 
man the pastor, deserves congratu¬ 
lation for the splendid community 
of which his church is the social 
center.
