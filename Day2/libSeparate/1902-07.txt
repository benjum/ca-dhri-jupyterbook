THE) LIBERATOR. 


Mr. W. H. Anderson 
the Man from Texas 
Writes a Letter 


Brings Some Ugly Senti¬ 
ments from the State 
of Negro Burners. 

In a letter written to the Times dat¬ 
ed July 2, Mr. W. H. Anderson, who 
comes to the rescue of Senator Bailey 
and other Texas law breakers, said 
among other things: “Texas is not 
lawless. It is not a place “where they 
eat fire.” It is not a state of “Negro- 
burners” nor of “devotees of Judge 
Lynch.” There, as here, and as else¬ 
where throughout the Union, some 
frightful crime has occasionally out¬ 
raged the public as to invite swift and 
merited punishment upon the criminal. 
In one instance, there was a Negro 
burned—burned for the unthinkable 
outrage, fully confessed, of deflower¬ 
ing a four-year-old baby, and then 
rending her limb from limb in mere 
brutish wantonness.” 

The Negro, Henry Smith, referred 
to above, was known to be insane. 
There is no truth in the assault charge 
That was made as an excuse for the 
brutality displayed. Smith had been 
beaten over the head with a slub in 


the hands of 

Vance the 

child’s 

father 

until 

he was insensible. 

This 

beating 

and habitual 

drink 

made 

Smith 

a dangerous 

luna- 


tic. * * * “Great evils require strin¬ 
gent remedies. At times the law, 
however admirable its general admin¬ 
istration, is too slow of foot to over¬ 
take with deterrent effect the perpetra¬ 
tors of certain crimes. In its ordi¬ 
nary enforcement through the custom¬ 
ary channels it has no terror for these 
fiends incarnate—it neither serves to 
punish them for the given offense nor 
to deter others, whose only restraint is 
physical fear, from emulating their 
bad eminence.” 

This is anarchy with a vengeance. 
Can law be upheld by setting it aside? 
When the laws are set aside what have 
we? Is the community that sets the 
laws aside any better than an indi¬ 
vidual that does it? How long would 
Mr. Anderson’s wife and daughter be 
safe, if he has any, if his-doctrine was 


put in practice? What would be the 
state of society? How long would he 
be safe if his theories were univer¬ 
sally adopted? Will the day of freaks 
never end? Only the laws can punish 
crime. Mobs can commit crimes, but 
are powerless to punish them. 

He continues: “In recent years Cali¬ 
fornia has been the theater of many 
famous and brutal crimes. Durrant, 
Dunham, Hoff (of the name unpronouc- 
able,) Worden, the Downey murderer 
and others form a galaxy of world- 
famous criminals; yet theirs were the 
acts of individuals,not of the commun¬ 
ity, and would not warrant thoughtless 
wholesale denounciation of the state 
by any conservator of public morals.” 

Durrant paid the penalty of his 
crime long ago and the other mur¬ 
derers named in the above catagory 
will go over the same route if cap¬ 
tured. The fact that these murderers 
murdered their victims single-handed 
and alone makes them no less guilty 
than had they been .members of a 
mob at the time of their commission. 
They would have had to face a jury 
trial and depend upon a lawless public 
sentiment for escape as the Modocs 
did. In California all murderers are 
tried and many punished,whether mob 
or individuals. If mobs have gone un¬ 
punished in this state it was due to 
the dangerous sentiment that Mr. An¬ 
derson stands for and advocates. In 
Texas, where his sentiment pre¬ 
vails with respect to' negroes, al¬ 
though mobs have murdered hund¬ 
reds of defenseless Negroes and burn¬ 
ed five at the stake with unspeakable 
barbarity, not one of the thousands 
who took part in them has been tried 
or punished. The people of Texas 
would doubtless punish These murder¬ 
ers if they knew that lynching is a 
crime. On account of Mr. Anderson’s 
sentiment, life and property are at low 
ebb in Texas and many other portions 
of the south. A California township 
would buy a Texas congressional dis¬ 
trict. 

He concludes as follows: “Texas is 
law-abiding—as much so as any state 
in the Union. Her criminal laws are 
excellent and well administered. The 
decisions of her Court of Criminal Ap¬ 
peals rank as authority among the 
very first. Civilly she maintains the 
rights of her citizens with a master 
hand. Corruption in her courts is 
practically unknown. They are nei¬ 
ther throttled by corporations nor dic¬ 
tated to by political bosses. She is one 
of the great galaxy of sisters who 


form the Union; and her citizens are 
manly, self-respecting,law-abiding Am¬ 
erican * * * s 

“Respectfluuy, 

“W. H. ANDERSON.” 
Now, if what he says of the Texas 
courts is true, what is the use of mobs 
in that haven of justice? It may be 
that negroes are lynched from habit. 
If the Texas courts punish criminals, 
why is it that lynchers and negro- 
burners go unwhipped of justice? Did 
the scores of negroes that have been 
lynched in Texas have the protection of 
the laws? There is evidenly a 
cog broke in Mr. Anderson’s 
reasoning machine. The first Negro 
burned at the stake was burned in 
Texas. Pour others have been burn¬ 
ed in that state. Of the 19 negroes 
burned at the stake in this country 17 
were burned in the south and two in 
the west. Mr. Anderson’s sentiment 
has done well. While welcoming him 
to this state, California does not wel¬ 
come his sentiment. For the sake of 
our property valuation, of for no other 
reason, his sentiment cannot be en¬ 
tertained.

/'the Afro-Americans of this city 
have now two papers, one monthly 
and a weekly: The Liberator and The 
Enterprise. These journals have a 
splendid field and an appreciative con¬ 
stituency. The colored people of this 
city are extensive readers and are lib¬ 
eral supporters of race journals. If 
they forget to pay a subscription it is 
because the paper is unworthy of 
support.

REPUBLICAN MARCHERS MEET. 

The B. K. Bruce Republican March¬ 
ing club, J. B. Loving president, held 
another large and enthusiastic meet¬ 
ing last night. The Executive Co,m- 
mittee was appointed as follows: J. J. 
Neimore, George Warner, J. Thomas 
Norris, Isaac Hall, H. Batie, H. Bur¬ 
dette, B. F. Talbot, J. W. Coleman. 

It. is anticipated that much interest 
will be manifested in the next meet¬ 
ing, to be held at No. 243 San Pedro 
street, Thursday evening, the 10th 
inst., as the club promises to declare 
its choice for Governor of the state 
and Sheriff of the county.—Times

The Report of the fin¬ 
ance Committee Causes 
a Storm at the Zion 
A. M. E. Church. 

Some Money that Didn’t 
Show Up. 

The lines have not fallen in pleas¬ 
ant places for the old finance commit¬ 
tee and it is beginning to realize the 
force of the scriptural injunction,“The 
way of the wicked is hard.” The re¬ 
port of the finance committee of the 
Zion wing of the Wesley Chapel Ben¬ 
evolent Society turned the Zion A. M. 
E. church into a Pelee a few nights 
ago. It seepas that the committee that 
has been handling the finances which 
consisted of Mr. Shores, the president, 
and Mr. Sellers, the treasurer, has 
gone wrong. As is usually the 
case, with these self-appointed com¬ 
mittees, the treasury sprung a leak. 
In this case some two hundred dollars 
got through the hole. 

This discovery was made through a 
demand on Treasurer Sellers by the 
parent organization, which was recent¬ 
ly chartered, for all money and other 
property belonging to it in his posses¬ 
sion. The treasurer was $250 short in 
his accounts, and in his report he turn¬ 
ed state’s evidence against President 
Shores and’ said that he had repeat¬ 
edly dreamed that he and the president 
were occupying cells at San Quentin. 
The scene that followed the report is 
hard to describe. The noise resembled 
a mad-house hop. As a re-sult, 
President Shores was stripped as 
clean of authority as an angel is of 
sins. This brought Rev. Hawkins, the 
pastor, to the president’s rescue, for it 
was a flank movement on his base of 
suplies. A charge by some member 
that the minister had not been with¬ 
out fault and that his ministerial robe 
is becoming somewhat dingy drove him 
from the field*, and the batle was lost. 
The position of treasurer of several 
colored benevolent societies of late 
has been hotly contested. It has fre¬ 
quently transpired that the treasurers 
get the benevolence. “It is just like 
finding the money.” 

-o- 

THAT TEXAS STEER. 

“The editor of the Eagle has been 
asked to resent—what if coming from 
one worthy of our steel, would be a 
flagrant insult. The matter‘referred to 


was in reference to the grand outing 
and celebration at Verdugo Park. As 
the editor has not seen the article he 
is not prepared to APPLY to it speci¬ 
fically. But being apprised of the 
source from which it EMINATED it 
suffices to say from the putrid and dis¬ 
eased mind only vituperatious matter 
can be expected —The Eagle^ 

The above from our “Try Weekly” 
contemporary is self explanatory. If 
the editor of that amusing attempt at 
journalism—that huge joke known as 
The Eagle, would study the columns 
of The Liberator, he would know how 
to spell “emanate” and when to use 
the word “apply,” and The Eagle 
would not be so generally regarded as 
a conglomeration and dumped into 
the waste basket without having its 
jacket removed. When the Eagle man 
strayed from the shoemaker’s bench 
and started on his grammar smashing 
tour the old shoes lost a friend, but 
paper—it was an evil day for inno¬ 
cent paper and a “black Friday” for 
the Negroes of this city. For like his 
traditional wide horned partner of holy 
writ, unfitted to go himself, he has 
stood in the way of every proposition 
for the advancement of the people 
with whom he is identified to their 
detriment. To see that fleet-footed ex¬ 
shoe tinker, better know as wing foot, 
running around with his coat tail 
dangling in the wind struggling 
for the advancement of the Ne¬ 
groes by inducing them to quit 
work to attend a fake celebration 
so he can print “de bills” and appoint 
the “finance committee,” is indeed am¬ 
using. To hoodwink the business men 
whose legs are being pulled the name 
of every prominent Negro in the city 
of every preacher and prominent 
Negro in the city with which 
is printed on a yellow circular as 
committee men. This shady business 
would have gotten him into lots of 
trouble, but the names unlawfully used 
were so badly handled that their own¬ 
ers could not identify them. If there 
is any job press in this city that has 
earned its title it is that harmless look¬ 
ing one in the Eagle’s nest, for it has 
not only spoiled heaps of paper, but 
has “jobbed” nearly every person in 
the city. 


A MAN OF GREAT FORTITUDE. 

With all that can be said for and 
against this shoemaker of other days, 
it is admitted by all that he is a man 
of remarkable fortitude and can stand 
any amount of hard, laborious rest 
without the slightest complaint. Since 
he quit fooling with work and set 
out to entrap bread by aggravating the 
pen in utter disregard of the spelling 
book and grammar, his struggles have 
been such as to excite the sympathy 
rather than the envy of his fellow 
travelers. He simply floundered from 
one failure to another. In the palmy 
days of old* “black push” he was in 
the swim, till the editor of this jour¬ 


nal drove most of the gang out of town. 
He next mounted the Afro-American 
League and rode it to death. Then 
came his “racial celebration” scheme, 
a bare faced attempt to make a living 
by inducing people to quit work. The 
Liberator’s expose of his last fake has 
so badly shattered his future prospects 
that with his usual foresight he has 
“jined” the “B. K. Bruce Marching 
Club.” He has a s*olid foundation and 
will make a “bully” marcher. Now 
that this wily Texan is once more cor¬ 
ralled let those who pray for the err¬ 
ing fervently plead for the fulfillment 
of that beautiful declaration that 
“While the lamp holds out to burn, 
the vilest sinner may return.”

THE WOMAN’S CLUB. 


The dumb-bell drill to be given at 
the Azusa street church July 24th 
promises to be a pleasant affair. There 
will be a week of entertainments com¬ 
mencing July 21. The Woman’s Club 
and Improvement Association in in fine 
condition. A new set of officers were 
recently elected. Mrs. C. I. Clark¬ 
son, the retiring president made 
a splendid officer, and her ad¬ 
ministration marks the most pros¬ 
perous period in the club’s history. 
The club has just finished Whittier’s 
“Snow Bound.” The study of Ameri¬ 
can authors has greatly increased its 
attendance, and much is being done 
by the teacher, Rev. Edwards, to stim¬ 
ulate a taste for pure literature. The 
club meets each Wednesday evening. 
These meetings are open to all and 
should be largely attended. Rev. Ed¬ 
wards should feel proud of the book 
lovers that he has drawn around him. 
Those whose lives attract to them the 
intelligent and cultured possess some 
elements of leadership. 

-o- 

AND NEIMORE QUITS. Mr. J. J. 
Neimore, ( state lecturer of what used 
to be the Afro-American League, has 
joined the B. K. Bruce Marching Club, 
This is conclusive proof of the timely 
demise of the League, for rats always 
desert a sinking ship. Neimore never 
lets go a pap until it has been sucked 
dry. Things will be doing in the 
Marching Club as soon as Neimore ex¬ 
amines the lay of the land.

A PERIOD OF UNPARALLELED 
PROGRESS. 

The steady progress made by this 
city in the past decade in population, 
wealth and extent has been unparal¬ 
leled by any city on the coast and is 
a source of pride to its business men 
and citizens. Its marvelous growth 
is due mainly to its wide-awake, ener¬ 
getic business men, w T ho by making a 
success in their business were en¬ 
abled to make every cause they 
espoused succeed. None has contrib¬ 
uted more to make this city what it 
is than the proprietor of the great 
London Clothing store. First-class 
goods, square dealings and samll prof¬ 
its is the talisman that has made this 
the most popular clothing house in 
the city. A large stock, embracing 
every department of first class cloth¬ 
ing for men and boys, straight deal¬ 
ing, low prices and polite service make 
it a desirable place to do business. 
Like other successful business men, 
this firm has advertised extensively 
and has been liberal in patronizing 
colored papers. Their place of busi¬ 
ness, 117 to 127 North Spring street, is 
well known to all wearers of nobby 
clothes.

Mr. Geo. E. Watkins, the brilliant 
editor of The Pacific Coast Appeal of 
San Francisco, spent several days in 
the city this month. Mr. Watkins is 
well known and popular in Southern 
California and he always receives a 
cordial greeting on his annual visit to 
this section. The editorials of The 
Appeal are well written, broad and 
forceful. He deals with all of the pub¬ 
lic questions in a manner that shows 
him to be a thinker, and his paper 
holds a high place among the journals 
of the coast.

The death of Lawyer Oglesby of 
Oakland, which occurred in that city 
on the 6th of this month, removes 
from the scene of human activity a 
bright young man. ' As a lawyer he 
had been signally successful and life 
promised him much distinction in his 
chosen profession.

It is as difficult to elevate a race 
with advice alone as it is to satisfy a 
hungry stomach with it. 


MR. G. W. GLOVER: Now that 

Pasad-ena is trotting out a fine array 
of favorite sons for political prefer¬ 
ment, why doesn’t South Pasadena 
bring out Mr. G. W. Glover, editor of 
The South Pasadenan, for the assem¬ 
bly? Mr. Glover is a public spirited 
citizen and has done much to make 
that coming municipality what it is. 
Besides many minor positions, Pasa¬ 
dena has a member of congress, a su¬ 
perior judge and the county clerk. 
South Pasadena is certainly entitled 
to something, and the only way to suc¬ 
ceed in this matter is to make her 
wants known. South Pasadena is 
richly endowed- with the things that 
are necessary to ,make a strong muni¬ 
cipality. Editor Glover is popular and 
will make an ideal candidate.

The attempt to blacken the charac¬ 
ter of Governor Gage by charging him 
with petty larceny will fail of its pur¬ 
pose. It is bad politics. The people 
will not endorse it. 

The Panama canal bill has become a 
law and a great inter-ocean water¬ 
way seems now certain. Its effect in 
cheapening freight between California 
and East will add thousands to its 
wealth and poulation. With national 
irrigation and the Panama canal com¬ 
plete the future of this section is 
bright. 

Senator Bailey's cowardly attack up¬ 
on Senator Beveridge is in keeping 
with the ;mob spirit that is prevalent 
in his section. That brutal spirit that 
disregards the rights of Negroes will 
soon disregard the rights of white 
men. Brooks, Tilman and Bailey have 
not only disgraced the senate but the 
decent people of the south. 

-o- 

OUR MINISTERS. 

The practice of using the names of 
colored ministers to promote 5 question¬ 
able schemes is not only criminal, but 
shows a lack of respect for them that 
is simply shameful. To make use of 
their names without their consent, as 
has been done time and again, is more 
criminal than it would be to enter 
their homes and jmake use of their 
wearing apparel without their knowl¬ 
edge. A. minister's clothing might he 
ruined without serious damage to him, 
but to associate his name with every 
fraudulent scheme that promises its 
originator a few ill-gotten dollars is 
to inflict upon him no small injury. 
What is true of a minister is equally 
true of other men. As a whole the col¬ 
ored pulpits of this city are creditably 
filled, the lives of our ministers being 
such as to command respect, and they 
are justly indignant at the way in 
which their names have been used for 
private gain. A minister who would 
allow the use of his name for the pur¬ 
pose of defrauding the people is a pul¬ 
pit .merchant, unworthy of confidence. 
The names of the white ministers are 
never found backing up the schemes of 
dead- beats and ward heelers. 


INCREASE IN ASSESSED VALUA¬ 
TION. 

Figures Indicate the Remarkable 
Growth of the City.

kinds within the city is assessed at 
$85,670,822, as compared with $70,116,- 
540 for last year. These figures cor¬ 
rectly show the improvement and- 
growth of the city. 

The total valuation is made up of 
the following items: Land, $46,850,955; 
improvements, $22,738,315; secured and 
unsecured personal property, includ¬ 
ing money, $16,081,512; mortgage de¬

mr. t. m. McClellan. 


Among the leading citizens and lo¬ 
cal politicians few are better known 
and- higher respected than Mr. McClel¬ 
lan. As can be seen from a glance at 
his cut, he is a broad public-spirited 
gentleman and has contributed liber¬ 
ally of his time and means to every 
cause for the betterment of his race. 
In fact he is liberal to a fault. If 
there is one thing that entitles him to 
special mention in this sketch it is his 
devotion to the church and the cause 
for which it stands. He is a member 
of the Wesley Chapel, M. E. church, 
and, in truth, one of its pillars. He 
was a member of that now beautiful 
church when it existed merely as an 
expectation, and took a leading part 
in making it what it is now, the most 
desirable piece of church property 
held by the colored people of this city. 
In the benevolences of the church, as 
well as in the other departments, his 
influence has been felt in making them 
successful. As an officer of the church 
he has ever stood between it and those 
avaricious people who would use the 
house of worship for private specula¬ 
tion,and has been camping on the trail 
of the “old finance committee,” as this 
class of people are known, for several 
years, and has greatly reduced the 


profits of their business. 

When internal dissensions rent the 
Wesley Chapel Benevolent Association 
in twain, Mr. McClellan took the side 
of the church and laid the plan that 
bids fair to recover the property the 
seceding members carreied away, 
namely, the books and six or seven 
hundred dollars. As president of the 
board -of directors of the association, 
he has secured a charter from the 
state, which enables him to take pos¬ 
session of all of the society’s property. 

While Mr. McClellan has always ta¬ 
ken a prominent part in politics, he 
never sought a political job. He has 
served as a member of the Republican 
County Central Committee several 
times and has represented his district 
in the city and county conventions 
whenever he has felt so inclined. In 
pilitics, as in the church,he has waged 
an unrelenting warfare against those 
corrupt colored politicians whom he 
was the first to designate as “the six- 
bit push.” In 1896 the city was in¬ 
fested with this gang and they lived 
in clover during the campaigns. They 
held up every candidate for office re¬ 
gardless of party, and supported every 
ticket in the field if there was six bits 
or a glass of beer in sight Members 
of this gang frequently sat in conven¬ 


tions where there vote was knocked 
down to the highest bidder several 
times a day. Of course there was no 
difference between the buyer and the 
seller except the fact that the seller 
posed as the representative of the vir¬ 
tue and intelligence of the colored citi¬ 
zens. As editor of “The Searchlight” 
we undertook the task of ridding the 
city of these vampires. In this we had 
the valuable support of Messrs. Mc¬ 
Clellan and Flint. The Searchlight 
was turned' on the gang and it vanish- 
ished—some emigrated, others sought 
and found legitimate employment. Al¬ 
though a staunch Republican, Mr. Mc¬ 
Clellan concedes to every Negro the 
right to -vote and think as he pleases. 
It is the character and not the poli¬ 
tics of men that he values. He has 
labored for that which is good and 
stands for that which is right.

The home of Mr. and Mrs. O. E.

audience. The affirmatives were 
Messrs. Norman, Thompson and Greer. 
Negatives, Messrs. Jackson and Hen¬

judges, but the affirmatives captured 
the audience. The debate was inter¬

THE LIBERATOR. 


RENELTLES DESTINY. 


Ancient empires one by one. 

Have passed into -oblivion; 

Their prestige, spendor, wealth and 
might. 

Forever faded from our sight. 

Egypt, Greece and Rome are dead. 
Their giant ruins around are spread; 
Swept by successive tidal waves. 

To dreamless sleep in sculptural graves 

Thus will all earth’s empires fall,— 
Kings and monarchs great and small; 
Their.glory pass from land and sea, 
This is relentless destiny. 

A sea of restless discontent, 

Against despotic government. 

Will surge in foaming billows wide, 
And ebb with a resistless tide. 

A nation that will war for fame, 

No matter what its creed or name. 
Will surely fall when gored with pelf, 
History repeats itself. 

Alas! this country of the free. 

Where floats the flag of liberty— 

Is stained in deep and dark disgrace, 
By torture of a hapless race. 



My countrymen, 0, what is this— 

A terrible and deep abyss; 

From whence is heard the serpent’s 
hiss. 

Urging on to cruelties. 

Oh, scenes of bloody revelries— 

Of unparallelled, dark tragedies— 

Of flowing tears and deep-drawn sighs, 
Of broken hearts, and anguished cries! 

Vengance is mine and I will smit-p 
With ruin, death and endless night 1 
So doth the Lord of hosts decree 
This is relentless destiny. 

But there will come a judgment dire 
Upon that scourge of rope and fire 
Whether the land be bond or free ’ 
This is relentless destiny 


That ghastly sickening funeral pyr< 
lhat dreadful and consuming fire 
Columbia, hide thy face in shame! 
Behind that smoke and lurid flame. 

We shall yet see Old Glory wave, 
Triumphant o’er oppressions grave. 
Sometime we shall be great and fre< 
ihis is relentless destiny

MR. WM. WESTENFIELD. 

Mr. Westenfield of Bloomington,Cal., 
whose beautiful poems have adorned 
the poets’ corner of the Liberator, and 
which are greatly adpaired by the 
readers of this journal, is a native of 
Germany and spent his boyhood i^i a 
home beside the historic “Rhine.” 
Reared amidst the influence of free¬ 
dom and culture, filled with that no¬ 
bility that comes with a proximity to 
that which is grand in nature, known 
only to those whose youths are spent 
amidst scenes of danger, as is attend¬ 
ant on life beside a sweeping river, he 
is one of nature’s noblemen. 

He came to this country in early 
manhood and when the struggle be¬ 
tween freedom and slavery resorted to 
the arbitrament of the sword, he en¬ 
listed in an East Tennessee regiment 
and fought for the union. Like 
our other German-Amerieans, he 
made as good a soldier and as citizen. 
Mr. Westenfield was for many years a 
citizen of South Pasadena, where it 
was our good fortune to have hi pa for 
a neighbor. His home was always as 
beautiful as his religion, which was 
simply the “Golden Rule,” and which 
he practiced with scrupulous exactness. 
His latest poe.m, “Relentless Destiny,” 
will be found elsewhere in this edition 
and will be read with interest. 

---o- 

TROUBLE AT THE CAPITAL. 

The wave of lawlessness now sweep¬ 
ing over the country has been empha¬ 
sised and felt by brutal exhibitions in 


the Senate of the United States. 

When Senator Tillman of South Car¬ 
olina assaulted Senator Me Lauren of 
the same state,the country was amazed 
and the body itself astounded. Those 
who knew of the inside conditions in 
that state were prepared for anything 
which might take place. Senator Till¬ 
man’s talk about his honor was the 
subject of derision for he liad bluntly 
declared in a previous debate that his 
hands were stained with the blood of 
the dark-skinned citizens of his own 
state. 

Texas now springs into the arena 
and its junior senator, Joseph Bailey 
on last Monday, after the adjourn¬ 
ment of the Senate made a most un¬ 
justifiable attack upon Senator Bev¬ 
eridge of Indiana, claiming that he 
had grossly insulted him by charging 
him with making an unwarranted at¬ 
tack upon a govem.ment official. 

By this action,Senator Bailey proved 
the truth of Senator Beveridge’s asser¬ 
tions. 

Colored men are observing these 
performances with interest, as it is 
a practical realization of the biblical 
maxim, “as ye sow, so shall ye reap.” 

Forty years after the war of the 
Rebellion, and the enslavement of the 
Negro, we see white men occupying 
the places once held by us. 

To be plain, the assaulting of Ne¬ 
groes has led to the assaulting of 
white men; the robbery of the Ne¬ 
groes of the right to vote has led 1 to 
the robbery of white men of the right 
to vote. The denial of the protection 
of the laws to Negroes has led to the 
denial of the protection of the laws to 
white men. 

The Negroes may have been the 
bone of contention, they may have 
caused the beginning of the trouble; 
but they can now stand back with evi¬ 
dent satisfaction and see the white 
men receive the blows that they once 
received. 

They see white men charging white 
men with robbing white men at the 
ballot-boxes. They have seen and are 
still seeing the votes of the better 
class of white men nullified and the 
most disreputable white men installed 
in office. Retribution has come. It 
began in the southern states, spread 
to the north and west and may now 
be seen at the capital of the nation. 
It’s all right—God’s hand may now be 
seen in the history of the world. Evil 
agencies are made in time to do his 
will. 

Colored men, let us labor on regard¬ 
less of the oppression that surrounds 
us. We have no time to pause in our 
march forward. Corruption is every¬ 
where manifest and dishonesty is seen 
in high places, but let us keep our 
eyes on the guiding star of racial ad¬ 
vancement, trust God for the future, 
and rely upon our own efforts for the 
present and all will be well with us.—
