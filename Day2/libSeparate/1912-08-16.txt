NEGROES TO HOLD BIG CONVENTION AT 
NEW YORK CITY 


Pres. Taft, Gov. Wilson and 

(Allen’s National News Bureau, 
252 West 53rd Street) 

Rev. Simon S. P. Drew, pastor of 
the Cosmopolitan Baptist Church 
of Washington, D. C. and National 
Organizer of the Consolidated Re¬ 
publican and Independent politi¬ 
cal clubs is in the Metropolis 
making preparation for a national 
convention of the organization to 
be held here September 18th to 
20th at the Mt. Gilead Baptist 
Church in East 132nd St. 

The purpose of the meeting will 
be to get a national expression 
from the men of the race, as to 
who in the last analysis will be 
a worthy candidate to support, 
and to discuss vital matters per¬ 
taining to the political and civil 
welfare of the Negro in this country. 

Some of the subjects discussed 
will be the restoration of Compan¬ 
ies B, C and D 25th Inf. to the 
army, the urging of Negroes to 
run for Congress, and the denun¬ 
ciation of any unjust discrimina¬ 
tion of the race in this country. 
The convention will be free from 
any partisanism, but Republican 
and Democrats will meet on a 
common level, and take up the 
issues as they face the race. 

One of the subjects that will 
receive much attention from the 
convention will be the urging of 
Negroes to run for Congress, es¬ 
pecially in districts where a large 
Negro constituency reside. 

During the session Taft, Wilson 
and Roosevelt will make addresses 
and set before the country just 
where they stand on the Negro 
question. The convention will be 
one of the most notable gather¬ 
ings of Negroes ever held in this 


Col. Roosevelt to Speak. Negroe 

country, and will be epoch making 
in the political and civil welfare 
of the race in this country. 

Fully 2,000 delegates represent¬ 
ing all political faiths, and from 
every section of the Nation promise 
to be present. Some of the most 
prominent men in the political 
life in the country will be present 
and make addresses. The appear¬ 
ance of Taft, Wilson and Roose¬ 
velt before the convention will be 
one of the most interesting fea¬ 
tures of the convention. 

Prominent politicians in the Me¬ 
tropolis are looking forward to 
the convention with considerable 
interest, and will be ready to con¬ 
tribute their share to the suc¬ 
cess of the convention. Rev. 
Drew, who will be largely the 
moving spirit in the working up 
of the convention, is one of the 
best known men of the race. 

Few men wield greater influence 
in the City of Washington than 
Rev. Drew. He is personally 
known to most of the senators in 
Washington and enjoys the friend¬ 
ship of President Taft. He is a 
notable figure in the Nation’s capi¬ 
tal and figures largely as a preacher. 
His life has been one of activity 
for his race. He is the founder of 
the St. Stephen Baptist Church 
in New York and the Cosmopoli¬ 
tan Baptist Church in Washington. 
It is one of the largest churches 
in the country and has a member¬ 
ship of 2,000. 

The Mount Bethel Baptist Con¬ 
vention, one of the largest of the 
Baptist Conventions will meet in 
the Cosmopolitan Baptist Church 
from August 26th to 28th. Presi¬ 
dent Taft will address one session. 


s urged to Run for Congress. 

Dr. Drew is one of the most 
widely known men of the denomin¬ 
ation. He has established head¬ 
quarters in New York at the Hotel 
Maceo and at 210 West 18th St. 
Rev. Drew will be in and around 
New Yorkk until the time of the 
convention. 

COLORED DEMOCRACY ALL 
READY FOR WILSON 

Your correspondent made a visit 
to the headquarters of the United 
Colored Democracy at 122 W. 
136th St. last week and found 
things lively at the headquarters. 
Splendid headquarters have been 
fitted up and everything indicates 
that a lively campaign will be 
handled from the headquarters. 

Robert N. Wood, President of 
the local Democracy and the leader 
of the colored Democrats of New 
York City and State, and one of 
the most prominent men in the 
political life of the country is 
enthusiastic over the candidacy 
of Wilson. Mr. Wood, who has 
just had a conference with Gov. 
Wilson at Seagirt, said lie was 
received in the most cordial manner, 
and was assured by the Governor 
that he would stand by the Negro 
in the event of his election. Mr. 
Wood said that evry phase of the 
Negro question was discussed and 
that the Governor showed a keen 
interest in everything that was 
brought up by him. 

Mr. Wood in talking to your 
correspondent said: “It is safe in 
saying that Mr. Wilsin of elected 
will stand by the Negro. In talk¬ 
ing to him, I appealed to him from 
the standpoint of a Southerner 
who knew the situation of the 

























TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


Negro in the South. Mr. Wilson 
appeared conscious of the import¬ 
ance of recognizing the Negro 
votes and I feel that he is sincere 
in this matter.” 

THE ANNIVERSARIES OF THE 
WESTERN BAPTIST 
ASSOCIATION 


At Friendship Baptist Church 
Pasadena, August 10th to 23rd. 


This promises to be the greatest 
meeting in the history of the Asso¬ 
ciation as the great host of Bap¬ 
tists are coming from all parts 
of the State and Pasadena will be 
their Mecca. Pastor R. W. John¬ 
son, the members of Friendship 
Baptist Church and the good peo¬ 
ple of Pasadena, are planning a 
royal welcome to the delegates 
and visitors. Much interest is 
centered in the meeting as matters 
of vast importance to the denom¬ 
ination and race are to be con¬ 
sidered. The report of General 
Missionary, Dr. J. Gordon Me 
Pherson, whose incessant work 
throughout the State has made 
churchmen sit up and take notice, 
will be made Thursday morning. 
“On to Pasadena,” is the cry. 


NEGRO IS RECEIVED INTO 
JEWISH FAITH 


New York, Aug. 5.—Rufus L. 
Perry, a Negro lawyer of Brooklyn, 
has embraced and been formally re¬ 
ceived into the Jewish faith. It is 
said that Perry is the first Negro 
to accept the Jewish faith in 20 
years. 

Perry was appointed assistant 
district attorney in 1895 and in 
1911 was mentioned as a candidate 
for justice of the state supreme 
court. 


Mr, and Mrs. W. H. Lewis of 
1236 1-2 Hobart Blvd., were host 
and hostess at a dinner party 
Saturday, given in honor of Mrs. 
King and daughter, Miss Hattie, 
of Stockton, Cal. Those present 
were Madames Calvin, Brantly, 
W. H. Washington and C. A. 
King. 




Judge Paul J. McCormick 


Judge McCormick who is a can¬ 
didate for re-election to the Su¬ 
perior bench ought to succeed him¬ 
self. This we believe he will do. 
His record on the bench has been 
such that it merits the support 
of every patriotic citizen. 

On the bench he recognizes only 
the law, meeting out justice to all. 
Commenting upon the Burr Har¬ 
ris case which was tried before 
Judge McCormick last June, The 
Liberator had the following to 
say: 

“Judge McCormick, to his last¬ 
ing honor, saw to it that the cle- 
fendent had an absolute square 
deal. His rulings were fair at 
every point. Judge McCormick 
would honor any Judicial bench.” 

The selection of men for the 
Bench is one of the most im¬ 
portant duties of the voter. None 
should be so honored unless quali¬ 
fied by integrity, ability and tem¬ 
perament as well as by experience. 
This county is fortunate in having 
a man like Judge Paul J. McCor¬ 
mick on the Bench, and the people 
should use every effort to help 
keep him there. There is no 


Judge whose decisions are more 
popular or just. Occupying as he 
has for two years the criminal de¬ 
partment of the Superior Court 
of the County, he has won the ad¬ 
miration of all classes; enjoyed the 
uniform respect and confidence of 
the entire bar, and discharged his 
important duties with fairness, ac¬ 
curacy and expedition. For the 
last three months he has disposed 
of all criminal business in the Su¬ 
perior Court excepting the Darrow 
case and has thereby transacted 
the business which has heretofore 
required two department of the 
court. 


PANTAGE’S THEATRE FINED 
FOR DRAWING THE COLOR 
LINE 


The question whether a theater 
management can exclude from par¬ 
quet seats colored persons was de¬ 
termined August 5th by the Su¬ 
perior Court of Los Angeles county, 
in favor of the plaintiff in the case 
of G. O. Cochran (a colored man) 
against A. Pantages, proprietor 
of the Pantages Theater, Los An¬ 
geles. 

The facts are substantially as 
follows, to-wit: On May 20, 1911, 
Mr. Cochran, accompanied by a 
young colored lady, went to Pan¬ 
tages Theater, purchased two re¬ 
served seat tickets, and when he 
presented them at the door he was 
refused admittance to the first 
floor on the ground of cloor; 
when he complained to the ticket 
seller, the latter offered to give 
him seats upstairs or refund his 
money, both of which Mr. Cochran 
refused. Suit was filed by Cochran 
against Pantages May 16, 1912, 
for damages in the sum of $1,000.00. 
Suit was brought under certain 
Provisions of the Civil Rights 
Laws of the State of California, 
which prohibit discrimination, etc., 
in theaters and other places of 
public amusement and accommo¬ 
dation. After a stubbornly con¬ 
tested trial which lasted two days 
(July 23-24), the case was sub¬ 
mitted to the Court for further 
consideration and decision. On 
the 5th the Court gave Mr. Cochran 

























THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


judgment, and awarded him dam¬ 
ages in the sum of $50.00, and 
costs. 

Attorney Paul M. Nash of this 
city conducted the case for the 
plaintiff. 


WHITES DEGENERATING 


On the 29th of July news comes 
from Memphis, Tenn., a big South¬ 
ern city with numerous churches 
and schools that a young white 
man and a boy had burned a 
white man to death merely to 
see him run. 

Robert Ellis, a white man, an 
employe of a local ice company 
went into the park to cool off and 
fell asleep upon a bench. While 
peacefully sleeping, he was dis¬ 
covered by Mitchel Cabaniss, 
eighteen years old and Clarence 
Shaw, aged ten. Just to have a 
little fun, they procured a gallon 
of coal oil which they poured 
over the sleeping man and applied 
a lighted match. In less time 
than it takes to tell it, the unfor¬ 
tunate man was a living torch. 
The culprits have been arrested 
and may be restrained temporarily 
but for that horrible crime it will 
be impossible to punish the guilty 
parties, for the fathers and mothers 
of these boys and Southern mobs 
that made a business of lynching 
and burning Negroes alive are 
alone responsible for that crime. 
If the truth was known, a few 
months previous to the birth of 
those boys, the parents took part 
in lynching some Negro; and they 
were born with a propensity to 
commit horrible crimes just as 
the children of drunks are born 
with an insatiate thirst for strong 
drink. 

The chivalric Southern custom 
of taking their wives and daugh¬ 
ters to witness the horrible lynch- 
ings and burning Negroes at the 
stake is beginning to bear its 
legitimate fruit. “The chickens are 
coming home to roost.” For as 
sure as like begets like, women 
who witness such crimes will be 
the mothers of prenatal murder¬ 
ers. 


A WHITE GIRL BRUTALLY 
BEATEN 


Only a few weeks previous to 
this Tennessee outrage, news 
came from Georgia that a beauti¬ 
ful, poor white girl had been 
stripped and beaten so badly by a 
white mob that she had to be sent 
to a hospital. This beautiful poor 
white girl committed the crime 
of allowing the son of a wealthy 
white man to fall in love with her. 
For this crime her clothes were 
taken off and her skin beaten 
black. When it is called to mind 
that these same Georgia white 
gentlemen recently hanged a Negro 
woman without trial for killing 
a white woman in a fight, it should 
surprise no one to hear of them 
brutally beating a poor white girl 
for daring to allow a wealthy 
white man’s son to love her. 
When men’s sense of the sacredness 
of womanhood becomes so blunted 
that they respect only women of 
a certain complexion, they will 
finally reach the point where their 
respect for a woman will depend 
upon the amount of force that 
is behind her. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


Mr. Morgan T. White who at¬ 
tended the National Grand Lodge 
sessions of the U. B. of F., which 
were recently held in Chicago, 
has returned. He reports an im¬ 
portant meeting of the Order.

systems at Porterville. He is an 


employe of the Cement Pipe and 
Construction Company of River¬ 
side. Mr. Downing says that 
there are many openings in 
and near the small towns for 
industrious colored families, and 
says that colored people who fail 
to get out into the country and 
buy homes are making a serious 
mistake. 


Mr. J. G. Lindsey left for Oak¬ 
land, Saturday. He goes to assist 
in the organization of a K. of P. 
lodge in the Bay City.

STAYING AWAY FROM THE 
POLLS WILL NOT CURE PO¬ 
LITICAL ILLS. 


Owing to the attitude of both 
Taft and Roosevelt respecting the 
Negroes' civil and political rights 
and the treatment he is receiving 
locally, there is much talk among 
the Negroes of staying home and 
letting the coming elections go 
by default. This is wrong, as 
there are many questions affecting 
the Negroes' rights, both National 
and local that present a very 
strong argument in favor of them 
going to the polls and taking a 
hand. It is true that there seems 


to be a studied attempt to avoid 
any recognition of the Negroes' 
political strength so as to deny 
him the recognition to which he 
is entitled. But the colored voters 
owe it to themselves to silently 
concentrate their forces, moral and 
otherwise, wherever necessary to 
defeat any office holder who has 
shown himself unfriendly to them 
and their rights—Pridham for in¬ 
stance. 


THAT NURSE TRAINING 
OUTRAGE 


The absurd claim made by 
Pridham and his immediate as¬ 
sociates that the admission of 
inteligent Negro girls to the nurse 
training school at the County 
hospital would cause white girl 
nurses to desert the sick and dying, 
puts them, the white girls, in a 
brutal position. 

When it is known that the lady 
nurses at the County hospital 
attend to the wants of the sick 
inmates, no matter what they are, 
and that these unfortunates are 
made up of white people, Negroes, 
Mexicans, Hindoos, Chinamen and 
all other members of the human 
family, to claim that they, the 
nurses, would resign and leave 
those unfortunates to suffer, be¬ 
fore they would perform the same 
duties by the side of healthy, in¬ 
telligent, upright Negro girls, is 
so ridiculous that words cannot 
describe the disgust it arouses in the 
minds of the average intelligent 
person. This claim made by Mr. 
Pridham and his associates, the 
Lissner crowd, is just as disgusting 
to fair-minded white people as 
it is to colored people. There are 
thousands of white people who are 
growing tired of being held up to 
the ridicule of the world just to 
enable a few scheming politicians 
to dodge their sworn duties. 

If every Negro man and woman 
do their duty, the fair-minded 
white people of the 5th Super¬ 
visorial District will help to defeat 
Pridham. This will be done . 


SUPERVISORS NELLIS AND 
McCABE 


No two candidates for reelection 
deserves more at the hands of 
the voters than do Nellis and 
McCabe. These gentlemen are 
making the race for reelection on 
their records as public servants, 
and we are certain that they will 
receive the endorsement of the 
voters at the primaries. With the 
defeat of Pridham in the 5th dis¬ 
trict, which is certain and the re- 
election of McCabe in the 2nd 
district and Nellis in the 4th dis¬ 
trict, which is also sure to come to 
pass, the rights of every citizen 
without regard to race, color or 
condition will be protected in all 
matters over which they have 
control. 

After carefully considering this 
whole matter, we have reached the 
conclusion that the interest of 
the Negro voters will be best 
served by the reelection of Nellis 
in the 4th district and McCabe 
in the 2nd. We therefore urge 
every voter, male and female in 
the 2nd and 4th districts, to vote 
for McCabe and Nellis respective¬ 
ly. If this is done, the door of 
hope will stand open for every 
citizen. The fact that these gen¬ 
tlemen in all matters of public 
policy have stood for, and advo¬ 
cated a square deal for all, is 
one of the best reasons for their 
reelection. 

Vote for them and ask your 
neighbor to do the same.
