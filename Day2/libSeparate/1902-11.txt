MILTON K. YOUNG 

Candidate for Superior Court 


Milton K. Young, nominated by the 
democratic county convention for 
judge of the superior court, is now in 
his 35th year. He was born in Litch¬ 
field, Ill. When he was four years of 
age his parents located in Sedalia, Mo., 
and there his boyhood and school days 
were passed. He received his educa¬ 
tion in the educational institutions of 
Missouri. In 1886 he chose California 
as his home, locating in Los Angeles. 
Later he took up the study of law in 
San Francisc and was admitted to the 
bar of the supreme court in 1892. He 
thereupon returned to Los Angeles and 
engaged in the practice, where he has 
since followed his profession. 


If industry and perseverence are rec¬ 
ommendations for popular favor, then 
Mr. Young is entitled to receive it in 
full measure; these qualities have built 
for him a large practice and are es¬ 
sential in a judge. 

Knowledge of the mining law, as well 
as familiarity with practical mining, 
which is of great advantage to the 
practitioner in the perparation and 
trial of such cases, has caused his 
employment in important cases in 
other states. Being careful as a law¬ 
yer in the preparation of his cases, 
as a judge he is not likely to pass 
over with hasty conclusion the points 
that members of the bar have spent 


much time and care in preparation. 

Mr. Young is of the age at which 
many of the leading jurists have been 
elevated to the bench. It is agreed 
that no quality is more desirable In 
the judge than a receptive mind, and 
experience shows that it is more like¬ 
ly to be found in the mature young 
man than in him who has reached the 
age where opinions have grown more 
pronounced. 

At the recent democratic county 
convention held in Los Angeles, he 
was chosen chairman and at that 
time was requested to become a can¬ 
didate for superior judge, receiving 
the nomination by acclamation. 

Mr. Young has conducted many im¬ 
portant cases in the state courts and 
United States circuit courts and United 
States circuit court of appeals. 

Mr. Young is the present exalted 
ruler of the Los Angeles lodge of the 
Benevolent and Protective Order of 
Elks. His friends, regardless of 
party affiliations, are rallying to his 
support, urging that the judiciary 
should be non-partisan, and that party 
majority should be no bar to election 
in the case of Milton K. Young, as the 
vote should be cast, not on party lines, 
but for the man.

ELIZABETH CADY STANTON GONE 
FROM EARTH 

Susan B. Anthony Deeply Moved. 

New York, Oct. 26.—Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton, the well-known woman suf¬ 
fragist, died today at her 'home in 
West Ninety-fourth street in this city. 
Old age was given as the cause of 
death. She was conscious almost to 
the last. Amout a week ago Mrs. 
Stanton began to fail rapidly. This 
became more noticeable last week, 
and it was known to the family that 
her death was only a question of days 
or hours. 

The children of Mrs. Stanton are 
Mrs. M. F. Lawrence and Mrs. Stanton 
Blatch of New York, Henry and Rob¬ 
ert L. Stanton of New York, lawyers; 
Theodore Stanton of Paris, and G. 
Smith Stanton, a real estate broker 
at Warden Cliffe, Long Island. The 
funeral will be held Wednesday, but 
the hour has not been set. The inter¬ 
ment will be in Woodlawn cemetery. 

MISS ANTHONY’ TRIBUTE. 

Rochester, N. Y., Oct. 26.—The news 
of the death of Elizabeth -Cady Stan¬ 
ton fell with crushing weight upon 
Susan B. Anthony, who had planned 
to go to New York, November 12, to 
assist the venerable advocate of wo¬ 
man’s suffrage in the celebration of 
her eighty-seventh birthday. Miss 
Anthony said tonight: 

“Through the early days when the 
world was against us, we stood to¬ 
gether. Mrs. Stanton was always a 
courageous woman, a leader of 
thought and new movement. She 
was a most finished writer, and every 
state paper presented -to Congress or 
the state legislatures in the early days 
was written by Mrs. Stanton. I can¬ 
not express myself at all, as I feel too 
crushed to say much, but if she had 
outlived me, she would have found 
fine words with which to express our 
friendship.” 

“What period of your lives gave you 
the greatest pleasure?” was asked. 

“When we were digging together. 
When we forged the thunderbolts, and 
I fired them. The greatest campaign 
we ever had together was in ’69, at 
the constitutional convention, held in 
Kansas, for suffrage and the same 
year in New Y'ork state. 

“In spite of her big family, to whom 


she was devoted, and the great amount 
of work she did outside of her home, 
she was one of the finest housekeep¬ 
ers I ever saw. 

“The last time I saw Mrs. Stanton 
was in June. She talked about the 
other side,” said Miss Anthony, “but 
had no faith that there was any other 
world. She always said that this was 
a beautiful world, and she wanted to 
stay here as long as possible. She be¬ 
lieved in the immutable law in every¬ 
thing, and did not believe in any spe¬ 
cial Providence for herself or any one 
else.” 

Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton had 
campaigned together all over this 
country. They went to England to¬ 
gether in 1883. 

“She went to call an international 
suffrage convention,” said Miss An¬ 
thony, “taut the English people were 
afraid of it then. But it was at that 
time she conceived the idea of the con¬ 
vention which five years later was 
held in Washington, and later formed 
into the International Council of Wo¬ 
men. We received many attentions 
on this visit to England, being re¬ 
ceived by John Bright and other dis¬ 
tinguished persons.” 


A RACIAL OBJECT LESSON. 

These are the facts. I present no ar¬ 
gument. If facts are not potent as ar¬ 
guments, they are not significant facts 
—or the reader is not intelligent. 
There now. . 

On a branch motor line of the South¬ 
ern Pacific a day or two ago, I saw two 
stylishly dressed little girls. One was 
about fourteen years old and so was 
the other. Each had on a pink shirt 
waist and each carried a dog eared 
novel and a pretty face ; They were 
self-conscious and knew they were at¬ 
tractive. The only person who didn’t 
seem to admire them was the sober¬ 
faced chap who looked at them as 
if he had girls of his own that he was 
determined should never do likewise. 
They were talking loudly. It was plain 
to be seen that something or some¬ 
body had had on them an influneee 
that had robbed them of the sweet 
childish simplicity that should have 
characterized them at their age. What 
it was I could not tell at first. Then 
one of them remarked; 


“Let’s get up and go back where we 
can read.” 

They did so. When they came with¬ 
in the brighter rays of the Pintsch 
lights they began to chew gum and 
read. One of them interrputed the 
other to ask: 

“What is the name of you book?” 

“ ‘The Fugitive Bride.’ What’s 
yours?” 

“ ‘On her Wedding Morn.’ ” 

And into that trash they plunged, 
after casting in each direction glances 
of affected shyness. 

There was no longer any wonder 
as to what was the matter with the 
girls. The literature with which they 
had been allowed to become infatuated 
told the whole story. 

Near them sat a little negro girl, 
facing her mother, who had turned a 
seat so that she and her daughter 
might he companionable. The negro 
girl looked to be identically the same 
age as the white girls. Yet she was 
quiet and discreet, infinitely better in 
her deportment than her fairer sisters. 
She sat with her form erect, clad in 
snowy white, a model of decorum. If 
she noted the chatter and indiscretion 
of the two human magpies, who should 
have been at home with their mothers, 
she gave no evidence of it—she was 
too well-bred. 

And still some people say there is a 
race question in this coutnrty!—Gilli- 
lanu, in the Herald. 


BOOKER WASHINGTON COMING. 
Noted Colored Educator and Orator 
Will be in Los Angeles the Last of 
December. 

Prof. A. E. Shumote, president of 
the California State Teachers’ Asso¬ 
ciation, who spoke yesterday before 
the local teachers at the high school, 
dwelt enthusiastically upon the sub- 
pect of the coming meeting of the 
state associations, to he held here De¬ 
cember 29, and stated that the famous 
colored educator, Booker T. Washing¬ 
ton, has been secured for two ad¬ 
dresses at that time. Prof. Hopkins 
of Kansas is also expected. 

Correspondence is being carried on 
with other educators in the hope that 
their services may also be secured, 
and efforts are being made to render 
the meeting a notable one. Mrs. 
Eugene Pettigrew, president of the 
Consumers’ League, also spoke.—

THE COLORED PRESS MUZZLED. 

The shameless manner in which 
the Republicans have muzzled the col¬ 
ored press is a disgrace. Their man¬ 
agers have been given to understand 
that editorial support is not to he 
given to such staunch friends of the 
negroes as Le Compte Davis. The 
negro press has been ordered to sup¬ 
port the notorious negro-hating C. W. 
Pendleton for Senator, in spite of the 
fact that he always refers to negro 
men as coons and negro women as 
coonesses. The editor of the Eagle 
says Pendleton called him a coon to 
his face, but he has been ordered to 
fall in and support him, or say noth¬ 
ing against him. He has been forbid¬ 
den to say anything for Mr. Davis, 
who has always treated the negro as a 
man. 


MUST SUPPORT WHITE—The 
negro press has been rolled over a 
barrel and ordered to support White 
for Sheriff, or say nothing against 
him. This is in the face of the fact 
that White is everywhere freely 
charged with saying that he did not 
need the vote of the negroes and Mex¬ 
icans, and if he is elected no negro 
will ever be seen around the court 
house as a officer. He has not conde¬ 
scended to deny these charges. He 
does not speak to a negro. But the 
Republicans nominated him, and the 
negroes have simply got to support 
him. The Republican central commit¬ 
tee will issue a circular in a few days 
denying the charges, as White has re¬ 
fused to do so. If the negro papers 
cannot denounce the enemies of the 
race and support those who aid the 
negro in his struggles, who extend to 
him a helping hand in time of need, 
what good can the negro papers do 
the negro? 


WHO IS LE COMPTE DAVIS?—He 
is one of the most eminent lawyers 
at the bar, he is a young man, of 
whom all are justly proud. For 
friendly services rendered to the col¬ 
ored citizens he is known and loved 
by every colored man and woman in 
this city. Mr, Davis is known and 
loved by the negroes for what he has 
done for them. Mr. Pendleton is 


known only for what he has said 
against them. Whenever Mr. Davis 
believed in the innocence of those of 
our unfortunate people who have been 
hauled into the courts, he defended 
them, whether they had money or not. 
This he has often done, in the face of 
a strong adverse public sentiment. 

Though The Enterprise and The 
Eagle may be silenced in their defense 
of the race, the colored voters can¬ 
not he made to s-wallow Pendleton and 
White when they go into the booth. 
The negroes are intelligent; they are 
thinking; THEY KNOW WHAT TO 
DO AND HOW TO DO IT. 


THE LANE RALLY—As was to be 
expected, the Lane rally given under 
the auspices of the Colored Men’s 
Club, was small. But compared with 
other political rallies in this, the most 
apathetic campaign in the history of 
the state, it was a good meeting. The 
meeting was remarkable for the en¬ 
thusiasm and intelligence of those 
composing it. One other very re¬ 
markable feature about the meeting 
was the presence of a number of in¬ 
telligent colored ladies. The presence 
and enthusiasm of the ladies show 
that a revolution is taking place in the 
sentiment of the negroes on public 
questions, and it will not be long, be- 
before it will make itself felt. When 
we take into consideration the pres¬ 
sure that had been brought to hear 
and the money spent to break up the 
Lane rally, and the manner in which 
the Lane supporters have been handi¬ 
capped, the wonder is that there was 
any meeting at all. It is an easy mat¬ 
ter to take the popular side and shout 
with the throng and the multitude, 
but to stand with the few for the right, 
requires a hero. It is an easy matter 
to float down stream—a log can float 
down stream by the side of a magnifi¬ 
cent steamer, but only the plucky craft 
can float against the tide. So it is 
with men. So it is with the few stal¬ 
wart negroes who are daring to stand 
alone and fight the battle for represen¬ 
tation for the colored voters and tax¬ 
payers. We will fight on without 
faltering, we will labor and wait. 


COLORED DEMOCRATS MEET 
Pour Out Campaign Eloquence to a 
Small Audience. 

In one respect the meeting last 
night in Elks’ Hall of the Colored 
Men’s Lane Club was remarkable, said 
J. L. Edmunds, editor of the Liberator, 
who was a leader of the meeting. It 
was the first political gathering here 
of colored people that was attended by 
women of that race. The attendance 
at the meeting was small, but that 
did not put a damper on the speakers, 
whose orations were in eloquence such 
as might be heard during the debate 
in congress of some great measure, 
but seldom are heard in political cam¬ 
paign gatherings. Rev. C. W. H. Nelson 
presided. He introduced first Mr. 
Edmunds, who said that there was a 
time not very long ago, when he could 
not vote anything but a Republican 
ticket. He regretted that such had 
been the case, for it was a reflection 
on his mental strength, that at the 
time he was unable to think correctly 
and was not then fit to exercise the 
rights of American citizenship. He 
quoted Booker T. Washington in sup¬ 
port of his plea for independence and 
non-partisanship . “We 'want to select 
the best men about us, and let parti¬ 
sanship go.” 

Before the speaking and between 
times a colored quartet sang southern 
lullabys and campaign songs. R. F. 
Dauglas of Marysville said that he 
had come all the way to Los Angeles 
to invite the people of this county to 
be present in January at Sacramento, 
when Franklin K. Lane will be inau¬ 
gurated governor of California. He 
occupied but a few minutes in making 
an address, but it was of surprising 
force and eloquence. 

The humorous speaker was Charles 
Swaine, who, like the others, told that 
he had left the Republican party to 
become a Democrat, and he told why. 
His conversion came about at Pueblo, 
Col. Speaking of it, Mr. Swaine fell 
into the negro dialect. 

“Does yo’ knew what the Republe- 
kins does to the nigger? Whuff! Like 
the win’, when the is true with his 
voting, da’s true with the nigger. Do 
yo’ know, we’s as free as Mr. White 
Man? Da’ knew dat now in Pee-blo, 
where we dun xtepublekins and voted 
fur Democrets. Did da forget us? No! 
Da put colored men on the police force 
and colored men drivin’ de patrol 
wagon. Colored men all over, walking 
about as big as Mr. White Man heself. 
Dat’s what we can do heyar, and dat’s 
whar Ah ’spects to shine. Yes, sir; 
we can do it.” 

Mr. Swaine’s speech was not all in 
this vein, but was devoted in part to 
telling in pleasant speech why, as a 
colored man, he is a Democrat, hav- 
found, he said, that the Democrats 
treated his race with as much if not 
more consideration than did the Re¬ 
publicans.—Herald.

PAUSE BEFORE YOU VOTE.—Ev¬ 
ery colored voter should pause before 
casting his ballot long enough to ask 
himself what he hopes to accomplish 
by voting. The average white man, 
before depositing his ballot, satisfies 
himself that the success of the candi¬ 
dates for which he decides to vote will 
increase his and his children’s oppor¬ 
tunity of getting on in the world. Un¬ 
fortunately for the colored voter, he 
gives these important matters little 
or no consideration whatever. He 
goes in for the success of the white 
Republican office-seeker, with no 
thought of what he or his children 
or his race is to gain. This course 
has been too often pursued by the col¬ 
ored voters of this city and county. 
What is the result? 

The result is the natural conse¬ 
quence of such thoughtlessness. Men 
who do not think accomplish nothing. 
Men who are swayed by their preju¬ 
dices in electing men to office cannot 
command the respect of men who are 


swayed by reason. The negro has 
voted the Republican ticket here for 
years, and of the hundred or more 
clerks employed during the year in 
the count house and city hall, there 
is not a single colored clerk employed. 
Every job in the city the negro holds, 
above cleaning spittoons, they got 
them from the Democrats. Randolph, 
the only colored policeman. Bright and 
Glenn in the fire department, and 
Johnson, messenger at the city hall, 
were all appointed by the Democrats, 
'ihere are several colored men in the 
street department, appointed by the 
Democrats. When, a few days since, 
Capt. Beaty, an honorably discharged 
federal soldier, was nominated for po¬ 
liceman, every Republican on the 
board voted against him, and he was 
defeated, though he is a staunch Re¬ 
publican. What has the Republican 
party in the city and county done to 
elevate the negro, and the boys and 
girls he is educating? What consider¬ 
ation do the Republicans give the 
negro voters for keeping them in of¬ 
fice? In the public service they have 
drawn the color line to the point of ex¬ 
clusion. They draw the line at the 
spittoon and say: “Thus far shalt thou 
go, and no farther.” As a- result, the 
color line is being drawn in hotels and 
restaurants, theatres and bath houses 
with impunity. 

Every colored voter who wants this 
state of affairs to continue should vote 
the Republican ticket from top to 
bottom. If you want your sons and 
daughters shut out of the public ser¬ 
vice, vote as a unit for the Repub¬ 
lican ticket. If you want the black 
laws to remain on the statute books 
of this state, continue to vote as a 
unit for the Republican ticket. If you 
want your newspapers to be forced to 
support those who speak of you as 
coons, vote the whole Republican tick¬ 
et. While the negro is voting as a 
unit for the Republican party, his 
rights are melting away, like waj r - 
ward snowflakes that stray from their 
lofty mountain homes into our rose 
covered valleys. Brethren, pause be¬ 
fore you vote. What we have said 
in this connection is not because we 
love the Republican party less, but 
love the negro more. 


READ BEFORE YOU VOTE. 
Judge Winder, candidate for supe¬ 
rior judge is a gentleman in every 
way worthy of the suffrage of the 
voters of this county and city. While 
he is dignified and fair in his treat¬ 
ment of all with whom he comes in 
contact, the colored citizens have no 
warmer friend in the State. 

% * * 

What is true of Judge Winder is 
equally true of Hon. H. T. Gordon, also 
a candidate for superior judge. Should 
they be elected, the voters will never 
have reason to regret their actions. 

* * * * 

Le Compete Davis. No colored 
voter will leave the booth until his 
ballot read thus: 

For Senator 38th Senatorial District: 

Le Compte Davis |X| 

When you have done this, your 
wives and daughters will say, well 
done. Cut this out. 

:Ji * * * 

For Sheriff of Los Angeles County: 

John T. Wilson |X| 

This is the way every self-respect¬ 
ing colored man’s ballot will read 
when he votes for -Sheriff. Mr. Wil¬ 
son will be Sheriff of the negroes and 
Mexicans as well as the other citizens. 
* * * * 

For Tax Assessor: 

Capt Jacob C. Newton |X| 

You will make no mistake by vot¬ 
ing for Capt Newton. He is a farmer, 
and a working man, like the rest of 
us. 

* * * * 

The colored men never had a bet¬ 
ter friend that Mr. James Hanley, can¬ 
didate for the State Board of Equeliza- 
tion. Every colored man that knows 
him says he ought to poll the full 
colored vote. He will be elected, but 
you must give him your vote. 

* * * * 

For City Justice of the Peace: 

Charles O. Morgan |X| 

Judge Morgan has made an able, 

conscientious officer. He forced the 
milkmen -to give the city pure milk. 
This of itself entitles^ him to re-elec¬ 
tion. He has dealt out justice even- 
handed. He gave the colored people 
the first jury composed entirely of 
colored men, to prevent the possibility 
of prejudice miscarrying justice. 


A vote for Justice Austin will be a 
vote cast for the right man. He is a 
worthy officer and should be re-elect¬ 
ed. Vote for him.

Republican County Central 
Committee think White 
will be Defeated. Ex¬ 
tracts from a Circular 
sent to Voters. White a 
gone Gosling. 

IMPORTANT! 

Dear Sir: 

Your attention is called to the fact 
that a very bitter fight is being made 
against W. A. White, our candidate 
for -Sheriff, and unless special effort 
is made at once to check it, his defeat 
may result. 

Stories are being circulated more 
or less on the quiet, to the effect that 
members of this committee and W. A. 
Hammell, our Sheriff, are working 
against him; that he went to the State 
convention and worked against Mr. 
Gage; that he has said that he 
“wouldn’t have a ‘nigger,’ ‘greaser,' 
old soldier or ‘damned Gage man’ in 
his office.” 

Mr. White has made no public de¬ 
nial of these grave charges in his 
canvass or otherwise to the voters in¬ 
sulted. 

During his two terms of office as 
city tax collector he has given em¬ 
ployment to the colored and the Span¬ 
ish people, to the old soldier and to 
Mr. Gage's supporters. 

The truth of the matter is, that 
when Mr. White assumed the duties 
of City Tax Collector the colored per¬ 
sons employed in that office were soon 
dropped. This is the whole truth. If 
White is elected there will be no ne¬ 
groes at the court house. 


HON. EDWARD L. HUTCHISON. 
The election of Mr. Hutchison, which 
seems certain, will be a case of the 
best man winning. It is the superior 
fitness of Mr. Hutchison that appeals 
to the voters of his district, and not 
his geographical location. One is 
business and the other is sickly sen¬ 
timent. Which shall triumph in this 
contest the intelligent voters must de¬ 
cide. This is simply ,a business prop¬ 
osition, and the candidate best quali¬ 
fied to> transact business for this state 
and district in the senate should he 
elected). By common -consent that 
man is the Hon. Edward L. Hutchison. 
Every intelligent colored voter in the 


district who knows one or both of 
them will vote for Mr. Hutc-hison. 
As a solution of the color question he 
says: “All good people should be 

•treated alike. The line should be 
drawn between the good and the bad.” 
A man who stands on a broad platform 
like the one quoted above, is not only 
entitled to every colored vote in his 
district, hut to every intelligent white 
vote as well. If the negro wants a 
fair chance he must lose no opportu¬ 
nity to vote for men who are willing 
to give it to him. Brethren, when 
you go into the booth, vote for your 
friend. 


OUR DUTY. 

In advocating a division of the negro 
vote, we are urging the negro to do 
what we believe is best for the ne¬ 
gro. We are simply looking for the 
negro’s interest. The fact that we are 
on the unpopular side of this contest 
gives us no concern whatever, since 
we know that we are on the right side. 
When Lincoln, a Whig, filed a protest 
against the pro-slavery resolutions tha r 
were passed by the Whig legislature 
of Illinois in 1836, it received the en¬ 
dorsement of but two men. Lincoln 
was one. He took the unpopular side 
because it was the right side. “Slav¬ 
ery,” he said in his protest, “is found¬ 
ed on both injustice and bad policy.” 
For this he was denounced, both north 
and south, as mischievous and dan¬ 
gerous. Lincoln was right, but his 
cause was unpopular. We believe a 
solid negro vote is detrimental to the 
negro and dangerous to his commun¬ 
ity. The solid negro vote and the 
solid South have conspired together 
to nullify the constitution and make 
the negro the victim of race prejudice 
from one end of the country to the 
other. As long as the negro votes 
solidly for the Republican party he 
demonstrates his unfitness for Ameri¬ 
can citizenship, and the party dare not 
attempt to elevate him above white 
men who think, even if it was disposed 
to do so. Men who think will not 
be governed by men who do not think. 
What has been done in the South to 
get rid of the solid negro vote would 
be done in the North under similar 
circumstances. If the negro, in order 


to secure his rights, must vote solidly 
for the Republican party, why is it 
that after voting solidly for the party 
thirty-five years -he has less rights 
now than he had when he commenced 
voting? Why is it that Germans, Irish, 
Jews and Mexicans divide their vote? 
Lincoln, Garrison, Phillips, John 
Brown and Lovejoy had the courage 
of their convictions; they took the un¬ 
popular side—it was" the right side. If 
the negro is ever to enjoy his full 
political rights in this country, he will 
have to act as other American citizens 
—think and act accordingly.

mouth, Ill., and then came to Los An¬ 
geles, Cal. He is a member of the well 
known firm of Adcock & Reymert, with 
offices in the Bullard building in this 
city, an old firm well established in the 
confidence of the people of Southern 
California. 

Mr. Adcock belongs to the Bar Asso¬ 
ciation of this county, and of the State 
Bar Association, and is admitted to 
practice in all the state and federal 
courts. He has been attorney in some 
of the most important cases in the 
county and was especially brought into 
prominence by his able defense, in the 
United States courts, of the strikers 
in 1893. 

During his practice at the bar Mr. 
Adcock has met with success and is 
rated as one of our substantial and 
public spirited citizens. 

Mr. Adcock is a Democrat in politics, 
and as such was nominated by his party 
for district attorney by acclamation. We 
do not for this reason alone ask you to 
aid in electing him to this office; but 
we solicit your support rather on ac¬ 
count of his recognized ability, fitness 
and well known integrity, confidently 
believing it will be for the best interest 
of the county that he should be elected. 

We ask yon to compare Mr. Adcock in 
respect to experience and ability with 
all others who seek this office, and use 
the same judgment that you would in 
your private business if you were to se¬ 
lect an attorney to represent you.

THE LIBERATOR. 


THE LIBERATOR AND THE TIMES 
NOT MUZZLED. 

When the Republican muzzle man¬ 
agers went around muzzliing the 
papers that refused to support 
“Corny” Pendleton, they gave the of¬ 
fices of The Liberator and Times a 
wide berth. They recognized the steel 
out of which these two great cham¬ 
pions are made, and dared not risk 
the chances of a combat. The Libera¬ 
tor will support the friends of the 
negro and fight his enemies, wherever 
found. The Democrat who respects 
and treats the negro fairly is as good 
as the Republican who respects and 
treats the negro fairly. The negro- 
hating Democrat is no better than the 
negro-hating Republican. This journal 
will not support White or Pendleton; 
first, because the gentlemen running 
against them are best fitted for the 
places to which they aspire, and sec¬ 
ondly, because both Pendleton and 
White are avowed enemies of the 
negroes. We will fight them until the 
last vote is polled. Their defeat, 
which is almost certain, will not only 
be a public blessing, but a triumph of 
the intelligent negro vote. The col¬ 
ored voters have now the opportunity 
to win a great victory, and they will 
win it. In this fight for representation 
and the right of the negroes to vote 
for their choice as American citizens, 
you have in the Liberator a fearless 
champion that the bosses cannot whip 
into line to support your enemies and 
traducers. We have enlisted in this 
war to fight for right and justice, and 
we never surrender to wrong because 
it is popular. 


THAT RALLY. 

MR. JAMES MILLER who had 
charge of the Republican rally, colo>~ 
ede, took time by the forelock when 
he rented Brent’s hall in which to hold 
the well-advertised rally. It is the 
smallest hall in town. Here was a 
display of wisdom. If Elks’ hall had 
been used that audience would have 
looked like a sweet potato patch after 
a white frost Mr. Miller, in introduc¬ 
ing the candidates, referred to them as 
“this and that fellow.” Mr. Mr. Keppel, 
candidate for superintendent of edu¬ 
cation, as “the fellow like me, who 
has just quit a janitor’s job.” Miller’s 


introductions made the candidates 
look like cucumbers that had been too 
close to the fire. Capt. Hawkins, the 
C. W. B., was there in all his glory, 
and his yells would have made one un¬ 
acquainted with the situation believe 
that the infernal regions had been 
uncapped. In fact, the Captain was 
the main attraction of the evening. 
It was a carnival of noise and avoir- 
dupoise. The speaking was the stale 
rehash so so often dished out by col¬ 
ored Republicans. The only speech 
that showed progress was delivered 
by Editor Neimore of The Eagle. He 
urged the voters to scrutinize their 
ticket well before voting, and then 
vote for the best man. He called 
special attention to the fact that 
parties very often make bad nomina- 
er ower a duty to his country far great 
greater than that to his party.” In 
other words, he should vote against bad 
nominees. Messrs. Easton and Prince 
delivered speeches of the old order, 
urging the colored voters to vote the 
whole ticket, regardless of the fitness 
of the nominees. This kind of voting 
by the negro has led to his disfran¬ 
chisement, and rightfully, too. Mr. 
Pearson’s speech was ancient and fos- 
siliferous and required considerable ef¬ 
fort on his part to get rid of it. By 
actual measurement he walked ten 
miles in its delivery, and sweated 
like an ethopian in a corn field. He 
dealt only in things of the past. He 
turned the backs of his hearers to the 
roseate morning and fed them on rel¬ 
ics gathered from the cemetery of 
dead issuse. 

“Corny” Pendleton made his ap¬ 
pearance in the hall late, and was 
coldly received. A few paid shouters 
tried to raise a noise, but the atmos¬ 
phere was too chilly. He crept into 
the hall, and through the open door 
looked sadly on the scene and disap¬ 
peared. 

The song. The Star Spangled Ban¬ 
ner, by Mrs. Julia B. Roan, was the 
crowning feature of the evening. It 
fell on the audience like an inspira¬ 
tion. McVea’s orchestra and the 
Glen wood glee club acquitted them¬ 
selves nicelj'. 


Mr. W. E. Easton is not only a fine 
writer but an orator as well. His short 
speech at Brents’ hall showed that he 
had to swallow “Cony” Pendleton, that 
naturally handicaped him and forced 
him to deal entirely with the past. To 
get the negro’s vote for the Repub¬ 
lican party one must appeal his preju¬ 
dice. 


THE A. M. E. Z. CONFERENCE. 

Bishop Clinton is holding the thirty- 
fifth annual conference of the A. M. E. 
Z. Church of California and Oregon at 
Fourth and Ruth streets. 

Bishop Clinton resides at Charlotte' 
N. C., and his episcopacy extends from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast, the 
conferences of Philadelphia and Balti¬ 
more, Kentucky, western Tennessee, 
Mississippi, northern Arkansas an 
California and Oregon being under his 
jurisdiction. 

Twenty-two ministers and ten lay 
delegates were present yesterday and 
more are expected to arrive before the 
conference is concluded. Some of the 
visiting colored ministers are among 
the ablest and 1 most eloquent men of 
the church. „ 

The conference was opened at 12:15 
o’clock. After devotional exercises of¬ 
ficers were elected as follows: Secre¬ 
tary, Rev. W. W. Howard; assistant 
secretary, Rev. J. W. Wright; reporter 
to city press, Rev. S. W. Hawkins; re¬ 
porter to Star of -Zion, the official or¬ 
gan of the church, published at Char- 
lotts, N. C., Dr. T. Brown; timeist, Rev. 
J. C. Roberts; marshall Rev. T. A. Mc- 
Eachen; statistician. Miss J. Ward; 
secretary to the bishop, Miss O. Mit- 
chen. 


Every colored voter who wants to 
take part in the inauguration of Gov. 
Lane next January should fall in and 
vote for him next Tuesday. He is a 
winner, boys. Vote as American cit¬ 
izens—not as political serfs. 


Rev. Smith of San Francisco, an 
eminent minister and prominent poli¬ 
tician, is attending the A. M. E. Z. con¬ 
ference which is now in session here. 
Rev. Smith is strong a Pardee man; 
he thinks, however, the negroes ought 
to form an independent party. 


PRINCE AND MILLER TO GO HOME 

If Mr. Hahn is elected, Chas. Prince 
will be called home and his place is to 
be given to Mr. Joe Bunch. The jan¬ 
itor jobs held- by Mr. Bunch will be 
farmed out to his lieutenant in his 
fight for Mr. Hahn. Jackson will be 
“chief cook and bottle washer” of the 
court house janitorships. Mr. Miller 
will be called home to resume his 
fight for the janitorship of the Pasa¬ 
dena city hall. Mr. Carr, the orator, 
is to be a “has-been”. “Every dog has 
his day.” Poor Carr! they forced him 
to speak for “Mtars” Hahn last Mon¬ 
day night. Carr has had his day; now 
for Jack.
