A Virginia Judge Lynched on the Bench 

THE SHERIFF, DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND A WHITE 


THE HALLS OF JUSTICE A 
SLAUGHTER HOUSE 


SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE 
JURY SHOT DOWN. THE 
MOB WAS ORDERLY. 


The killing of the judge on the 
bench and the sheriff, district at- 
tornay, a young white woman 
and the maiming of several 
members of the jury in the 
court house at Hillsville, Vir¬ 
ginia, last week is the legitimate 
result of the continued inhuman 
cold-blooded butchering and burn¬ 
ing-alive of defenseless Negro men. 
and women in this country by 
mobs. 

White men are beginning to 
reap what they have been so dili¬ 
gently sowing. Negroes by the 
hundreds have been lynched for 
being Negroes. Here a whole 
court .in this so called Christian 
country, was lynched for the crime 
of finding white criminals guilty 
of crime. 

By killing a white woman the 
mob showed the same disregard 
for her life, that they show for the 
lives of Negro women. The As¬ 
sociated Press, which has made 
mobs popular, by making their 
bloody crimes deeds of heroism 
calls the members of that mob 
bandits and their lynching “as¬ 
sassination,” because the mob’s 
victims are white men and women. 
No class has done more to make 
that Virginia " lynching possible, 
than the officers of the law, them¬ 
selves. In the immunity offered 
white murderers from punishment, 
when Negroes are victims, has 
made a farce of the courts of 


WOMAN WERE ALSO LYNCHE1 

justice and brought the law into 
general contempt. 

A few weeks ago a mob in Tennes¬ 
see went into the sheriff’s office and 
in his presence, finished slaughter¬ 
ing a number of Negroes that it 
had attacked in the street. The 
Negroes charged with murder 
were unarmed and in the 
custody of the law. In Georgia, 
a Negro convicted of murder, 
standing up before the Judge, 
who was pronouncing the sentence 
of death upon him, was shot down 
by a member of a mob. The shot 
failing to kill the prisoner, he 
left a trail of blood from the bench 
on which sat the unjust 
Judge, to the gallows, which were 
in readiness. The man who at¬ 
tempted to murder the Negro 
was not even haled into the court 
for contempt.. 

The courts, by their actions, 
say that white men have a right 
to murder Negro men and women 
if they want to, the time, place and 
manner of the killing is left to 
white men’s selection. White 
men who murder Negroes will 
murder white folks and will be 
just about as careless as to the 
time or place. 

All Were Armed. 

If there is anything connected 
with that mob that challenges 
the admiration of anybody, it 
is the fact that the people they 
lynched were all armed. That 
was unusual and something new 
in mob proseed ings. The usual 
way is to have the officers of the 
law disarm the victims and turn 
them over to the mob. That mob 
evidently regarded it as cowardice 
to have their victims disarmed and 


then bravely (?) lynch them. 
The mob was orderly aside from 
the fuss in the court house, there 
was no other disorder. Having 
completed its work, the members 
of the mob, who were able to ride 
mounted their horses and rode out 
of town. The old way of beating 
and maiming the women, children 
and friends of the mob’s victims, 
wrecking property, etc, was not 
allowed. This shows progress even 
in lynching. This is the only 
country in the civilized world 
where the people propogate and 
protect mobs; and nobody has been 
more lenient to mobs than the 
courts. If lynchings are to con¬ 
tinue, is there any reason why 
courts should be exempt from their 
operations in this country where 
all men are supposed to be equal? 
Lynching is murder, whether the 
victims are black or white, poor 
or rich. Gentlemen, either the 
country or your mob law must 
go. 


A WHITE LIBERTINE FLOGGED 


“It seems that a few weeks ago 
several white apple peddlers visited 
Boley, Okla., and remained over 
night. One of the white men 
made himself very friendly and 
familiar after nightfall with several 
of Boley’s Negro citizens, and finally 
suggested that a colored girl be 
brought to entertain him. He was 
promptly knocked down by the 
Negro young men and thoroughly 
thrashed. He ran from Boley and 
took refuge at Okemah, a white 
town nearby. He got sumpathy 
by telling the officers he had been 
beaten and robbed by Negroes at 
Boley. The white officers went

THE LIBERATOR 


to arrest the Boleyites and their 
treatment was magnified by the 
Okemah Ledger, a white journal, 
into a race riot. ,, 

“The colored paper, the Boley 
Progress, says: ‘Any white gentle¬ 
man who conies to Boley will be 
given coutreous treatment, whether 
he comes on business or sightsee¬ 
ing. 

“ ‘The citizens of Boley realize 
that the white people of the country 
have helped them and are yet 
helping them, and we are not 
ingrates, neither are we all crimi¬ 
nals, but we are not fools. 

“ ‘The low-down, insignificant 
night-riding jackasses, who seem 
to be a cross between a hyena and 
a coyote, and who would lynch a 
Negro man in the daytime and 
would hunt for Negro women at 
night, might as well understand 
that Boley doesn’t give a corru¬ 
gated whoop in hell for their 
presence, and this atmosphere won t 
produce the woman they are look¬ 
ing for.’ ” 


POLITICS DECLARES ROBINS 


“You must bring the morality 
of the men and women in the church¬ 
es out of cold storage and get it 
in action if you wish the church 
to be a world service. 

“Unless the church is ready to 
go into politics and industry for 
social service the kingdom for 
which it prays will never come. 

“Unless the church is ready to 
go into the stram of the modern 
world through collective action, 
it betrays the civilization for which 
it stands. 

“We've got to solve the problem 
of social service at our own city 
doors—we cannot run away, for 
it is here and now. 

“The church must get an awak¬ 
ened Christian conscience which 
will be a function in industrial 
work.”— Raymond Robins in ad¬ 
dress before Ministerial union in 
Men and Religion Forward Move¬ 
ment.

TRY TO BURN CHURCH 


The attempt to burn the Metro¬

Is to be regreted. If colored people 
are to have churches of their own, 
which is their right, they ought 
to build them in Negro settlements.

QUITTING FOOL’S PARADISE 


Speaking of the death of a pro¬ 
minent colored man which took 
place in this city recently, the 
speaker siad: “All Texans who 

appreciate the death of Mr.- 

- rise. Not knowing 

the import of the language, a big 
bunch arose. Some people will 
keep themselves in the lime-light 
no matter how ridiculous. Rev. 

J. A. Stout delivered his farewell 
address, which brought forth many 
expressions of sorrow and a few 
tears. How the city could worry 
along without Rev. Stout was 
voiced by many. Mr. A. J. Jones 
the near-chief and local colored 
Rockerfeller, took the speakers and 
mourners seriously and, failing to 
see how the city could go to pieces, 
while he (Jones) remained in it 
and feeling somewhat piqued at 
being apparently overlooked, 
arose and siad: “Lincoln and Mc- 
Kinly died, and the world didn’t 
stop; I am glad Rev. Stout is 
going; I think we can worry along, 
I’ll be here.” 

The scribbler decided to quit 
“foolin” and go off and make a 
man of himself, and handed in his 
resignation. 

That provoked another fake 
burst of lamentations and reso¬ 
lutions. 

One of our colored attornies 
has been looking after that nurse¬ 
training affair at the County Hos¬ 
pital for some time in the hope of 
adjusting it. The F. P. has decided 
to invite the other colored attor¬ 
nies to come down and discuss the 
matter and tell them whether 
the attorney handling the case is t 
pursuing the proper course. For¬ 
tunately, our attornies would not 
be guilty of such a violation of 
professional ethics.
