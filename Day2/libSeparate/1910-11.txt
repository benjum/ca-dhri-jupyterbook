“WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDS FOR 1 ’ 

By Hiram W. Johnson. 

“It is a human republicanism that we are preaching in the 
State of California today. It is he exaltation of the human being 
in the government of this land. 

“It believes that every child cf this land should have an equal 
start in the race of life, regardless cf conditions of birth or any for¬ 
tuitous circumstances. 

“It is the republicanism, th: t exalts the hum?-n being v hove 
the mere dollar.”

THE LIBERATOR 


Vote Against Hartwell Early and 
Often 

To vote against Mr. Calvin 
Hartwell is a duty of every citi¬ 
zen who would safe-guard hu¬ 
man life, and give to society that 
protection that the enforcement 
of the law guarantees. “During 
Air. Hartwell’s public career he 
has ever proven himself the guar¬ 
dian of the people’s interests,” 
says an advertisement in a local 
paper. Is the above statement 
true. Lets see. When he exon¬ 
erated a policeman for killing a 
NEGRO boy by shooting him in 
the back did he safe-guard the 
people’s interest? The facts brief¬ 
ly stated, are these : An unarm¬ 
ed negro boy was ordered by a 
policeman to halt, instead of obey¬ 
ing he ran, the policeman delib¬ 
erately raised his gun and fired, 
killing the fleeing boy. At the 
incj'uest held by Coroner Hart¬ 
well, the officer was exonerated 
in spite of the fact that the boy 
offered no resistence to the offi¬ 
cer and had neither committed nor 
attempted to commit a felony. Do 
you believe that if the thoughtless 
unfortunate defenseless black boy 
had been white, and the cold¬ 
blooded brutal officer black, that 
he would have escaped without 
facing a jury trial for his life? 
ONE MORE CASE and we are 
done. A respectable negro man 
named Perry, owning a lease near 
El Monte, had a white neighbor 
on adjoining lease. The white 
man took a notion that he ought 
to own both leases. After many 
fruitless efforts to dispossess Per¬ 
ry, the white man decoyed him 
out in the field and shot him to 
death in cold blood. Coroner Hart¬ 
well held what he called an in¬ 
quest and after hearing the story 
told by the murderer hastily ex¬ 
onerated him, thus turning anoth¬ 
er cowardly red-handed murderer 
loose upon society. The outrage 
was so flagrant that the white 
citizens had the murderer re-ar- 
rested, tried and, convicted and 
sent to the penitentiary. That 
lie is in the penitentiary is due to 
the fact that he did not take ad¬ 


vantage of the freedom given him 
by Mr. Hartwell and leave the 
state. 

Mr. Hartwell will, and ought to 
be defeated, and badly too, as bad 
as he was four years ago when as 
the S. P. candidate for tax asses¬ 
sor he ran against that late loyal 
friend of the tax-payers, Ben 
Ward. Personally wc have no ill- 
feeling against Mr. Hartwell. It 
is “his public career' ’that we are 
against. We are against his ad¬ 
ministration of the coroner’s of¬ 
fice, because of its tendency to 
cheapen human life by making it 
easy for cold blooded slayers of 
men to escape the penalty that 
their crimes deserve. This is not 
a race question, but a question of 
the protection of human life. A 
vote against Hartwell is a vote for 
the protection of human life. Vote 
against him. 


WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE 
AND FOUND WANTING 

That will be the verdict of the 
voters of this city and county next 
Tuesday in the case of District 
Attorney Fredericks. His record 
in the graft cases and in the “Red 
Light” scandal has made the office 
of District Attorney a stench in 
the public nostrils. The part he 
took in the King will case in 
which the children were stripped 
of half of the property left them 
by their dead father, is so well 
known to the voters that it need 
not be repeated here. An eminent 
Republican lawyer, discussing the 
case said, “the part that Freder¬ 
icks took ill it justifies disbarment 
proceedings. Capt. Fredericks’ 
conduct of the office of District 
Attorney has been one of incom- 
petencv and inefficiency. His po¬ 
litical record is indefensibly bad 
while that of his opponent, Mr. 
Woolwine is above reproach. 

The majority of the colored vot¬ 
ers like that of the white voters 
are intelligent and want clean ad¬ 
ministration of the law. That the 
Fredericks’ administration has 
been a miserable, if not a criminal 
failure in both particulars is ad¬ 
mitted bv all. Those of the white 


and colored voters who want 
good government, government 
free from graft, maladministration 
and lax enforcement of the law, 
will vote against Mr. Fredericks. 
All of the others, regardless of 
color will vote for him. 

All Negro Killers Freed. 

While the negro voters along 
with the white, deplore the in¬ 
efficient manner in which the 
District Attorney’s office has been 
conducted, the ease with which 
white murderers have escaped 
when negroes were victims, has 
alarmed the thoughtful lav/ abid¬ 
ing negroes throughout the coun¬ 
ty. The fact that Capt. Freder¬ 
icks has not voluntarily brought 
to trial a single white man charg¬ 
ed with murdering a negro dur¬ 
ing the eight y^ars he has been in 
office, has aroused a feeling of re¬ 
sentment in the hearts of justice 
loving white men. His actions in 
this particular have been a scan¬ 
dalous travesty upon justice, a 
disgrace to the city, county and 
state, a cold blooded outrageous 
denial of the protection of the law 
to the tax paying negro citizens. 
The following cases will substan¬ 
tiate the above statement. The 
murderer of Logan on the night 
of Alay 18th, 1905. James Logan, 
a young negro man was decoyed 
from his home and brutally mur¬ 
dered. A bloody handkerchief 
found near his body furnishing an 
unmistakable clew to the perpe¬ 
trators of the murder. While 
Logans body was in the hands 
of the Coroner and District At¬ 
torney, who jointly represented 
the state, the handkerchief was 
taken away by some friend of the 
murderers and his (Logan’s) 
bloody clothes were ordered burn¬ 
ed. That Logan’s clothes un¬ 
doubtedly contained strong clews 
is the presumption or the unpre¬ 
cedented things of burning* them 
before the inquest, would not 
have been allowed. With the tell 
tale handkerchief gone, and his 
clothes with the evidence for the 
state they undoubtedly contained 
burned, Logan’s naked dead body 
cut to ribbons was delivered to

the Coroner’s jury. When the ex¬ 
pensive farce which followed was 
ended. Capt. Fredericks said in 
the presence of the heartbroken 
mother, “I am glad this damned 
thing is over.” Will Capt. Fred¬ 
ericks explain to the colored vot¬ 
ers why he allowed the states evi¬ 
dence to be destroyed in that 
case ? 

A colored tailor of Pasadena 
with absolutely no evidence 
against him, was arrested and put 
in jail as a bluff. 

On Labor Day, 1905, Godfrey, 
a negro, had an altercation with a 
white man. As lie turned to go 
away a bystander, a big burly 
white man, struck him (Godfrey) 
a heavy blow felling him to the 
street, his head striking the stone 
curb was crushed. Capt. Freder¬ 
icks allowed the -murderer to go 
free without a jury trial on the 
plea that Godfrey was killed by 
the fall. Godfrey was a tax payer, 
owning valuable property in this 
city and was regarded as a good, 
industrious citizen. A white po¬ 
liceman arrested a colored boy on 
a charge of misdemeanor. While 
under arrest he ran and on his re¬ 
fusal to stop when ordered to do 
so by the officer, he deliberately 
fired, shooting the unarmed, de¬ 
fenseless boy through the back 
killing him. Capt. Fredericks let 
him go without a trial. Last year 
Perry, a negro was killed in cold 
blood near El Monte by a white 
man, Capt. Fredericks and Cor¬ 
oner Hartwell who always act to¬ 
gether where a negro is the victim 
and promptly set him free. But 
lli'i justice-loving white people 
out there came to Capt. Freder¬ 
icks and demanded that the mur¬ 
derer be rearrested. As a result 
that man is serving 'i 1 years in 
tlie state prison. 

During the teamsters’ strike 
some four or five years ago a col¬ 
ored man named Mullen was at¬ 
tacked while driving his team by 
a striker, or a strike sympathizer. 
In the struggle, Mullen knocked 
his man down killing him. Capt. 
Frederick■■ promptly sent him to 
Ihe s’atcs prison for five years. 


Enough has been said. Every 
negro who thinks, after reading 
.these facts from the records, that 
Capt. Fredericks has given the 
race full protection of the law; 
every negro acquainted with the 
facts who thinks- that Capt. Fred¬ 
ericks has given the negroes a 
square deal ought to vote for 
him. The great body of colored 
voters here left the South to get 
rid of just that sort of treatment 
and will not endorse it with their 
vote next Tuesday. 

These are facts from the public 
records and not unsupported ru¬ 
in or£• ped d 1 ed a ro u n d by race trait- 
ors, scandal mongers and mis¬ 
guided persons who can not rise 
above their prejudices. 

What Claims Has Capt. Freder¬ 
icks Upon the Colored Voters? 
Capt. Fredericks not only has 
not given the negroes the protec¬ 
tion of the law due them along 
with other citizens, but has not 
employed a single negro in any 
capacity whatever in his office. 
Although supported loyally by 
the black Republican lawyers, 
Capt. Fredericks ignored them in 
the selection of his deputies. De¬ 
mocrats not being overlooked. 
\\ hat self respecting negro, wha 
negro worthy of citizenship will 
vote for Fredericks with his un¬ 
savory graft besmered record? 

Hartwell’s Omissions 
No negro has served on a Cor¬ 
oner’s jury since Hartwell took 
the job of coroner, although there 
have been several cases that the 
end?.- of justice would have been 
better served by the presence of 
a negro on the jury. Vote for 
Dr. Pratt, the Good Government 
candidate and put ail end to that, 
sort of discrimination. 

Although there have been many 
inquests requiring medical skill, 
Hartwell has never summoned a 
negro physician in spit? of the 
fact that the negroes have some 
finely equipped men. 

If Hartwell wanted the negro 
vote, he would stop letting white 


mem loose for killing them. 

?? * s ^ 

Hartwell gives all of the col¬ 
ored persons- that fall -into his 
hands to the A. J. Roberts & Co., 
not because he wants to, but be¬ 
cause Porter, who used to be a 
member of the firm, made it un¬ 
popular for while undertakers to 
take from the coroner the bodies 
of colored persons. If ybu will 
notice it, Roberts & Sons Co. 
have never gotten the body of a 
white person from Coroner Hart¬ 
well, unless it laid in the brush 
until it got black. 

If Dr. A. C. Pratt is elected the 
A. J. Roberts & Sons Co. will 
receive the body of every colored 
person that falls into his hands. 
That is a consideration that is 
due them, they being the only 
colored firm. They are in every 
way trustworthy. A vote against 
Hartwell, is a vote for the protec¬ 
tion of human life; especially ne¬ 
gro life? 

V V *3* 

Mr. Schiffman, a millionaire 
Republican rancher of Glendora, 
thus speaks of Mr. Fredericks, in a 
speech at that place on the ’??th : 

“Let me tell you, my friends," 
he said, “that there isn’t a barten¬ 
der in this county dispensing poi¬ 
sons to his patrons; there isn't a 
gambler fleecing his victims in a 
back room: there isn't a grafter 
holding out his hand for a bribe; 
there isn't a fallen woman hid¬ 
ing in her shame; there is not one 
of these who is not shouting, 
‘Hurrah for Fredericks.’ 

“The man’s record is a story of 
incompetence, of evasion of his 
sworn duty, of political intrigue, 
and of habitual use of his public 
office for the benefit of his private 
practice. His so-called defense is 
a tissue of fabrication. He dares 
not answer questions, here or in 
Whittier or Los Angeles or else¬ 
where, because it would- expose 
this deceit." 


It is amazing how many negroes 
who are “s'portin ’ Fredericks" 
would have to leave town if they 
attempted to register.

VICTORY IS CERTAIN 

I he election of the whole re¬ 
publican state ticket is a foregone 
conclusion. Hen. Hiram W. 
Johnson will be one of the best 
governors California ever had. 
As governor every citizen and 
every interest will get a square 
deal and the door of hope will be 
closed to none. 

Four-fifths of the colored vot¬ 
ers will vote the state ticket. On 
the local or county ticket, Cor¬ 
oner Hartwell and Capt. Freder¬ 
icks will be heavily scratched with 
flattering chances of going down 
to ignonimous defeat. 

There are a few disgruntled pol¬ 
iticians known as “sore heads’’ by 
uncharitable people, going about 
veiling for Bell, but the colored 
voters, are alive to the principles 
involved in the present struggle 
and will stand by the republican 
stale ticket. 


20,000 Plurality for A. J. Wallace 

This county ought to give Hon. 
A. J. Wallace, its candidate for 
Lieutenant Governor, a plurality 
of 25,00.0. He is not only the lo¬ 
cal pride of this great city and 
county, but the pride of Southern 
California. He is your friend and 
neighbor, the friend of ns all, a 
quiet unassuming Christian gen¬ 
tleman. As president of the slate 
senate he will lend dignity to that 
body of gentlemen and reflect 
credit upon this entire state. 

As a councilman and the chair¬ 
man of the Finance Committee of 
that body, he found a deficit of 
$400,000 and within three vears 
he retired from office leaving an 
accumulation of $400,000. He will 
as the presiding officer of the sen¬ 
ate save the taxpayers many thou¬ 
sands of dollars. 


Defending Hartwell 

No manly negro will advocate 
the election of Hartwell with his 
record in the Perry case and the 
case of the poor negro boy killed 
by a policeman for running. Sup¬ 
pose he did let a member of the 
race make a few dollars that no 
white man wanted to earn, will 
that pay for lives of the husbands 
and sens of our dear women? Ts 
money worth that much? The at¬ 
tempt to lay the blame for the es¬ 
cape of these red-handed murder¬ 
ers upon the jury is simply ri¬ 
diculous if not criminal. 


GONE INTO THE DEM¬ 
OCRATIC CAMP 

At a meeting of the colored 
me ms Industrial League of Santa 
Monica, held in Phillips chapel, 
corner Bay and Fourth streets, 
Hon. Jas. M. Alexander, state pre¬ 
sident of the Afro-American coun¬ 
cil, and Mr. G. W. Whitley, pres¬ 
ident of the local council, delivered 
eloquent addresses. Their talks 
against Johnson ■ and for Fell 
aroused considerable enthusiasm. 
They seemed to be in dead earnest, 
so much so, that the league was 
turned into a political club at their 
suggestion. 


1 he following prominent gen¬ 
tlemen were present: 

Attorney R. S. Stout, Rev. J. A. 
Stout, Mr. Richman, \Y. M-cx- 
lcy. Geo. Simpson, Rev. S. F. Ed¬ 
wards, C. E. Anthony, Emit Car¬ 
ter, Alex Williams, Mr. Columbus, 
Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Hanson. 
Final instructions will be given 
the voters of the club at their 
next meeting, Nov. 3rd. 



DR. A. C. PRATT. 

I he Good Government candi¬ 
date for coroner is a successful 
physician whose long experience 
eminently fits him for the office 
of coroner. The election of Dr. 
Pratt means not only a square 
deal for all but a reduction of 25 
per cent of the running expenses 
of that office. The present rubber 
stamp coroner not being a physi¬ 
cian, imposes an unnecessary tax 
of $40 upon, the taxpayers for ev- 
•ery autopsy performed on a dead 
body. Dr. Pratt as coroner will 
perform those services himself 
and save the tax payers the ex¬ 
pense. 

The ingenuity displayed by 
Coroner Hartwell in protecting 
the railroads when they kill hu¬ 
man beings is simply marvelous. 
That the voters will smite him 
next Tuesday as they did four 
years ago when he ran as railroad 
candidate for tax assessor against 
the late Ben Ward is one of the 
certainties. 

* J(: * 

-It is enough to make angels 
weep to see the string of dead 
beats that are trailing after Cap¬ 
tain Fredericks. The captain is 
afdieted with the wages of sin.

HON. GAVIN W. CRAIG 


Gavin W. Craig graduated from 
the Pomona high school in the 
class of 181)7. While in school he 
was active in debate and oratory 
and was the first captain of the 
Pomona high school cadet corps, 
which for several years was a 
crsdit to all who were connected 
with it. After finishing the 
schools here Mr. Craig worked 
at any tiring he could get to do 
in Pomona, Chino and other 
neighboring towns until he had 
saved enough money to take him 
through law college. He entered 
the school which is now the Col¬ 
lege cf I .aw of the University of 
Southern California, graduating 
in the first class, that of 11)01. 
From that time until now he has 
engaged in the practice of law in 
Los Angeles; in 1901 he became 
secretary and one of the instruct¬ 


ors of his Alma Mater, at first 
teaching Elementary Law and 
Blackstone, and Torts; during the 
six years that he has been on the 
faculty of U. S. C. Law he has 
taught nearly every subject in a 
law school curriculum, and now 
holds the chairs of Elementary 
Law and Blackstone, Real Prop¬ 
erty, and Water Rights and Irri¬ 
gation Law. 

Mr. Craig has recently compiled 
a book on Water Rights which is 
being introduced in the Lav/ 
Schools of the western states, and 
is preparing a book on Real Prop¬ 
erly. The Law School of the U. 
S. C. is the largest west of Chi¬ 
cago; it has grown from 15 to 
students during the last six 
years and the credit for this un¬ 
usual development is given by the 
students and others who know to 


5 

Secretary Craig more than to any¬ 
one else. He is now Commission¬ 
er of the Superior Court of this 
county, and in this position tries 
cases referred to him by the 
Judges of the Superior Court. 
This is an excellent training for 
the position which he seeks. 

Above everything else Gavin 
W. Craig is absolutely fair and of 
judicial mind; no on? else is in as 
good a position to know that lie is 
just ami impartial as the law s ind¬ 
ents who have been under his gov¬ 
ernment, and, to a man, they arc 
working for him for Judge of the 
Superior Court as are members 
of the Law School Alumni. Mr. 
Craig is a Republican in politics; 
Presbyterian in religion ; is a Scot¬ 
tish rite. Mason, a Sliriner, a mem¬ 
ber of (lie Y. M. C. A. of Los An¬ 
geles, of the City Club, of the Bill- 
iken Club and other organizati ms. 


I take pleasure in calling at¬ 
tention to the card of Gavin \Y 
Craig, the republican nominee for 
Judge of the Superior Conn. 

Air. Craig's peculiar fitness for 
the position to which lie aspires 
merits the support of the voters 
of this community, whether they 
be democrats or republicans. It 
-is. essential that the Judges who 
more or less control our property 
and liberty should be absolutely 
fearless and without any affilia¬ 
tions which might tender to bins 
their judgment.. 

We can truthfully say that 
Craig is such a man, and every 
right minded voter ought to sup¬ 
port him. At the primaries 
Craigs vote was nearly 8,000 
ahead of the next high man. and 
it is the desire of his friends that- 
lie lead by double that amount in 
the general election.—Exchange.

FRANK G. FINLAY,SON. 


A Good Selection for the Bench 
Among- the candidates for judi¬ 
cial honors there arc none more 
worthy the support of the voters 
than Frank G. Finlayson, Repub¬ 
lican candidate for superior judge. 
Mr. Finlayson has been a resident 
of Los Angeles about fifteen years 
and in the present campaign lie 
is receiving the united support of 
nearly every newspaper of any 
importance in the city. He has 
the editorial endorsement of the 
Fveiling Express, the Los Ange¬ 
les Record, the Herald and the 


Examiner. This certainly speaks 
well for Mr. Finlay son's standing 
in his home city, and it is safe 
to assert that if the press of the 
county were not certain of Mr. 
Finlayson’s high qualifications 
for the bench they would not be 
endorsing his candidacy so en¬ 
thusiastically. Mr. Finlayson is 
recognized as one of the leading 
attorneys of the state. His book, 
'‘Finlayson’s Street Law/' is 
quoted as authority in every city 
of California where street work is 
done under the Yrooman act. 


THOMAS LEE WOOLWINE. 

1 he election of Mr. Woolwine 
as District Attorney has long 
since passed the realm of doubt! 
i lie size of his majority is the 
one speculation. The services he 
has rendered the voters of this 
county in exposing graft and 
corruption, if you value civic vir¬ 
tue, is inestimable. The man 
who drives graft and vice from the 
community throws the arm of pro¬ 
tection around the Negro boys 
and girls along with those of the 
whites, regardless of what party 
he belongs or from whence he 
came. He is simply a benefactor 
entitled to the support and com¬ 
mendation of every lover of virtue 
In the present struggle to drive 
graft and venality from power 
tjiere is neither race, color, poli¬ 
tics or section. Those who would 
inject such questions into this 
battle for clean government are 
enemies to society.

JOHN PERRY WOOD 


"Hie Liberator take’s pleasure 
in endorsing John Perry Wood, 
the present city attorney of Pasa¬ 
dena, for.superior court judge. 
Mr. Wood is one of the Republi¬ 
can nominees and is endorsed by 
the Good Government Organiza¬ 
tion. We support him because 
during the eight years that he has 
practiced in Los Angeles county 
he has shown that he is not only 
a man of ability but one who 
stands for a square deal for all 
and that he is not afraid to take 
his stand regardless of any influ¬ 
ences. As City Attorney of Pas¬ 
adena during the last four years 
he has sucessfully conducted 
many important cases. Among 
these are the important and well 
known telephone and telegraph 
litigation between the city and 
the Sunset and Pacific Telephone 
and Telegraph Companies, in¬ 
volving labors in, all the state and 
federal courts, various suits with 
the Edison Company in connec¬ 
tion with the city’s municipal 
lighting matters, involving im¬ 
portant con-titutional questions, 
anl many others. To- him is 
largely due the success of the Pas¬ 
adena Municipal Electric Light¬ 
ing project, of which he has al¬ 
ways been the stout champion, 


not only for his successful work in 
the courts, but for the legal ma¬ 
chinery he has constructed and 
the work he has done to advance 
its administration and resist the 
attacks which have been made up¬ 
on it. 

Recently ten, of the recognized 
leaders of the Los Angeles Bar 
have made public a strong en¬ 
dorsement of Mr. Wood for the 
judgeship. Because this endorse¬ 
ment is the highest compliment 
and at the same time the surest 
guide to the voter who is interest- 
el securing an independent and 
thoroughly able judiciary we pub¬ 
lish it in full, as follows: 

Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 25, 1910. 

We are especially concerned 
that only competent experienced 
and high minded men should be 
elevated to judicial positions. 
Recognizing that Mr. John Perry 
Wood, of Pasadena, who is one of 
the Republican nominees for su¬ 
perior judge of this county, pos¬ 
sesses, in an eminent degree, all 
of these qualifications, we heartily 
endorse Inis candidacy. 

Mr. Wood is a graduate of 
Dickinson college and of Yale 
Law school, has been actively en¬ 
gaged in the practice of his pro¬ 
fession in Los Angelas county, 
for the past eight years, and has 
occupied the office of city attorney 
at Pasadena for the past four 
years. In. the course of his prac¬ 
tice he has handled successfully, 
in the highest courts of the coun¬ 
try, many important cases, and 
has demonstrated his ability as a 
lawyer, and his fidelity as a pub¬ 
lic officer. He is admirably 
equipped by education, experi¬ 
ence and character to discharge 
the duties of superior judge, and 
his election to that office would 
be a distinct gain to the public 
service. In him the people would 
have an. able, painstaking, intel¬ 
ligent and fearless judge.

Colonel W. O. Welch, 

County Tax Collector, 

Los Angeles, Cal., 

Dear Sir—We take this oppor¬ 
tunity of expressing our gratifica¬ 
tion with your nomination at the 
primaries last August, and we sin¬ 
cerely hope you will be successful 
at the election in November. 

For a great many years we have 
known of your ability to manage 
llu* office of County Tax Collector. 
The large amount of business 
which this company transacts 
with your office places us in a po¬ 
sition to judge, perhaps better 
than, anyone else, your qualifica¬ 
tions for that office. 

The “Property Index” originat¬ 
ed and installed by you deserves 
special mention, as it has proven 
to be of invaluable service to the 
public in that it gives immediate 
reference to all property assess¬ 
ments. 

We assure you of our hearty 
support in the management of 
your office, and, if we can be of 
any assistance, it will be a great 
pleasure for us to serve you. 

Very truly yours,

ibis company has come in daily 
contact with your office, having 
observed the increase of bushiest

perfect system inaugurated by

One of the most important

you have personally adopted that 
has been of great value to the

The Title Guarantee and Trust 
Co., of this city wishes to express, 
through its officers, its unquali¬ 
fied endorsement of the admini¬ 
stration of W. O. Welch as Tax 
Collector of this county. Possib¬ 
ly no corporation or business is 
closer to or more familiar with 
the modus operandi of such an 
office as a Title company through 
Us constant visitations therein: 
consequently it knows whereof it 
speaks. 

In the various departments of 
the County Tax Collector’s office, 
wc have found the same complete¬ 
ness in regime: the same vigilance 
and watchful care of the people’s 


interests; the same economy and 
courtesy. We wish to commend 
here particularly, the effective 
and ready system of locating prop¬ 
erty devised by Col. Welch and in 
use in his office. It is a remark¬ 
able fact that the average prop¬ 
erty owner cannot give off hand 
an official description of his hold¬ 
ings, knowing the same by local 
e nv i ro n in en ts o n 1 y. 

The locating system above 
referred to has done away with 
much loss of time and discomfort 
to the tax paving pub Pic.

the people, fortunately is a nomi¬ 
nee for the higher court this yeai 

Judge Nathaniel P. Conrey, who 
from the bench declared that the 
people and not a corporation, had 
the right to enter Catalina island 
freely and at will; who, caused an 
investigation of graft in the public 
schools which was the first step 
towards establishing a non-parti¬ 
san Hoard of Education which has 
given ever)* child, rich or poor, a 
square deal ever since; who was 
one of the legislators to defeat the 
notorious Dan Burns, Southern 
Pacific candidate for the United 
States senate; who has been fore¬ 
most in every movement for the 
uplifting and welfare of the peo¬ 
ple; this judicial officer has been 
nominated for the vacancy in the 
court of appeal, the Southern Cal¬ 
ifornia branch of the supreme 
court of appeal, the Southern Cal¬

Judge Conrey lias resided here 
since 1884. He was fir-t city at¬

1K80. He is seni »r member of the 



HON. WM. D. STEPHENS 


William D. Stephens is the can¬ 
didate of the Republican party in 
this congressional district for the 
office of representative in congress. 

He is in thorough- s)'mpathy and 
accord with the great progressive 
movement that has revitalized the 
party and is fast restoring its his¬ 
toric functions. 

He believes in and practices the 
Republicanism of Roosevelt, La- 
Eollctte, Cummins, Beveridge and 
Bristow, and with all his strength 
he sincerely opposes the Republi¬ 


canism of Aldrich and Hale. In 
the house he will stand against 
Cannonism, against the surrender 
of the constitutional legislative 
powers of the house to a little 
clique obedient to Special Privi¬ 
lege and subject to Private Inter¬ 
est. He will stand with Mur¬ 
dock and the insurgents against 
Dalzell, Cannon and the reac¬ 
tionaries. He will stand for 
the people and against the merce¬ 
naries of Big Business. 

For equal rights to all and op¬ 
posed to special privileges to a fa¬ 
vored few, Stephens is well pre¬ 
pared, bv long acquaintance with 
this district and special knowledge 
of its. needs, to represent it ably 
and intelligently. 

An ardent protectionist, Ste¬ 
phens accepts as declaring the cor¬ 
rect principle of protection the 
Republican pledge to make the dif¬ 
ference in the cost of production 
the measure of protection, with a 
reasonable profit added. What 
hoggish industry can demand 
more? What selfish consumer 
would grant less? 

When a negro is murdered, the 
district attorney can’t do anything, 
the coroner can’t do anything, so 
the murderer, if he is white, just 
goes scot free. That's the way it 
is put by a negro lawyer who is 
supporting Fredericks.

ONCE SLAVE COMES 

TO REST IN PEACE 

SAWTELLE, (Jet. 25.—After 
a life of 80 years in the South, in 
which she was twice sold as a 
slave, separated in childhood from 
her mother, and herself brought 
up a family of 11 children, Mrs. 
Sally Moore has arrived here 
from Valdosta, Ga., to pass her 
remaining days with her son-in- 
law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. J. 
L. Edmonds "at Fourteenth street 
and Minnesota avenue. 

She madle the journey alone. 
Though she* had never been in 
the West before, Mrs. Moore says 
that she knew al once when she 
had reached the section of the 
country which is given that gen¬ 
eral designation, solely by the dif¬ 
ference in the way she was treat¬ 
ed on the train. Until She arriv¬ 
ed at Kansas City, she «ays she 
could not buy meals in the rail¬ 
road eating houses, had only a 
few mouthfuls of light lunch to eat 
and received no assistance from 
anyone on the train. At Kansas 
City a kind hearted California wo¬ 
man saw her plight and aided her 
by procuring the lunches for her. 

Mrs. Moore was born at Charles 
City, Va. When a young girl, 
her owner, S. Christian, came to 
California to live and she was sold 
on the auction block to satisfy 
debts and because lie was afraid 
she might be freed on the way if 
sent to California. Her buyer 
paid -$105(1 for her and took her 
to Macon, leaving her mother be¬ 
hind. They never saw each other 
again but kept up a correspond¬ 
ence till the death of the older 
woman. 

A few years later she was sold 
again for the same price, Henry 


Moore of Valdosta being the 
buyer. He was killed in the war. 

Mrs. Moore has served three 
generations of white folks as a 
cook. The years have given her 
few gray hairs, her eyesight is 
excellent and she is happy to be 
reunited to her daughter, from 
whom she had been separated for 
many years. Only one daughter 
and one son remain of the three 
boys and eight girls that she 
brought into the world. 

TRUTH ABOUT LIBERIA 

The “Back to Africa” move¬ 
ment has received a decided set¬ 
back from exposure of the con¬ 
ditions which exist in the Liber¬ 
ian republic, and the methods of 
government, which prevail there. 

Liberia is populated by the de¬ 
scendants of American negroes, 
who, prior to the Civil War, were 
sent there by the American Colo¬ 
nization' Society; equipped with 
agricultural .and mechanical ma¬ 
chinery, seeds, animals, clothing, 
furniture,merchandise and money, 
with the expectation that they 
would gradually civilize and as¬ 
similate with the people of adja¬ 
cent tribes, and build up an Afri¬ 
can republic that should demon¬ 
strate the capacity of the negro 
race to achieve a high degree of 
civilization and progress, and that 
they would establish a govern¬ 
ment that would command the re¬ 
spect and friendship of the na¬ 
tions of the world, and serve as a 
factor in solving the then existing 
problem of African slavery. 

Eighty-eight years ago Henry 
Clav and other humanitarian 
slaveholders in the South, and 
Gerret Smith and other abolition¬ 
ists in the North organized the 
American Colonization Society. 
About twelve thousand free ne¬ 
groes and mul at toes were, dur¬ 
ing that and succeeding years, 
sent to the west coast of Africa. 

These colored men and their.de¬ 
scend cuts have theoretical juris¬ 
diction over 550 miles of WLst 
African coast line and 48 ,()<m) 
square miles of West African ter¬ 
ritory. but practically they oren- 



























THE LIBERATOR

py only a small area of land back 
of Monrovia on the seacoast. The 
population of Liberia is loosely 
estimated at two millions, but 
four-fifths or more of it consists 
of Mohammedan Man dingo and 
Pagan Km negroes, who have 
never been civilized or Christian¬ 
ized or affiliated with by the 
American contingent, and who do 
not participate in the government 
of Liberia. 

The Monrovia government ex¬ 
torts fines and taxes from these 
tribes, but otherwise has nothing 
to do with them. Recently one 
of the Kru tribes, called the Gree- 
bos, revolted against the Monro¬ 
via government, because of the 
oppressive manner in which the 
Liberians have enslaved the Gree- 
bos, burned their homes and kill¬ 
ed their youths. 

King Gyude, Chief of the Gree- 
bos, recently offered their coun¬ 
try to England, saying: “The ob¬ 
ject for which Liberia was colo¬ 
nized has not been realized, and 
Liberian domination does not 
make for good government, Chris¬ 
tianity or civilization. We are 
constrained to offer our country 
to some European power whose 
methods of colonization arc iess 
onerous.” 

The existence of the Republic 
of Liberia, ruled as it is by a lit¬ 
tle band of mulatto thieves and 
grafters, is maintained by the 
great European powers—Eng¬ 
land, France and Germanv—from 
different motives. England 
wishes to prevent Germany from 
increasing her possessions in Af¬ 
rica. or from obtaining a coaling 
depot at Monrovia, and further 
desires to prevent either France 
or Germany from securing a sup¬ 
ply of voluntary exportable labor 
from the Kru tribes of the coast 
line. The African possessions of 
France surround Liberia on all 
sides except the seaboard and 
northwest corner, and France 
would annex all of Liberia if Ger¬ 
many and England would let her. 
while Germany would quickly ex¬ 
tend her important commercial 
concerns in West Africa by ac¬ 


quiring Liberia if England and 
France would let her. 

Concerning these conditions 
and their effect upon the future 
of Liberia a correspondent of an 
English magazine writes: 

“In the midst of this turmoil of 
conflicting interests,a handful of 
American negroes, inflated with 
the exaggerated notion of their 
own importance which it lias been 
the policy of the Powers to fos¬ 
ter for their own purpoess; deep¬ 
ly suspicious of Europeans; utter¬ 
ly incapable of imposing their au¬ 
thority upon the aboriginal pop¬ 
ulation who do not acknowledge 
them; possessing neither admini¬ 
strators nor soldiers: corrupt and 
incompetent, play their foolish lit¬ 
tle farce of self-government, with 
their Cabinet, Senate, and House 
of Representatives; indulge in 
their wretched little disputes, their 
elections, their religious bicker¬ 
ings, their theological disquisi¬ 
tions; existing at all, not by merit 
of their own labors or by the 
fruits of their own toil, but by 
customs dues levied upon trade 
between the Europeans and the 
aborigines, enforced often enough 
by the raids of an undisciplined 
militia or by the operation of a 
solitary gunboat which British 
philanthropy supplies them with.” 

The status is at once ludicrous 
and pathetic, in volves the utmost 
discredit to the Powers who have 
tolerated it so long, is unfair to 
the Liberians themselves, gravely 
unjust to the aboriginal popula¬ 
tion, and a bar to all possibility 
of progressive advance on their 
part.
