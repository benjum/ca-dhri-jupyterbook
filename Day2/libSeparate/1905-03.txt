Mr. Slavin Defines His 
Position. 

Strongly in Favor of Municipal 
Ownership—Preference to Local 
Labor on Public Contracts. 
Believeing that the citizens and voters 
who support a candidate for an offiffice 
of as high importance as that of Mayor 
of a progressive and prosperous city, 
like Pasadena, are justly entitled to 
some knowledge of that candidate’s posi¬ 
tion respecting questions of municipa 
policy, I desife to respectfully submit 
the following statement regarding sev¬ 
eral matters of present popular inter- 
est. 

First: I believe that Pasadena has, 
to a large extent, attracted and held its 
highly intelligent and progressive citi¬ 
zens by the temperance laws, which are 
now embodied in its charter, and the 
strict and effective enforcement of which 
laws I most heartily favor. 

Second: I am, as I always have been, 
in favor of the acquirement by the city 
of such public utilities as are necessary 
for its growth and development, and 
their operation for the exclusive bene¬ 
fit of the consumer and taxpayer; but 
favor such acquirement only at such 
times as will prove less burdensome to 
the taxpayer. I also believe that such 
utilities, when they are operated by the 
city, should be operated as economically 
as a man’s own private business, and 
not for the benefit of any class of polit¬ 
ical faction. 

Third: It is my belief that the bur¬ 
den of taxation necessary to maintain 
our city government can, with wise econ¬ 
omy, be made to bear less heavily on 
the various classes and conditions of 
our citizenship, and, by good manage¬ 
ment, a more even distribution of tfiat 
burden secured. 

Fourth: I believe that a city govern¬ 
ment, in order that it may be of the 
highest service to the people, must main¬ 
tain a spirit of co-operation and har¬ 
mony between its executive and legis¬ 
lative branches, and to this end, each 
branch should perform its duties and 
obligations, and exercise its perogatives 
in a spirit of fairness, toward the other, 
without arrogance or undue dictation. 
This object can only be attained by de¬ 
liberations conducted in a spirit of mu¬ 
tual endeavor, counsel and advice, and 


THE LIBERATOR. 

such a spirit I will, if elected, carry to 
the executive chair. 

Fifth: In all public contracts, I am 
decidedly in favor of giving preference 
to our home contractors, when such 
preference can be given legally; and I 
most especially favor the employment 
of home labor upon all such work. In 
this connection I point to my own prac¬ 
tice in the past as evidence of my sin¬ 
cerity. I also favor an eight hour per 
day regulation for all labor employed by 
the city. 

Sixth: That no monopolistic or ex¬ 
clusive privileges should be granted or 
permitted where the same can be avoid¬ 
ed. and never without due provision for 
adequate recompense, oversight and rea¬ 
sonable control. 

Seventh: I believe in so regulating 
the speed of electric cars and the proper 
screening of the electric headlights so 
that the same may not prove a public 
menace. 

Eighth: Since the tourists of today 
mav become the citizens of tomorrow, 
and since it is evident that our own peo¬ 
ple desire the growth of our city in at¬ 
tractiveness, I believe that every effort, 
consistent with economy, should be made 
to maintain our beautiful parks, to put 
and keep streets and avenues in good 
condition, by permanent improvement, 
followed by timely and systematic re¬ 
pair, and to critically supervise and per¬ 
fect sanitary conditions, to ’the end that 
the health and happiness of present resi¬ 
dents may be promoted, and a steady 
growth and prosperity insured. 

Ninth : In conclusion, I desire to state 
that I am fortunate in entering this cam¬ 
paign without being hampered by any 
pledges or obligations whatever. In the 
event of my endorsement by my fellow- 
citizens, I shall enter upon my duties 
entirely free from promises regarding 
the appointments to be made. No fav¬ 
oritism to persons, party or faction will 
have a place in the performance of my 
duties. I shall be free to deal with all 
in perfect fairness, and, if elected to 
the office of Mayor of the City of Pasa¬ 
dena, I do hereby pledge myself to give 
to said office and to the performance of 
its duties, my entire time and my best 
endeavors, and will do all in my power 
to carry out the principles enunciated. 

MATHEW SLAVIN. 


WASHINGTON’S WORDS OF 
WISDOM. 

"Calmness and confidence are power¬ 
ful factors in the progress of a race as 
well as in that of an individual. The 
work accomplished by this organziation 
with its numerous ramifications, should 
convince us that the policy for the race 
to pursue, is to continue its course of 
seeking quietly, patiently and courage¬ 
ously after the essentials of life. We 
should more and more accustom our¬ 
selves to be unspoiled by praise or dis¬ 
couraged by blame. 

“One definite success in a given direc¬ 
tion wiill often go farther in the solution 
of perplexing problems than all the ora¬ 
tions and glittering generalities that can 
be summoned to plead our cause. In 
the last analysis, the world judges a 
race by its ability to show definite re¬ 
sults of progress, by its ability to achieve 
the highest usefulness. With such evi¬ 
dences of progress always present, no- 
untoward influence can permanently 
hoild a people back; without such evi¬ 
dence no amount of artificial stimulation 
can push a people permanently forward. 
Material possessions should not be 
sought as an end but as a means to help 
us forward toward high moral and re¬ 
ligious living. When a race owns land 
and houses and has a bank account, these 
possessions indicate that that race has 
learned to make sacrifices, to do without 
today that it may possess tomorrow; 
has learned to look ahead and plan for 
the future. When a man becomes the* 
owner of a piece of property and a tax¬ 
payer in his community, as a rule there 
comes to him added sdlf-respect and 
added confidence from his neighbors. 


EDITOR GREEN ENDORSED. 

State Printer Shannon says, that the- 
present set of journal clerks of the As¬ 
sembly are the most efficient the state 
has had during his administration. As 
Editor Green is proofreader, this is a 
splendid endorsement of his ability. As 
representatives of the race, Green, Eas¬ 
ton and Crumbly are all right. 


Mr. W. H. Washington, the real estate 
man, has removed his office from the 
Wilson block, to 241 East Second street, 
where he will be pleased to meet his- 
old friends. Mr. Washington conducts- 
a regular real estate, rental and loan 
business, and all matters entrusted to- 
him will be properly handled.

ability in time and or money. 

To live in the midst of schools, li¬ 
braries, museums, lectures, picture-gal¬ 
leries, and improvement clubs and not 
to avail one’s self of their advantages.— 
Tuskegee Student. 


COMMUNICATED. 

Editor Liberator: In the recent city 
election which resulted in the selection 
of Republicans, Democrats and every¬ 
thing else on the list. Sixteen hundred 
registered colored voters took an active 
part and publicly surported the men of 
their choice without regard to party af¬ 
filiation. Two years ago a few colored 
men had the courage to openly support 
M. P. Snyder a democrat, for mayor, he 
was elected and proved himself worthy 
of their confidence, by giving the race 
positions on the police, fire and street de¬ 
partments, and many of his colored 
friends voted for him on Dec. 5, and 
worked for his re-election, we do not 
condemn them for the position they took 
against the Republican ticket, they are 
citizens, and if it is good politics for 
white men to act independently, and vote 
to suit their best interest, which has prov¬ 
ed to be a success with him, it is wisdom 
for the colored man to imitate them in 
this respect, and since the colored man 
vote~ almost to a man, for Mr Hanley, 
as against Mr, Werdin, it can be said now 
with a strong degree of certainty, that 
the colored voter of this city, is an in¬ 
dependent voter and uses his franchise 
to the best interest of the city and his 
home a few years ago it was com¬ 
mon talk to say such and such an editor 
or merchant or expressman, was a demo¬ 
crat, and this simply because they voted 
independently to the republican -ticket, 
but now it would take a whole page or 
two. of either of our big daily papers, to 
print the list of names of the sixteen 
hundred colored men of this city, who 
supported the Democratic nominees in 
one or more cases, in the last city elec¬ 
tion. It cannot be -charged hereafter, 
that Edmonds and Flint are the only 
Democratic colored men in Los Angeles, 


for they are here by the hundreds, and 
what a blessing it is -that the colored 
voter is beginning to act openly, what he 
has been knowing and talking about the 
past twenty years. He is aware of the 
fact that he has been enslaved by the 
Red Shirt argument, and the party lash, 
but here in Los Angeles every voter is 
needed, and if the colored man will line 
up into a solid phlanx as a Cooper union 
or Tamany Hall, he will be the balance of 
power in the approaching city, county 
and state election, that will be telling in 
its effect for the good of the city, and the 
negro, as a part of the population. 

The time to do this is now, and Los 
Angeles is the place. We are not in the 
south where the negro vote is not wanted 
or needed. Let all the colored men as¬ 
semble and organize a union, rent a hall, 
hire a-keeper or secretary, subscribe for 
the leading race, and daily papers, have 
monthly smokers, with good rousing 
speaking, and get in line for a big battle 
two years hence.

EASTON APPOINTED. 

In appointing Prof. Easton one of the 
deputy tax collectors for Los Angeles 
county, Mr. Ben E. Ward has rewarded 
a faithful and self-sacrificfiing Republi¬ 
can and recognized the Negro voters of 
Los Angeles. Prof. Easton’s work dur¬ 
ing the past campaigns while president 
of the Roosevelt Reoublican Club met 
the hearty approval of the membership 
and party as well. Senator Flint, at the 
time of his local campaign, whose can¬ 
didacy the Club indorsed, communicated 
a letter of appreciation to the members 
of the Club through Prof. Easton. The 
Enterprise congratulates its friend Eas¬ 
ton on the appointment and feels sure 
that while Mr. Ward has always -re¬ 
ceived a very large colored vote, that 
the colored men will show him their un¬ 
mistakable appreciation two years hence 
if he desires to succeed himself.—The 
Enterprise. 

The above, from the Enterprise, is the 
sentiment of Hie Liberator. Prof. Eas¬ 
ton is in every way worthy and his ap¬ 
pointment is gratifying to the colored 
voters. The Liberator writes Mr. 
Ward’s name on its list containing names 
of those who are friendly to the race.

SHOULD VOTE FOR HON. 
MATHEW SLAVIN. 

In the mayoralty contest now on in 
Pasadena The Liberator has no hesi¬ 
tancy in advising to the colored voters, 
to vote for Hon. Mathew Slavin, for 
mayor. Not because his election is, 
almost, if not assured; but because the 
gentlemen backing his candidacy, are 
true and tried friends of the negroes, 
which is a guarantee of fair play for 
them in event of his election. Elsewhere 
in these columns, will be found Mr. 
Slavin’s platform, which should be care¬ 
fully read. It covers every issue in¬ 
volved in the contest, and will be lived 
up to if he is elected. Every vote cast 
for Mr. Slavin b' r the colored voters, is 
a vote cast for the continuation of the 
liberal policy of the present administra¬ 
tion. In the distribution of the public 
work, the colored voters will have a 
“square deal/’ in other words, will be 
treated as other citizens. They could 
ask for nothing more, and will receive 
nothing less, if Mr. Slavin is elected. 
The further fact that Mr. Slavins has 


THE LIBERATOR. 

regular colored employes, is. the best 
proof of his friendliness for the race. 

The position of the Liberator is well 
known to the colored voters of Pasa¬ 
dena. It cares nothing for party, or 
lines, but supports for office only such 
men as we believe will deal justly by the 
negro. The policy of this paper is 
shaped by the idea that we owe to the 
negro our first services. In pursuit of 
this policy we say to the colored of 
Pasadena, that their best interest will be 
served by voting for the Hon. Mathew 
Slavin, for mayor. While his opponents 
are both good men, his value as a prac¬ 
tical business man, has added so much to 
the growth of Pasadena, and his candi¬ 
dacy appeals strongly to all citizens de¬ 
siring its continuation. 

The magnificent Slavin block, corner of 
Colorado street and Fair Oaks avenue, 
is proof that his administration will 
be wise, conservative and practical. 

Hon. Mathew Slavin, Candidate for 
Mayor of Pasadena. 


THE TIMES AND THE COLORED 
FOLKS. 

Among the colored folks there is 
growing inquiry why it is that, although 
the Times publishes more and stronger 
editorials in favor of giving the negro 
fair nlay than perhaps all of the other 
city papers put together, that it is the 
only paper that refers to the negro as 
a “coon” and to the negro woman as a 
negress. We believe that if the man¬ 
agers of that great paper knew the dam¬ 
age done the colored fellow citizens by 
creating prejudice and contempt for 
them this catering to the ^ vicious ele¬ 
ment of society would be discontinued. 
The damage done the negro bv this kind 
of journalism is inestimable. A strong 
editorial appeared in the Times con¬ 
demning the treatment Prof. Booker T. 
Washington received in Kansas, and 
then refers to a negro in the police court 
as a “coon.” Now the number of white 
people who read the police and divorce 
court proceedings, and, who read the 
pink section and keen their mouths ever 
open to catch crumbs from the scandal 
mill, compared to those who read the 
Times editorials are as io is to 2, It 
is very largely those of the former class 
who hate the negro and in fact, every¬ 
thing pertaining to law and order. Since 
this class is dependent for its education 
upon the scandal mills, police and di¬ 


vorce court proceedings and sporting 
news, this department of the great daily 
papers, in the interest of society should 
be as decent as possible, in language as 
well as sentiment. 

The average reader of the smutty ht- 
literature referred to soon reaches the 
conclusion that a race that allows itself 
to be insulted and slandered daily with¬ 
out some sought of protest, is worthy 
of nothing but contempt, and to insult 
such a people without provocation is 
regarded by them as an evidence of su¬ 
periority. A man may say “nigger” for 
the same reason that some educated peo¬ 
ple say “git,” but -the man who refers the 
negro as a “coon” does so to insult or 
create contempt for him. It is 'this 
kind of journalism that made the tteat 
ment Prof. Washington received in 
Kansas, possible in a northern citv. to 
this is due prejudice that is bringing 
the religion and civilization of the north 
into the contempt of the heathen. This 
catering by the white dailies to the 
vicious element of society has spread 
crime broadcast, menaced virtue, de¬ 
stroyed the sanctity of the home and 
so corrupted the minds of the reading 
public that no daily paper can exclude 
front its columns and live the nauseat¬ 
ing proceedings of divorce courts, ac¬ 
counts of seduction, proctotution, race 
track gambling and things that lower 
the moral standards the hoys and girls 

read them. . , _ k 

And strange to say, it is only Repub¬ 
lican papers that refer to the negro as 
“coon” and negro women as ne°resses 
and wenches. As the Times has a big¬ 
ger circulation among the colored citi¬ 
zens than any paper west of the Rockies, 
they expect of it better things.

..THE ENTERPRISE OCCUPIES.. 

NEW QUARTERS. 

The Enterprise now occupies a large 
and well appointed home at 241 E. Sec¬ 
ond street. Editor Greene has been for¬ 
tunate in securing the services of Mr. 
j l Rogers of New Orelans, La., a 
newspaper man of ability and well 
known throughout the country. The 
Enterprise is indeed enterprising. 


























A GREAT VICTORY. 

The defeat and almost annihilation of 
the Russian Army of a half million 
men and capture of Mukden by the Jap¬ 
anese army, commanded by Field Mar¬ 
shal Oyama, is the greatest victory of 
modern warfare, if not any other war¬ 
fare. The combatants were evenly 
matched as far as numbers go, with the 
advantage of fortifications in favor of 
the Russians. In spite of the difficul¬ 
ties that the attacking party must al- 
wavs surmount in such cases, Oyama, 
without shelter, in the face of 2000 pieces 
of modern artillery, like a thunder-bolt 
hurled his now matchless legions against 
the Russian left and tore it into shreds, 
the center was hammered in twain and 
the right bent almost double. When an 
opportunity was needed to strike a vital 
spot a telling blow, Oyama by his mili¬ 
tary genius, made the opportunity. The 
hammering all along the Russian front 
was so relentless, so incessant, the fire 
so withering, they fled from the field 
a panic-stricken mob, only to be ruth¬ 
lessly slaughtered by their victorious 
pursuers. In bravery and bull dog 
tenacity, the Russian soldiers were not 
wanting. Their physical in durance 
seemed to have reached the limit. They 
succumbed to superiority of generalship, 
marksmanship and physical training 
The rank and file of the Russian army 
did as well as any soldiers representing 
the same civilization could have done. 
From this point of view the present 
struggle between the so-called Christian 
and heathen nations, furnishes a splen¬ 
did object lesson. The “heathen Jap” 
by living and practicing the tenets of 
his faith, goes forth to battle, the 
embodiment of physical perfection, be¬ 
ing taught that to die for one’s country 
is a sure passport to paradise; death 
has no terror for them, being taught that 
dishonesty, intemperance and licentious¬ 
ness are degrading, weakening sins, and 
are to be avoided as one would a pesti¬ 
lence. Hence they enjoy every blessing 
that comes to the virtuous, temperate 
living.. 

All Japanese citizens are equal; all 
enjoying equal opportunity. The Rus¬ 
sians unfortunately, like many other so- 
called Christian nations, practice every 
vice that their religion denounces. In¬ 
temperance, licentiousness and dishon¬ 
esty, ramifies every stratum of society. 
Although taught that sin is deadly to 


THE LIBERATOR. 

nations as well as in dividuals, the sale 
of license to commit sin, is the govern¬ 
ment’s most important source of reve¬ 
nue. The Christian’s religion teaches 
its devotees that it is a virtue to aid 
the weak and raise the fallen, but they 
stand upon the fallen to exploit the weak. 
These are little things but in the supren\e 
test they are the things that count for, 
or against you. The “heathen Japanese” 
are fighting to protect the weak, the 
Christian (?) Russians are fighting to 
increase the power of the strong to op¬ 
press and rob them. It may be, that 
while Christians are worshipping the 
golden calf, the heathen may be gath¬ 
ered from the highways and hedges and 
given seats at the King’s feast. 


NEGROES TO BE APPOINTED TO 
OFFICE IN THE NORTH AS 
WELL AS IN SOUTH. 

Washington, March 4.— (Exclusive 
Dispatch.) President Roosevelt is go¬ 
ing to apply his negro policy to the 
North as well as the South, and in 
cities where there is a large negro popu¬ 
lation he will recognize that population 
by appointing some negro Federal office 
holders. In conformity w ; th that policy, 
the President will soon appoint a negro 
collector of internal revenue in New 
York City. 


NEED OF ORGANIZATION. 

Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish a letter from one of our prominent 
citizens signed “Subscriber,” urging the 
necessity of the colored voters organiz¬ 
ing now, for the political battle two 
years’ hence. The idea is a capital one, 
and, :an Afro-American Protective Asso¬ 
ciation of something of the kind should 
be organized at once, and should be 
strictly independent in politics. It should 
see that every qualified voter is regis¬ 
tered and pay taxes and allow no grafter 
nor chronic office seekers to hold office 
in the organization. 

The main object , the only object of 
the organization should be the promo¬ 
tion of the negro politically and other¬ 
wise. The votes of the organization 
should be cast solidly for those candi¬ 
dates for office, who have proven them¬ 
selves friends to the negro, by their 
willingness to give him a “square deal” 
in the distribution of official patronage. 
Others should be voted against, no mat¬ 
ter what party name they may be using 
to get into office. With an organization 
of 500 colored voters who put the inter¬ 
est of the race first, and party next, 
each member paying one dollar into the 
treasury, a campaign could be inaugur- 


5 

ated that would be felt and respected 
throughout the state. If such an or¬ 
ganization is started and the right kind 
of men are placed in charge—men who 
are willing to give their time and money 
to_ make it a success, 1000 members with 
one dollar each can be easily secured 
in sixty days. As the colored voters are 
tired of the discrimination that is every¬ 
where being practiced against them and 
are ripe for such a movement. What 
organization has done for the Irish and 
Germans, the organized negro vote 
with the same end in view, will no for 
the negroes. 

The negro is an American citizen, en¬ 
titled to every right, civil and political, 
enjoyed by other citizens. If any of 
these rights are denied him, he will have 
to apply the same remedy that white 
citizens apply—vote against every officer 
who fails to enforce the laws or in any 
way discriminates against them. Know¬ 
ing the remedy, if the. negro has not the 
manhood to apply it, he and his children 
will simply be lick spittles, no matter 
what party is in power. If the best re¬ 
sults are to be obtained, organization is 
absolutely necessary in order that our 
entire weight can be hurled against the 
enemies of our rights—those who would 
in any way discriminate against us. 


BLEEDING KANSAS. 

The passage of a separate school law 
in Kansas is a step backward that no 
state can afford to take at this time. By 
signing the bill, prompted as it was by 
vile prejudice, the governor of Kansas 
has allowed himself to be made the tool 
of the lowest element of society. It 
seems incredible that Kansas, the first 
northern state to shed the blood of its 
citizen for freedom and fair play, should 
be the first to yield to the infamous de¬ 
mands of the same element that sent the 
border ruffians into her territory to 
murder her people for the crime of 
wanting their state to be free from the 
hellish traffic in the souls and bodies of 
men, women and children. By yield¬ 
ing to the low negro-hating element, the 
governor has opened the way for future 
trouble and humiliation for Kansas. 
The negro hater like slavery, of which 
he is the degraded offspring, once given 
the lead, goes crazy. Patriotism, loy¬ 
alty, obedience to law, mental and moral 
improvement, the hammering of pover¬ 
ty into homes and ignorance into intel¬ 
ligence amounts to nothing if the pos¬ 
sessor, the doer, is a negro. It simply 
increases the hatred of a certain ele¬ 
ment, an element that practically dictates 
the legislation of the greater part of 
this country. But we are not discour¬ 
aged. We have seen darker days. We 
were in Mississippi when John Brown 
the liberator was hanged. The darkest 
part of the night is just before the 
breaking of the day.

THE LIBERATOR. 

THE HUMILIATION OF RUSSIA. 

Russia's attempt to steal Manchuria, 
divide up China, absorb Corea and 
finally subjubate Japan is meeting with 
a - dismal failure. Her occupation of 
Manchuria by false pretense was a part 
of the plan to steal all the territory in 
sight, belonging to the dark races and 
murder all petfsons in the territory 
stolen who had the hardihood to oppose 
it. Of course, the other so-called Chris* 
tian nations would have submitted to 
the robbery and butchery under the 
pretense that white supremacy, Chris¬ 
tianity, civilization demanded the 
slaughter of men and raping of women 
in their own homes. But Japan took 
time by the forelock and is wiping up 
the earth with her. She gave Russia so 
many days to get out of Manchuria, 
which the haughty Slavs refused to do, 
only to be flung out bodily as a strong 
man would a burglar. Russia s navy, 
the proud Pacific, fleet, decorates the 
bottom of the ocean. Her second 
squadron is afraid to leave her coast 
line. Her army having won not a 
single battle, has been beaten and driven 
drom pillar to post, and today it is not 
allowed to stop long enough to cook a 
-meal. 

The Russian defeat at Mukden was 
the most crushing, the most humiliating 
in the history of modem warfare. It 
wiped out completely whatever was left 
of Russian prestige with lier navy de¬ 
stroyed, her army, in the far e'ist, anni¬ 
hilated, anarchy and revolution at home. 
Russia is indeed in the vale of pity and 
humiliation. The end is not yet. 

Of her losses at Mukden there were 
•200,000 men, 110,000 of whom were 
killed or wounded. 

The spoils include two flags, about 60 
guns, 60 rifles, 150 ammunition wagons, 
1000 bushels of cereals. 275,000 bushels 
of fodder, 45 miles of light railway out¬ 
fit, 2000 horses, 23 cartloads of maps, 
1000 cartloads of clothing and accouter¬ 
ments, 1,000.000 rations of bread, 70,- 
000 tons of fuel and 60 tons of hay, be* 
sides tools, tents, bullocks, telegraph 
.wire and poles, timber., beds, stoves and 
much other property. 

Later reports bring up the Russian 
losses, so far as it has been possible, 
to count them, to these figures: Ru*- 
sian casualties, 110.000; guns captured, 
66; rifles, 62,000; shells, 211,500. 

Besides, Kuroki reports that al¬ 
though the retreating Russians set fire 
to the warehouses at Machuntan and 
Miulupao, he captured thousands of 
bushels of provisions, immense quanti¬ 
ties of ammunition and fodder, num¬ 
bers of horses and bullocks, materials 
for a light railway thirty-three miles 
long, 450 wagons for railway, 6000 in¬ 
trenching tools, 12,000 bundles of wire, 
numerous telephones, coal mining ma¬ 
chinery for eight pits (the mines being 
at Fvil’un), and. great stores of char¬ 
coal. 

What a warning this should serve 
upon this and other countries that are 


allowing robbers and murderers of the 
weak- to go unpunished. Allow it to be- 
done under whatever pretext you may, 
the punishment will follow as sure as 
God lives, for “The God that reigned 
over Babylon is the God that is reign 
ing now." 

John Chinaman kept a straight face 
until Oyama's tremendous victory reach¬ 
ed his ears. Then he broke lopse and 
is now shooting, off fireworks with an 
abandon and glee that leaves no doubt 
as to which side of the fence he w 
on from the start. Jap and Chink ar 
new reunited in the ancient bonds of 
biotherly love, and they both hate a 
*U‘te man with the same earnest en 
t Hisu.sm that no cnm1 # Js said to re¬ 
gard holy water.—The limes. 

How could it be otherwise, n the 
Chinaman still remembers the raping ot 
their women and girls and the merci¬ 
less slaughter of their brethren by the 
allied white Christian armies in their 
march to Pekin a few years ago. Mur¬ 
der rape pillage and robbery blackened 
every rod of their march. The “heathen 
Japanese soldiers alone maintained their 
decorum and refrained from that hell 
black crime. It was the Japs first 
lesson in Christian civilization and he 

rightly loaths it still. 

• * * * 

Down in Mississippi it takes five 
hundred armed white people to lynch 

orunarmed negro for whipping a 
white man. It is now suggested that 
all the white nation on earth form 

a mob, on the Mississippi plan, and go 
over and lynch the little brown men 
for whipping Russia for attempting a 
hold up game in the far east. But 

these brothers have such a little confi¬ 
dence in each other that they cannot 

reach an agreement, fearing that some 
of them might slip back home and steal 
all that’s left. Then, too, the promiscu¬ 
ous mingling would result in wholesale 
pocket oicking. Evil is sometimes pro¬ 
duct v e of good. _
