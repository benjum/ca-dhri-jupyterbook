The Constitution League 
After the Nullifiers. 

The Nation’s Hypocracy 
Aired. 

THE CONSTITUTION LEAGUE. 

On the evening of February 5th, the 
Constitution League held a great 
meeting in New York city. At that 
meeting Hon. John E. Milholland de¬ 
livered a remarkable speech condemn¬ 
ing existing conditions. Dr. W. E. B. 
DuBois, Mrs. Mary Church Terrel and 
Ex-Congressman White of North Car¬ 
olina, also delivered addresses. Their 
addresses published in full the issue 
of the Richmond Planet of February 
17th and 24th, ought to be published 
in pamphlet form and scattered 
throughout the country. For lack of 
space we publish below a few para¬ 
graphs, from the speeches of Hon. 
John E. Mulholland an<^ the scholarly 
Dr. W. E. B. DuBois. The meeting 
held in New York and the Georgia 
Equal Rights convention held in Ma¬ 
con, Ga., on February 13th and 14th, 
and the Niagara movement taken to¬ 
gether, marks the beginning of an or¬ 
ganized fight against the nullification 
of the Afro-American constitutional 
rights so rampant in the South. The 
address issued by the Georgia con¬ 
vention is a masterly portrayal of the 
outrages practiced upon the negroes 
of the state. 

The following paragraphs from 
Mulholland’s great speech will give 
only a faint idea of its remarkable 
character. 

No Protection at Home. 

And yet some—not many, but a few 
id protest—not against protection 
of our citizens, but the lack of it at 
home. They protested, and, what is 
more, they have kept right on protest¬ 
ing, and will continue to do so until 
this great nation’s horrible inconsist¬ 
encies which these foreign incidents 
so glaringly reflect are entirely elimi¬ 
nated. Caief among the protestants 
is the Constituion League. This 
meeting is a bit of evidence to that 
effect. 

And what are we protesting against? 
What are our griveances? Why do 
we disturb the public peace? What is 
it all about? What do we want? 

Well, first, we want information. We 
want to be informed on several vital 
points. We want to know, for exam¬ 
ple, why it is that the kind of pro¬ 
tection which all want to see extend¬ 
ed to our citizens abroad cannot be 
obtained for domestic use; why it is 
that American citizens can not be safe¬ 
guarded as well in Aemrica as in Af¬ 


rica; why it is actually safer today to 
be a full-fledged American citizen 
among the semi-civilized hordes of 
Morocco than it is to be an American 
citizen in the fullest sense of the term 
down in the State of Mississippi. (Ap¬ 
plause.) 

Just Want to Know. 

Again, we want to know why it is 
that a subject of the Sultan, a Jew, a 
Greek, or an Armenian, after becom¬ 
ing a € citizen of this Republic, but 
whose naturalization is not recognized 
by the Turkish government, can go 
back to Turkey and become politically 
active against the powers that be 
there, with actually less danger than 
a native-born American citizen can ex¬ 
ercise his constitutional rights in 
Louisiana. (Applause.) 

We want to know why the whole 
power of this nation can be so easily 
invoked to rescue from Macedonian 
captivity one worthy American mis¬ 
sionary of the Cross, and yet cannot 
be made available for the relief of 
hundreds, if not thousands of her fel¬ 
low-citizens who are today, according 
to the official records, held in peon¬ 
age—that is, actual physical slavery— 
right here in the United States and 
hundreds, if not thousands, more are, 
without trial by the properly consti¬ 
tuted judicial tribunals of the land, 
treated as beasts of the field in the 
chain gangs and prison pens of the 
South. (Applause.) 

» Massacre of Chinese Recalled. 

Recall the massacre of the Chinese 
at Green River and on the Pacific 
Coast some years previously, and you 
will recollect the prompt measures 
taken by the government for their pro¬ 
tection and the pnuishment of the mur¬ 
derers. Neither state rights nor state 
constitutions, lawful or unlawful, were 
permitted to stand in the way when 
foreign governments began to ask hard 
questions. Why should they be al¬ 
lowed to stand as a shield for the 
protection of the vilest crimes, the 
most horrible atrocities upon Ameri¬ 
can citizens that had ever disgraced 
the Anglo-Saxon or any other race? 
(Applause.) 

These things shame us at home and 
abroad. How can an American citizen 
express his hatred of Russian tyranny 
or Turkisfi oppression of Boxer ex¬ 
cesses when he is told to his face that 
we are on all fours with the bestial 
Kurds, for, after all, a Georgia lynch¬ 
ing bee has little to learn from the 
horrors of Odessa or Baku. (Applause.) 

My friends, an end must be made to 
these atrocities. The hour for a new 
departure has struck. In this time, 
when the nation’s conscience is awak¬ 
ening, let us not lose sight of this gi¬ 
gantic wrong, which is not eclipsed 
for an instant by all the insurance 


scandals and political graft ,the rail¬ 
road rebates and monopoly’s triumphs 
that may have been disclosed by in¬ 
telligent, relentless inquiry. (Ap¬ 
plause.) 

“Jim Crow” and Its Abuses. 

All the negro schools and colleges 
of the Southern States have never 
been able to prevent the enactment of 
one disfranchisement statute nor pre¬ 
vented the steady curtailment of the 
Afro-American’s rights and privileges. 
“Jim Crow” legislation has kept pace 
with the beneficent results of the 
Slater and Peabody funds. 

It is proper to add that before tak¬ 
ing the course which this meeting 
marks tonight, that of appealing to 
you, the plain people, the final court 
of all appeals, we had also tried the 
judicial remedy. We have been to 
the courts. Yes, we went, and we 
came away again, unremedied in a sin¬ 
gle grievance. We have been and are 
now carrying cases right up to that 
faithful old ally of the slaveholding 
fraternity, known as the United Slates 
Supreme Court, and have been told 
to go to—Congress. We have gore to 
Congress, and Congress has told us 
to go to the Courts, or to Coventry, 
or anywhere autside its precincts. 
(Laughter and applause.) 

Dr. Du Bois. 

That “Let Alone” Policy. 

Again In the 40's men said: At least 
slavery cannot expand—it is bottled 
up, a local question; “let the South 
alone.” And then it awoke to find 
slavery bursting into Mexico sweep¬ 
ing over the West, stretching its hands 
toward Cuba and threatening the 
North. Here again toaay is a ques 
tion of national importance. It is not 
a mere local question—nothing is local 
to Maine which threatens the very 
government under which California 
rests; nothing is local to New York 
which is uprooting the political and 
industrial system of Alabama. The 
North cannot stand idly by and let any 
state in the nation carelessly under¬ 
mine the very foundation of popular 
government; something must be done, 
and it must be done now. 

“Do it now, is the cry for those who 
would save democracy in America. 

What can be done? 

Plain Answers to Plain Questions. 

Two things can be done. First, if 
the South insists, despite the letter 
and spirit of the constituion, in deny¬ 
ing to a third of its population, a voice 
in its government, the country has a 
perfect right to say, You shall not en¬ 
joy in the national councils an influ¬ 
ence based on the very persons whose 
political rights you are withholding. 












s 


THE LIBERATOR. 


If they are to he voiceless in this gov¬ 
ernment, you at least have no right 
to speak for them. 

This is no permanent settlement of 
the matter—it is a temporary stay of 
proceedings—it is keeping the harm¬ 
ful influence of oligarchical despotism 
out of the councils of the nation until 
such time as the Fifteenth Amendment 
is respected throughout the land. 

A Negative Rebuke. 

Neither is this punishment—it is 
self defense. It is the simple, cold 
logic of a nation striving to preserve 
Us ancient form of government. If 
the voters of New York should re¬ 
move South they would have ten 
times the political power they have 
here, because they would not only 
cast their own votes, but mine too. 
Now, I prefer to cast my own vote, 
and if I cannot cast it I object to 
any man’s -casting it for me. I’d 
rather be disfranchised than give Gov¬ 
ernor Vardanian my proxy. 

Reduction of representation alone 
then will not- settle the Southern 
problem; eventually every Americau 
citizen, white or black, must cast an 
imtrammeled vote. Meantime reduc¬ 
tion of representation is a temporary 
measure, to save the country from the 
immense danger of a rotten borough 
system. To accomplish this ultimate 
aid tlje second and complementary 
measure must be a determined effort 
to stamp out popular ignorance in the 
South. 

Ignorance Not Sole Cause. 

Ignorance is not the sole cause of 
evil in the South, nor will the uni¬ 
versal ability to read and write usher 
the millennium into Mississippi; but 
ii is a certain thing that you cannot 
expect in a community where the per¬ 
centage of absolute ignorance is as 
great as it is in the South, you cannot 
expect popular intelligence wise 
enough to foresee the dangers of race 
prejudice, caste proscription, peonage 
and mob violence. Ignorance must be 
stamped out in the South by federal 
aid to common school training distrib¬ 
uted among the States according to il¬ 
literacy and between the races accord¬ 
ing to school population. In this pro¬ 
gram e of Southern reform—temporary 
reduction of representation and nation¬ 
al aid to education—there is nothing 
revolutionary or vindictive. 

The Righteous Demands. 

They are strong measures, but they 
are meant to cope with a strong and 
growing evil, and they do not go a 
step beyond the righteous demands of 
the situation. 

If you do not strike at this subver¬ 
sion of republican government thus 
energetically and decisively, believe 
me, my friends, you will face an in¬ 


finitely more sinister problem tomor¬ 
row than you are facing today. The 
forces- .that are gathering and girding 
themselves in the land to crush the 
black man helpless to the earth are 
growing in strength daily. Demagogues 
and charlatans are rising to lead t;hem. 
This is the time for the nation to 
speak for that better conscience of 
the South which is today so prisoned 
as to be almost unable to speak for 
itself.” 


BISHOP TURNER'S DENIAL. 

Atlanta, Feb. 24.—In today’s Consti¬ 
tution Bishop H. M. Turner denies that 
at the Macon conference he referred to 
the United States flag as “a dirty and 
contemptible rag.” Extracts from his 
lengthy letter to the Constitution fol¬ 
lows: 

“Much has been said of late, and 
even telegraphed over the country, to 
the effect that I called the flag of the 
nation a dirty and contemptible rag. 
I beg to say that I did no such thing. 
I have traveled from one end of this 
ration to the other, and from one side 
to the other, and I know all about its 
territory and itB vast resources. I 
have seen how the flag is honored and 
respected in foreign nations and on 
the oceans, and for me to make such 
a statement as that alleged would be 
to proclaim myself the fool of fools. 
But in a speech at our equal rights 
convention at Macon, criticising the 
lethargy of my race for not exercis¬ 
ing the right of petition, and protest 
to the Governor, Legislature, Congress 
and the President, I did say that there 
was not a star in the flag that the Ne¬ 
gro could claim or that recognized the 
civil liberty and unconditional man¬ 
hood any more than if it was a dirty 
rag. I am sorry everything I said was 
not published. I did say that there 
is more color babble in the United 
States than in hell itself; that color 
is unknown there; that men go there 
on account of crime and vicious 
lives; but that in the United States 
everybody’s- value or non-value de¬ 
pends on color.” 


THAT SPRINGFIELD MOB. 

The mob is composed of the worst 
element in the city. Police Prosecutor 
John M. Cole says that of some sixty 
ringleaders of the mob identified by 
the police all were police characters, 
while of the fifty or more people 
burned out in the jungles not one had 
been known to have been in the po¬ 
lice court in recent years. Two Afro- 
American women only have been in¬ 
jured by jumping out of windows, and 
there is very little damage done to 
property owned by our people. The 
affair has- been fearfully exaggerated 
in the dispatches to the daily papers o 


the country. The mob has, however, 
destroyed thousands of dollars worth 
of property owned by white people. 
Afro-Americans have not been stoned, 
beaten, etc.—Cleveland Gazette. 


POLITICAL SLAVERY THE FORE¬ 
RUNNER OF PHYSICAL 
SLAVERY. 

For almost forty years the Afro- 
American voters have voted almost 
solidly the Republican ticket without 
regard to issues or candidates. As 
a race his party loyalty is without a 
parallel in this country. And the treat¬ 
ment the Afro-Americans are receiv¬ 
ing is without a parallel. Blind parti¬ 
sanship leads to political slavery, and 
political slavery leads to physical 
slavery. With the exception of eight 
years the Republican party has been 
in power ever since the Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans became voters, some 36 years 
ago, and yet they have been disfran¬ 
chised in the South in violation of the 
Constitutional Amendments, taxed 
without representation and denied a 
voice in the party councils of the 
North. In view of the fact that with¬ 
out the Afro-American vote of the 
North and West, the Republican party 
could not retain its power in the na¬ 
tion, his total lack of voice and con¬ 
sideration in the party council presents 
a case of political serfdom that has no 
parallel. He has the balance of pow¬ 
er; with organization and the proper 
marshaling of his forces he could make 
the Congress Republican or Democrat¬ 
ic, and thereby influence the legisla¬ 
tion of the country. He could make 
his influence felt in the appointment 
of Supreme Court and District Judges, 
to the end that the constitution be hon¬ 
estly enterpreted and all class* legisla¬ 
tion killed. He would smash the in¬ 
iquitous jim crow cars into smither¬ 
eens and send mobs to the gallows or 
the pen. He would set free the half 
a million black peons in the South, 
his sons would be admitted into the 
naval and military academies and 
trained to whip the enemies of the 
country, whether foreign or domestic. 

When the Afro-American discovers 
his political power and decides to use 
it, his emancipation from the evils 
that now beset him will have been 
realized. Until then, no matter what 
party is in power, he will he legislated 
against, mobbed, forced to ride in jim 
crow cars, be at the caprice of 
mobs and hoodlums, taxed without 
representation and voted without con¬ 
sideration. 

Surely blind “partisan” Sampson 
has not discovered that his hair has 
grown long. 

What would the Socialist party do 
with the Afro-American’s political 
power? Would its members be poliu- 
fcal outcasts and beggars?

BISHOP TURNER AND THE FLAG. 

Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish Bishop Turner’s denial of the 
“dirty rag” reference to the American 
flag that has been so generously her¬ 
alded over the country. The agents 
of the Associated Press misquoted 
the Bishop perhaps to create more 
mean sentiments in this country 
against Afro-Americans. The Bishop 
did say: “There is not a star in the 
flag that the Negro can claim or that 
recognized his civil liberty and un¬ 
conditional manhood any more than if 
it was a dirty rag." That there are 
hundreds of thousands of Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans who entertain the same view is 
due to the contempt with which they 
see the constitution and flag regarded 
by the South with respect to the rec¬ 
ognition of their rights. The Federal 
constitution guarantees every citizen 
beneath the flag the right of trial by 
a jury of his peers when charged with 
crime. But what does this guarantee 
amount to if the alleged criminal is 
black and the offense is a serious one? 


Under the flag the Afro-Americans in 
nearly every Southern State have been 
disfranchised. As a result of this dis¬ 
franchisement, there are today under 
the flag thousands and thousands of 
hopeless black peons. Under the flag 
Afro-Americans are each day deprived 
of life, liberty and property without 
due process of law. Afro-Americans 
are legislated against jim-crowed and 
systematically ostracised, with the 
knowledge and connivance of the gov¬ 
ernment. So far as the flag relates 
to the Afro-American as a man and a 
citizen, it has been treated as a dirty 
rag by the white people of the South. 
Under the flag they have disfranchised 
the citizens of color in violation of the 
Federal constitution and of the pledges 
made by the States to get back into 
the Union after their failure to destroy 
It. Under the flag the South makes 
the Afro-American pay taxes without 
representation, the right of trial by 
jury suspended, and that of the mob 
set up. To Mrs. Hobart, the innocent 
colored woman burned at the stake in 
Mississippi by a white mob, the flag 
was no more than the mud-stained 
garments that she wore. What was 
the flag to the thousands of Afro-Amer¬ 
icans that have been lynched beneath 
it? What is the flag to the half a 
million black peons in the South to¬ 
day? What is a flag to a people it 
does not protect? For trying to de¬ 
stroy the flag, the late Gen. Wheeler 
was honored. For pleading for jus¬ 
tice, Bishop Turner is called a traitor. 


Is Simpson, the Slayer of Elton, Guilty 
of Murder? 

The case of Henry Simpson, colored 
charged with murdering Harry Elton! 
white, is attracting considerable at¬ 
tention among the Afro-Americans, ow¬ 
ing to the causes leading to the kill¬ 
ing. The facts in the case are these: 
Simpson, who is a railroad porter, 
went to the home of John Brooks, 
a former railroad porter, to spend a 
few hours, as is the custom of him¬ 
self and railroad porters. While thpre 
Harry Elton visited the place, looking 
for Mrs. Newman, a married white 
woman, whose affections he had stol¬ 
en from her husband, and kept them 
vi et armis. Elton went to the 
Brooks home in search of Mrs. New¬ 
man, because she accompanied by her 
husband, had now and then been call¬ 
ers there. Failing to find Mrs. New¬ 
man, who he believed was hiding from 
him, he attacked and shot. Simpson 
knocked him down the steps. In the 
struggle Simpson saved his own life 
hv wrenching the pistol from Elton. 
Seeing his gun in the hands of the 
man he had shot, Elton ran, Simpson 
fired at him, the bullet taking effect 
in Elton’s body, causing his death. 


Is not this what any man would 
have done under like circumstances? 
Simpson, did not know Elton, and to 
shoot him under the circumstances 
seems to have been a natural conse¬ 
quence. Furthermore it led to the 
capture of a bad man and would-be 
murderer. 

Reverse the case. Suppose the 
Brookses were white and Simpson was 
white, and Elton and the Newman 
woman were negroes, would Simpson 
be lying in jail awaiting trial for kill¬ 
ing the lustful black brute who dared 
to assault him with a pistol in a white 
man’s house? Would not the coro¬ 
ner’s jury have exonerated him as it 
did the white bully and murderer who 
murdered Godfrey a few months ago 
without provocation? Would not all 
of the daily papers have made him a 
hero? But no matter what a white 
man is while living, he becomes a 
saint if killed by a negro, regardless 
of the causes leading to the killing. 

This man who had assaulted New¬ 
man and took his wife, was on the 
evening he received his death wound, 
a missionary armed with a pistol try¬ 
ing to rescue her from the deadly 
paths of sin. Truly, “the wages of sin 
is death.” 


Something Wrong With the Coroner's 
Office. 

When an Afro-American is the vic¬ 
tim of a white man’s club or a white 
man is the victim of an Afro-Ameri¬ 
can’s bullet, something seems to go 
wrong at the coroner's office. Its abil¬ 
ity to deliberate with ends of justice 
in view seem to lose its equilibrium. 
Take the Godfrey case, for instance: 
Godfrey was attacked by a drunken 
white man on Labor Day last, Godfrey 
being a labor unionist. After a fierce 
rough-and-tumble fight, Godfrey came 
off victorious, and, almost exhausted, 
started to walk away, when a white 
bully who had nothing to do with the 
fight, knocked him down, killing him. 
The coroner’s jury exonerated the 
murderer, claiming that Godfrey’s 
death was caused by the fall, the mur¬ 
derer who knocked him down had 
nothing to do with the fall. Godfrey 
was a citizen and taxpayer of the city, 
and left $10,000 worth of real estate. 
The man who killed him was a non¬ 
resident, having nothing but his hat 
and a thirst for committing crime. 
There is something wrong in the cor¬ 
oner’s office. It is cheapening the 
Afro-Americans’ lives. 

In our next edition this whole mat¬ 
ter will be laid before the colored 
voters. There is something wrong.

THE PRESIDENT'S RATE BILL 
IS TURNED OVER TO HIS 
FRIEND TILLMAN. 

The delivery of the President's Rail¬ 
road Rate Bill to Senator Tillman by 
the Republican Senators is without a 
precedent, in view of the fact that 
Tillman belongs to the minority party 
and all along has been a bitter tra- 
ducer of the President. The President 
must certainly feel keenly his humilia¬ 
tion. Tillman is a man without char¬ 
acter or influence, and the turning of 
the President’s pet measure over to 
him was thought by the Republican 
Senators to be the best way to show 
the President the estimation in which 
he and his one-man policy are held by 
the members of his party in the Sen¬ 
ate. Judging by his policy, the Presi¬ 
dent since his election has forgotten 
both party and platform. The Presi¬ 
dent’s popularity with the country 
will pull him through, but he will 
leave seas of trouble for his party. 
So far as the Afro-American is con¬ 
cerned, the nullifiers have captured 
the President and silenced him. 


THE OHIO OUTRAGE. 

The Cleveland (Ohio) Gazette says 
the reports of the Springfield mob 
have been greatly exaggerated. In 
charity to the great State of Ohio let 
us hope that this is true. But the fact 
remains, to the disgrace of that State, 
that a gang of hoodlums did maltreat 


A RECEPTION TO MAJ. ALLENS- 
WORTH. 

We are in receipt of an invitation 
from the Southern California Real Es¬ 
tate and Investment Company of Los 
Angeles to a reception on Monday 
evening, April 9th, at Wesley Chapel 
M. E. Church, in honor Ol Major Allen 
Allensworth, who will be retired from 
active service in the United States 
army with the rank of Lieutenant- 
Colonel. This reception is looked for¬ 
ward to with great interest by the col¬ 
ored people, and will doubtless be a 
notable affair, as the Major is very 
popular, being the business manager 
of the above named real estate com¬ 
pany, and the first colored man to re¬ 
tire from the army with the rank of 
Lieutenant-Colonel. 


Mr. Harry Mitchell t the well-known 
and popular real estate man of the 
Furlong Tract, has opened a real es¬ 
tate office in the Laughlin Block, room 
303. 


Attorney C. S. Darden has opened 
offices in the Bryson Block and will do 
a general insurance, brokerage and 
real estate business. 


Dr. John A. Summerville, the popu¬ 
lar young dentist, is a baritone of 
Wesley M. E. church choir. The doc 
tor is a man of splendid physique, 
possessing a rich voice. His presence 
adds dignity to that excelelnt group 
of singers. It is wonderful how little 


the world heeds a man's death or res¬ 
ignation. It's like dropping a pebble 
in the rolling tide. 


Since the advent of that little dim* 
pled darling into the home of Dr. and 
Mrs. Sykes, to increase its sunlight 
and Joy, the doctor has thrown away 
his carriage and horses and bought 
an automobile. If he will keep the 
whole business up for a few years he 
will have to build a warehouse. 

We congratulate the doctor and his 
whole family. May they ever have 
and enjoy all of the good things of 
life.

Mr. R. C. Owens will soon erect a 
business block on the lot he purchased 
from the A. M. E. Zion congregation. 
The property is very valuable, and 
when the building is completed it will 
constitute a fortune in itself.

law-abiding blacks and reduce their 
homes to ashes, while the troops 
looked on. That something is radi¬ 
cally wrong with the good white peo¬ 
ple of Springfield, is shown by their 
toleration of the mob, even for six 
hours. The claim that the mob was 
composed of roughs, police court char¬ 
acters and boys does not relieve the 
good citizens of the responsibility for 
the outrages. There is perhaps a grain 
of comfort in the fact that Northern 
mobs are made up of hoodlums, 
crooks and loafers. In the South they 
are composed of "our best citizens.** 
The Afro-Americans of Springfield 
who suffered at the hands of the mob 
were not of the criminal class, but 
law-abiding men and women who have 
no police court records. That is what 
the chief of police said. While the 
Afro-Americans were fleeing from 
their burning homes, pursued by the 
mob, the militia stood by enjoying "the 
fun." How long the Afro-Americans 
are going to put up with this kind of 
"fun” remains to be seen. The crack 
of the black man's rifle may sometime 
add to the "fun. ,f It ought to, at 
least.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT JOINED 
THE NEGRO HATERS. 

Discussing the Bishop Turner flag 
episode, the Southwestern Christian 
Advocate says: 1 

“The Bishop is neither a fool nor a 
crank, as some people pretend to be¬ 
lieve.. He sees the situation as it is, 
and is brave enough to characterize 
it. Under the flag the Negro, a loyal 
citizen, has no rights which a white 
man is bound to respect, and the Pres¬ 
ident has joined himself to the race 
oppressors, and agreed to be silent on 
the South’s inhuman treatment of the 
Negro. The Roosevelt that appointed 
and stood by Dr. Crumm does not ex¬ 
ist now. He is dead. Laugh at Bish¬ 
op Turner if you will, but he tells the 
truth when he says the flag does not 
protect or respect the Negro citizen.”

THE GRIM REAPER REAPS. 

Since our last the grim old Reaper 
has taken over the way, Messrs. Win. 
Dodson, R. H. Slaton, Bud Rice, A. Mc¬ 
Clendon, Mrs. Francis Hill and Miss 
Helen Wright. Mr. Dodson was a hod- 
carrier occupying a humble place in 
the community, but no one ever car¬ 
ries to his daily tasks a bigger or 
kindlier or lighter heart. Undiscover¬ 
ed, from the cradle to the grave, he 
went about doing good. He was a 
kind and affectionate husband, and fa¬ 
ther and a loyal friend. Mr. Slaton 
was an old, well-known and popular 
citizen. 

Their funerals were largely attend¬ 
ed, the Moore and Burnette Company 
having charge.
