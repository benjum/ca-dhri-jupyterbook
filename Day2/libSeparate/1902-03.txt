MRS. W. L. GRAVES. 

The attack Mrs. Graves made upon 
the good name of the whole negro race 
before the “Friday Morning Club” was 
the most bitter ever witnessed in this 
city. What pleasure she can find in 
trying to stir up strife between the 
races in this section is past finding 
out. In her tirade of abuse there is 
not a single statement that can be 
supported by facts. Her statement that 
crime is on the increase among the 
negroes is equally true of the white 
race. She charges the negro with po¬ 
litical corruption. If the negro sold 
his vote who bought it? In this case 
what is the difference between the 
buyer and seller? If the negro’s vote 
was for sale what caused the election 
riots in the South that followed the 
suppression of the Ku Klux Klan? It 
is certain the negro did not sell his 
vote then. Since 1875 he has had no 
vote to sell. She charges the negro 
with being immoral and cites the mu¬ 
latto population as a proof. Will 
some of the negro haters inform us 
how these mulattoes came here? Why 
are all the mulattoes born in the 
South? Why is it that the number of 
mulatto children born in the South 
now are not so large as it was during 
the days of slavery? Did the fathers of 
these mulattoes elevate or lower the 
moral status of the mothers of these 
mulattoes? This howl that fe contin¬ 
ually coming up from the South 
about “social equality, intermarriage,” 
etc., naturally suggests these ques¬ 
tions to those who are acquainted with 
the heavy mulatto population of that 
section. 

Mr. James M. Vena has well said 
“Equality of opportunity is all that is 
desired by us. Social equality will 
take care of itself.” Ah, that is the 
rub!

MAYOR SNYDER. 

The man of the people and for the 
people is Mayor Snyder. In refusing 
to sign the blanket franchise that was 
unlawfully sold to the Huntington- 
Hellman syndicate he exhibited a 
firmness and courage that has won for 
him the lasting gratitude of his fellow 
citizens regardless of political affilia¬ 
tion. The people realize now more 
than ever that they made no mistake 
in electing him over the united oppo¬ 
sition of the daily papers of the city. 
By their laudation of our Spartan 
mayor these papers admit that they 
were saved in spite of themselves. 
Had the mayor been defeated in the 


last election the people would have 
lost this contest and thirteen miles of 
our streets would have been turned in¬ 
to highways for hauling freight and the 
value of millions of dollars worth of 
property would have been almost per¬ 
manently decreased. The flight this 
journal made for the mayor was not in 
vain. We felt then that we were mak¬ 
ing the peoples* fight. Now we know 
it. Mayor Snyder has come fully up 
to our estimate of him. He is indeed 
the peoples’ man and hundreds of re¬ 
publicans have already signified their 
intention of voting for him if he re¬ 
ceives the democratic nomination for 
governor next summer. If he is nom¬ 
inated the democratic party will enter 
the next campaign with more than a 
fighting chance.

THE LIBERATOR. 



DOCTOR BOWERS. 

The Creation of the Negro 
Discussed. 


LETTER FROM DR. BOWERS. 

Editor Liberator: Referring to my 
article in the Ram’s Horn of Decem¬ 
ber 7th, on the recent origin of man, 
you do me an injustice. You head 
your article “Dr. Stephen Bowers Does 
Not Believe the Bible Story of the 
Creation of Man.” You seen to infer 
thsi from my declaration that there 
may have been different centers of 
creation; that the Bible gives us a his¬ 
tory of the Adamic pair and their de- 
cendents from which the Saviour of 
the world was to spring; and that it 
was my belief that the African race 
began its existence previous to that 
of the white race. 

I base this belief on two' or three 
particulars. Some of U.e oldest monu¬ 
ments of Egypt, dating back several 
thousand years from our time, and 
within at least 2000 years of the crea¬ 
tion of Adam, contain pictures of Afri¬ 


cans which are exactly typical of the 
negro of the jungles of Africa today. 
He has a n ck skin, crisp hair, re¬ 
ceding forehead, flattened nose, tu- 
maceous lips, prognathous jaws, long 
femers (and doubtless oblique pelvis, 
and all ’he other characteristics that 
differentiate the two races) exactly as 
the typical African of the present time. 
Now, my contention is that as in the 
last, probably, 6000 years there has 
been no apparent change in the Afri¬ 
can of pure blood, it is not at all prob¬ 
able there was in the preceding 2000 
years. Hence the African could not 
have sprung from the wh'te race. 

The Hebrew word Adamah, from 
which the word Adam is derived, 
means red or reddish, a color that 
characterizes what is termed the 
“white race.” The Indian is not the 
“red man,” hut is copper-colored, as 
are all mongoloids; but the white man 
is the red man, properly speaking. He 
still retains the color in which he was 
created, and doubtless the African does 
also. No disgrace can be attached to 


the color of the skin, for we are ex¬ 
actly as God created us, and He makes 
no mistakes. 

You say; “The learned doctor does 
not believe the Scriptural declaration 
that God created all men of one flesh.” 
There is no such declaration in the 
Bible, to my knowledge. Paul said: 
“And hath made of one blood all na¬ 
tions of men to dwell on the face of 
the earth,” etc. But he does not say 
that they all descended from the same 
pair. The biologist will tell you that 
the blood corpuscles in man differ 
from that of the lower animals, but 
the blood of all human races seem to 
be of the same kind. It would, there¬ 
fore, be proper to say, “And hath made 
of one kind of blood all nations,” etc. 

The relation between the races is 
that they are all human beings regard¬ 
less of the colors of their skins; they 
have the same responsibility to their 
Creator and they Have the same des¬ 
tiny. God is no respector of persons, 
and looks on the heart, not on the 
color of the skin. The fact that there 
may have been different centers of 
creation “does not affect the oneness 
or nature nor the general des¬ 

tiny of man.” The first chapters of 
Genesis intimate that there were peo¬ 
ple living upon this earth when the 
Adamic pair were created. Whether 
white, black or copper-colored we have 
no positive means of knowing. 

Permit me to say in conclusion that 
after long study of the Bible story of 
creation in the light of science, phil- 
sophy and- critical exeges s, I most cor¬ 
dially believe it; and not only the 
creation story but every declaration 
found within that Sacred Book. It is 
God’s volume to man, of every race 
and color, to aid him in extricating 
himself from the difficulties in which 
his fail has placed him, and to find his 
way to a better life. 

STEPHEN BOWERS. 

Los Angeles, Dec. 31, 1901. 


Elsewhere in these columns* will be 
found an interesting letter from Doctor 
Bowers, in reply to a criticism in this 
journal of his “Ram’s Horn” article on 
the “Recent Origin of Man,” in which 
the learned doctor declares it to be his 
belief “That the negro is an independ¬ 
ent creation.” In his attempt to ex¬ 
tricate himself the doctor seems to have

gotten into a worse tangle. He no 
longer “delves in the solitary rocks” 
of California, but has carried the war 
into Africa and in headlong dash to 
the pyramids of Egypt he left his rear 
to the mercy of his foes. 

Genesis 3:20 says, “And Adam called, 
his wife’s name Eve because she was 
the mother of all living.” Again 
Genesis 7:21 and 22, “And all flesh died 
that moved upon the earth, both of 
fowl, and of cattle, and of beast and 
of every creeping thing that creepeth 
upon the earth, and every man.” “All 
in whose nostrils was the breath of 
life, of all was in the dry land, died.” 

Now, if the negro is an independent 
creation and his creation antedates 
that of Adam he must have been ex¬ 
tinct when “Adam named his wife Eve 
because she was the mother of all liv¬ 
ing.” According to Genesis 7:13 there 
were only eight persons saved in the 
ark. Now, if this is true, where was 
the negro? Did God have two creations 
of the negro, one before Adam and the 
other after the flood? We can neither 
deny or verify statements found in the 
Bible by studying pictures carved on 
monuments erected by forgotten Egyp¬ 
tians. A study of those prodigious 
monuments as they relate to the 
crumbled power of ancient Egypt 
and demonstrate the mutability of hu¬ 
man power and greatness, they teach 
an important lesson. They prove that 
power and oppression cannot perpetu¬ 
ate the memory of nations or individ¬ 
uals. Immutability from the ravages 
of time and oblivion can be secured, 
not by doubting the Scriptures, but by 
following their precepts. The master 
and slave lie clown together in the 
dust of oblivion and succeeding genera¬ 
tions gaze with awe upon the monu¬ 
ments erected by the slave to perpetu¬ 
ate the memory of the master without 
knowing master from slave.

OUR FRIENDS ARE PASSING AWAY. 

Since the first of the year we have re¬ 
ceived an unusually long list of names 
of friends who have crossed the great 
divide. Among those near and dear to 
us who have crossed the border land 
recently the names of onr brother, Mr. 
S. J. Edmonds, and Messrs. James R. 
and Jefferson L.Edmonds,the latter sons 
of our former master,are on the list. 
We knew them all to love them and in¬ 
stead of -one, w T 0 seem to have lost three 
brothers. In the early seventies, 
when we were struggling to get the 
rudiments of an education at Crawford- 
ville, Miss., the two last named ren¬ 
dered us every assistance possible. The 
latter, Mr. Jefferson L. Edmonds often 
furnished clothing and money to help 
us through a school term. Our mother 
nursed him and loved to the day of her 
death as a mother loves her son. He 
was a noble man that knew not an 
enemy, for he had none. With our 
mother’s brother as a body servant, 
he followed the fortunes of Gen. Robt. 
E. Lee from the formation of his army 
to the battle of Gettysburg, where 
among the great heaps of the slain he 
was left for dead. The lives if these 
dear ones were such that death simply 
summoned them from labor to rest. 
Indeed, there are so few of the good 
men and women left whose lives blest 
our youth that a thought of them 
makes us feel alone, although in the 
midst of the rushing multitude of to¬ 
day. 

They now rest in peace. 


MR. FRANK WALKER. 


The fight Mr. Walker has made for 
the people in the franchise contest has 
won for him their lasting gratitude. 
The freight carrying clause in the 
franchise was juggled through the 
council in his absence. While he is 
opposed to the freight carrying clause, 
he contends that the city ought to 
have one million dollars for it if it 
must he incorporated into the fran¬ 
chise. He he has proved himself in 
every way worthy of the confidence Im¬ 
posed in him by the voters in his ward. 
The people of the city will call him to 
higher duties.

BEN TILLMAN AGAIN. 


Just as we expected, Ben Tillman, 
who has been going over the country 
preaching the gospel of murder and 
hate and the right of white cut-throats 
like himself to murder and rob negroes, 
has commenced to assault white men. 
It is but natural that he should regard 
whtie men as cowards and hypocrites, 
who have silently submitted to his 
bullyism for the past six years. He has 
stood in the senate and boasted of liav 
ing killed “niggers” and stuffed bal¬ 
lot boxes, and violated the constitution 
and laws with impunity, without even 
a protest from those who claimed to 
represent law and order. Of course, 
it was negroes whom he and his gang- 
had murdered and robbed, but the men 
who will murder and rob negroes will 
murder and rob white men whenever 
they deem it necessary. Mr. Tillman, 
whose incendiary utterances received 
the applause of northern audiences, is 
now making white men the victims of 


his lawless brutality. Tillman’s suc¬ 
cess as a self-confessed murderer and 
peace breaker has induced a number 
of white women to take the stump to 
encourage burning at the stake on sus¬ 
picion, mob murder, anarchy nullifica¬ 
tion and hell. If the republican major¬ 
ity in the senate possessed half the 
backbone that Tillman possesses he 
would hae been expelled from the sen¬ 
ate long ago. The end is not yet. Till¬ 
man will remain in the senate. 
Whither is this Christian nation drift¬ 
ing? 

----—o-- 

THE SOLID SIX. 

Of the “solid six” it may be said of 
several of them that “The places that 
know them now will in a short time 
know them no more forever.” The 
gentleman from the Sixth ward is al¬ 
ready preparing to retire to the 
shades of a private life. Some of his 
constiuents seem to think that he can 
best serve the interests of his ward in 
the latter capacity. It is thought that 
the two railroad attorneys represent¬ 
ing the Eighth and Ninth wards will 
be able to stem the tide, as these wards 
are well supplied with “gin mills.” 
But these genettemen will not attempt 
to widen their political territory; to do 
this would be fatal. They will there¬ 
fore settle down to practical ward heel¬ 
ing. The Seventh ward is represented 
by a blacksmith, who, while his con¬ 
stituents are divided as to his success 
as a councilman, their unanimous ver¬ 
dict is that he is a good blacksmith. 
Now, when he returns next January to 
make music on his anvil he will do so 
with the consciousness that the voters 
in his ward will enjoy it better than 
his services as councilman. 

There are others who will be elected 
to stay home as soon as the voters get 
a hearing. 


Doctor Bowers says that “No dis¬ 
grace can be attached to the color of 
the skin, as we are exactly as God 
created us, and He makes no mistakes.” 
It behooves the doctor to be a little 
careful about such utterances, or Mrs. 
Burdette and Mrs. Lou V. Chapin will 
read him out of the white race. With 
them it seems that everything depends 
upon the color of the skin. As they 
see it, character cannot live under a 
dark skin. To have a soul the hide 
must he white. 


A CHANGE OF NAME. 

The Colored Business Men’s Asso¬ 
ciation will soon he incorporated under 
the name of The Los Angeles Business 
Men’s Association. As soon as the 
charter is obtained it will proceed to 
make business investments. The asso¬ 
ciation will incorporate with a capital 
stock of $10,000, divided into 1000 
shares of $10 each. The shares sold 
will mature in ten months. The asso¬ 
ciation has sixteen members, all men 
of character and standing in the com¬ 
munity, all of whom are earnest in their 
endeavor to stimulate business enter¬ 
prises among the race. 

Later, the capital stock of the Los 
Angeles Business Men’s Association 
has been increased to $25,000, divided 
into 1000 shares of $25 each.

During the year 1901, 136 persons 

were put to death by anarchists in this 
country. President McKinley was one 
of the victims. Six were burned at the 
stake. Although these murders were 
committed in broad daylight in the 
presence of men, women and children, 
only one anarchist, Czolgosc, paid the 
penalty for his crime of cold-blooded 
murder. The other victims were ne¬ 
groes, and public sentiment did not 
demand that their murderers he pun¬ 
ished. The mob has made a good 
start and will claim many victims be¬ 
fore the close of the year. 


MRS. JAMES M. VENA RL-PeIES. 

Mrs. Vena’s reply to Mrs. Graves 1 
wanton assault upon the good name of 
a whole race was simply masterly. It 
is unanswerable. Mrs. Graves’ attack 
upon the negros was made in the true 
Southern mob style, either in droves or 
behind closed doors. They never attack 
the negro in an open field. The meth¬ 
ods pursued against the negroes by a 
certain class of whites are not only 
cowardly, but contemptible. There* is 
no position too low for them to take, 
no statement too false for them to 
make.

MR. G. B. LEWIS, 

Vice-President of the Los Angeles Business Men’sAsociation. 
MR. G. B. LEWIS. 


Of the Los Angeles colored business 
men it can be said with truth that Mr. 
Lewis has made the most rapid pro¬ 
gress of them all. Five years ago he 
went into the employ of the Cass & 
Smurr Hardware Company to do gen¬ 
eral repair work. His previous experi¬ 
ence soon raised him in the estimation 
of the firm and his wages were in¬ 
creased from time to time. While thus 
employed he opened a repair shop in 
the rear of his place, 1332 Girard street, 
and did odd jobs for his neighbors dur¬ 
ing the evening. His ad. in the three 
colored' papers that circulate in the 
city—“G. B. Lewis, stove doctor; old 
stoves made new”—gave him as thor¬ 
ough introduction to the public. The 
patronage he gained by first class work 
soon made it necessary for him to re¬ 
sign his position with Cass & Smurr, 
so as to meet the demands of his cus¬ 
tomers. The company accepted his res¬ 
ignation with the understanding that 


he remain with it until he could train 
a young man to take his place. He 
had made himself a necessity to the 
firm and therefore could not leave till 
he educated a man to take his place. 
The selection of a successor being left 
to him, he selected Mr. Van C. Wil¬ 
liams, who is proving himself worthy 
of the confidence imposed in him. 
Forming a copartnership with Mr. 
Smith, also an employe of Cass & 
Smurr, they opened a stove and hard¬ 
ware house at 220 West Sixth street, 
under the firm name of Smith & Lewis. 
The business soon outgrew the place, 
compelling them to move to 611 South 
Broadway, their present quarters. 
They carry a $5000 stock, requiring 
three persons to handle the business. 
Their place of business is one of the 
neatest, best kept places of its kind on 
Broadway. Mr. Lewis has been a 
source of constant surprise to persons 
who call to order a stove or range, on 
inquiring for the proprietor finding 
that Mr. Lewis is one of them. 


The example Mr. Lewis has set and 
his success is worthy of emulation by 
the colored men who hold many pay¬ 
ing jobs in this city. It should he the 
ambition of every man who is compeled 
to work for others to conduct himself 
so as to some day be his own boss and 
fill a man’s place in his community. 
Instead of spending his wages in giv¬ 
ing lawn parties on rented lawns and 
having rented houses “tastefully dec¬ 
orated’' so as to shine (?) in the col¬ 
umns of some so-called newspaper as 
a social leader, he saved his earnings 
and is now doing business for himself. 
One successful business man is better 
than a hundred social leaders who are 
dependent upon others for employment. 
It has been said time and again if the 
negro hoped to oecoupy a man’s place 
in this country he must own a part of 
its wealth and he a part of its busi¬ 
ness. Playing the part of a buffoon 
during a political campaign will get 
him nothing higher than a spittoon job. 
Like many others, Mr. Lewis realizes 
this fact and is devoting his attention 
to the things that will make him one 
of the taxpayers and business promo¬ 
ters of this city. 


THE SOUTH AGAIN HEARD FROM. 

This time it is two young bloods at 
the Nebraska University who have 
almost gone mad because Booker T. 
Washington was invited to deliver the 
commencement address. They threat¬ 
ened to leave the university if the in¬ 
vitation is not withdrawn. It is to be 
hoped that the invitation will hold 
good. If these foolish fellows and all 
like them would commit suicide the 
cost of burying them would be a good 
investment. Their presence .in the 
country is a menace to its peace and 
dignity. When will the South cease to 
owe its prominence before the coun¬ 
try to its mobs and mouthings of its 
“nigger” haters? The fellow that has 
nothing to recommend him but the 
color of his hide is poor indeed. 


Mrs. R. A. Washington of 1427 New¬

Laws that Encourage Un¬ 
lawful Co-habitation. 

THE MISCEGENATION LAWS. 

The miscegenation laws of the South¬ 
ern states, which have been copied by- 
several of the northern and western 
states, enacted to prevent the legal in¬ 
ter-marriage of the white and black 
races, and known to shame as the mis¬ 
cegenation laws, have been productive 
of more crime against morality than 
is generally supposed. A study of 
these laws present some strange fea¬ 
tures. There is more mixing of the 
races in states where the law prohibits 
legal mixing than in states where 
there is no legal prohibition. The so- 
called “rape racket,” where the charge 
made against negroes is confined al¬ 
most wholly to those states having 
miscegenation laws. There are 30,000 
mulatto children born in this country 
every year;of course most of them have 
negro mothers and born outside of wed¬ 
lock. And an investigation will show 
further that nine-tenths of those ille¬ 
gitimate children are born where the 
miscegenation laws prevail. In states 
where the miscegenation laws are In 
vogue white men are never punished 
for living unlawfully with negro wo¬ 
men, and in such states negro women 
have no redress for assaults and insults 
perpetrated upon them by white men. 
There are excej^tions, but they are 
generally north of the Mason and 
Dixon line. Where the laws punish all 
despoilers of female virtue alike,regard¬ 
less of the color of the female, there 
is practically no illegal mixing of the 
races and no “rape racekt.” But where 
virtue is determined by the color of the 
skin, true reverence for it is lowered 
in both sexes,hence the illegal mixing 
Instead* of being dubbed as laws to pre¬ 
vent intermarriage they should be en¬ 
titled “Laws to encourage unlawful co¬ 
habitation between the races,” for that 
is what is being done by this flagrant 
class legislation. If this tiling is kept 
up for fifty or one hundred years what 
will he its effect upon the morality of 
the country? Laws that farce 30,000 
unfortunate children to be born outside 
of wedlock annually are a crime not 
only against civilization, but is 

also against virtue and human¬ 


ity. We do not and never have 
favored the inter-marriage of the races, 
but all right-minded decent people pre¬ 
fer marriage to adultery. We favor the 
enactment of national matrimonial 
laws that will encourage marriage and 
punish adultery. The moral purity of 
the nation demands it. Why were these 
miscegenation laws enacted in the 
first place? Were they necessary? Let’s 
see: The negro was brought to this 
country by force and held in abject 
slavery for 250 years, during which 
time it was unlawful for him to exer¬ 
cise any rights clue man. He could not 
even contract a legal marriage; there¬ 
fore had to raise his children outside 
of wedlock. He was ignoratn and 
poor because it was unlawful for him 
to be otherwise. This was his condi¬ 
tion at the close of the war that freed 
him. But no sooner was he freed, en¬ 
cumbered as he was with the ignor¬ 
ance, poverty and immorality that 
slavery had forced* upon him, than his 
former masters enacted laws to pre¬ 
vent him from inter-marrying with his 
sons and daughters. Was this neces¬ 
sary? Had slavery so weakened the 
white people that they were unable to 
reject offers of marriage from their 
slaves of yesterday? Already the coun¬ 
try is suffering a moral blight caused 
by our two codes of morals. Divorces, 
prostitution, suicides, insanity and 
crimes are increasing to an alarming 
extent. Either the virtue of all women 
will have to be protected or the moral 
standing of society in general will be 
lowered. 


THE COLOR LINE DRAWN. 

After considerable hair pulling those 
representing the majority in members 
but the minority in wealth' and intelli¬ 
gence of the woman’s clubs of the 
state, under the leadership of Mrs. 
Burdette, wife of a Pasadena minister 
of Chirst, have drawn the color line 
in the woman’s clubs. The color of 
the skin is now to be the test of wo¬ 
manhood. According to the.se ladies J 
idea of womanhood the possession of 
an ideal Christian character amounts 
to nothing if the skin is dark. This 
is another case of selling the birth¬ 
right for a mess of pottage. Tt is an¬ 
other case of casting pearls before the 
swine of southern color hate to win 
the friendship of the swine. After all, 
it is history repeating itself. The su¬ 
preme Court of the United States did 
the same thing when it handed down 
the Dred Scott decision. Congress 


passed the fugitive slave law for the 
same reason. To obtain the same end 
Daniel Webster cast himself down 
from the pinnacle of his fame my sup¬ 
porting that infamous law and died of 
a broken heart. To keep the negro 
down, to sink him beneath the level of 
brutes the supreme court prostituted its 
august authority; congress became the 
willing tool of those who trafficked 
in human flesh and female virtue, and 
Daniel Webster bartered his good 
name. These all died amid the evil 
they had done and the negro was freed 
by work his enemies did to prevent it. 
Thus the cause of justice goes right on 
• winning victories in spite of the tem¬ 
porary obstruction by misguided men 
and women. In a few short years,while 
the whites and blacks of this genera¬ 
tion are mingling together as common 
clay, their descendants will be work¬ 
ing shoulder to shoulder for the mutual 
advancement of all. When they read 
the pages of the history that is be¬ 
ing written today they will blush and 
wonder what manner of men some of 
their ancestors were, who, while claim¬ 
ing to be followers of Jesus Christ, 
working for the advancement of his 
kingdom among men, were going from 
place to place preaching the gospel of 
hate, sowing seeds of revolution, 
planting thistle where figs should have 
been planted, cultivating hate instead 
of love, war instead of peace. 

INTER-MARRIAGE OF THE RACES 
AGAIN. 

In connection with this woman’s 
club business the old worn out cry 
about inter-marriage of the races has 
been raised again. This old dodge is 
used whenever some friend of human¬ 
ity takes a stand for justice to all men 
regardless of color or condition. Now, 
the first-class white people of this 
country are giving themselves no 
trouble whatever about negroes marry¬ 
ing into their families, and first, the 
first class negroes are giving them¬ 
selves less concern than the latter class 
of whites. Every year there are born 
in the United States 30,000 mulato chil¬ 
dren. The fathers of these unfortunate 
children are white men and the moth¬ 
ers black women, not octoroons. 
Strange as it may seem, these good 
men and women who are so utterly op¬ 
posed to the mixing of the races are 
never heard to speak a word condemn¬ 
ing this crime against virtue and 
innocence. It is marriage that these 
good people oppose, not unlawful co¬ 
habitation. It is a crime against the 
white women, the black women and 
black men. But what can the black 
men do about it? They are not repre¬ 
sented in the legislative department of 
the Federal nor the state government 
in which- they live. They have no 
voice in making or executing the laws. 
Those who can lynch him with im¬ 
punity can make any use of his women 
they please. Thank God these unfor-

tunate conditions,!ike slavery that gave 
them birth, cannot last. American 
man and womanhood will yet assert it¬ 
self and Ben Tillman and his cohorts 
both male and female, will be driven 
to the rear. The negro does not fear 
the outcome. In the ranks of those 
who are leading this fight against the 
innocent and the weak there is not a 
single infidel. What an inconsistent 
gang we followers of Christ have to 
associate with! Surely the “wheat and 
tares” are growing together.
