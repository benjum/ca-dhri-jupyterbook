The Republican Party’s Ship 
on the Rocks 


Colonel Roosevelt's announce¬ 
ment that he will accept the Re¬ 
publican presidential nomination 
if tendered him, insures the defeat 
of President Taft either for renomi¬ 
nation, or for re-election at 
the polls. As things now stand it 
looks as if defeat will overtake the 
G. O. P. no matter who is the 
standard bearer. The party is 
hopelessly divided into bitter, hos¬ 
tile camps. Party principles have 
been sacrificed and the party— 
the former champion of manhood 
rights, has become through its 
present leaders, subservient to 
special interests. As a defender of 
the rights of men, the Republican 
party came into existence. As 
such, it became the rallying point 
of all lovers of justice and the hope 
of the oppressed the world over. 

Having abandoned those whom 
it was created to protect—the 
weak—and having become the sub¬ 
servient tool of the strong, the Re¬ 
publican party, rent with internal 
strife is drifting to its doom. 
Having allowed the Negro to be 
stripped of his constitutional rights 
and left to his fate because he is 
a Negro, the rights of certain 
white men are being abridged be¬ 
cause they are not millionaires. 

Where stands the Negro? 

In the coming presidential strug¬ 
gle it would be well if the Negro 
voters could occupy places as spec¬ 
tators and let the Republicans 
and Democrats settle it among 
themselves. It has become ex¬ 
ceedingly difficult for the Negro 
voters, who think, to discover what 
they would lose by the defeat of 
the Republican party. The dis¬ 


franchisement of Southern Negro 
citizens by the Democrats of that 
section has the complete acquies¬ 
cence of the Republican party. 
By his Southern Negro policy 
President Taft has given it his 
unqualified approval. The plan 
under way to cut down Southern 
representation in Republican Na¬ 
tional Conventions is a direct at¬ 
tempt on the part of certain Re¬ 
publican leaders to make Negro 
disfranchisement nation wide. In 
furtherance of this policy President 
Taft has removed from federal 
office in the South something like 
three hundred Negro office holders 
filling their places with “lilly 
whites" and Democrats. 

In the North and West the only 
local recognition the Negro receives 
above a few menial positions, he 
gets from the Democrats. Mass. 
New York and Ohio are striking 
examples. In each of the above 
named states the Democrats have 
given the Negro voters signal recog¬ 
nition . 

We are not advising the Negroes 
to go into the Democratic party 
but the anti-Negro policy of the 
Republicans coupled with the recog¬ 
nition given the Negroes by the 
Democrats in the north, may 
bring about that result. 

The Republican ship is on the 
rocks; if it goes down to rise no 
more, will human rights lose any¬ 
thing? 


BLACK RACE TO RULE THE 
EARTH 

Such Is Opinion of English Anthro¬ 
pologist 

Declares Americans are reverting 
to Indian type of Red and dark- 


brown skins, and believes melt¬

ing New Man, 


“Colored races will rule the earth 
and the white race will be entirely 
extinct in a few more centuries, ac¬ 
cording to Charles Y. Lloyd, an 
English authority in anthropology, 
who with Prof. Lionel W. Lyde of 
the University of London, has been 
making an exhaustive study of 
the graduation of the white race 
to that of the Sariuos black races. 
Lloyd has been studying Americans 
and their characteristics during 
the psat three months. He is 
living in practical retirement at 
the Seminole Hotel." 


Prof. Lloyd said yesterday that 
the original color of the human 
skin was a dark brown, the varia¬ 
tions from that color being due 
to different climatic conditions, 
which serve to weaken or strenghten 
the underlying pigments. 

“The various white nationalities 
of the world are gradually growing 
darker," he said. “In this country 
particularly is there a noticeable 
decrease in the number of natural 
blondes. Fair-haired and fair¬ 
skinned persons are becoming fewer 
and fewer and dark hair, brown 
or red complexions and general 
brunette color, are becoming com¬

“In tropical countries the white 
man has never been able to live 
in health. With ordinary precau¬ 
tions a man may live after two 
years of acclomatization immune 
from most of the tropical diseases, 
but after five or six years more the

JIM CROW NEGROES 


A Cleveland Gazette Ohio cor¬ 
respondent writing from Columbus 
in that state, has the following 
to say regarding the jim crowr 
Negro. 

“Like in Cleveland, the work of 
years has been ruined in months 
by a few ‘immigrant’ Negro ‘block¬ 
heads’ who style themselves 
‘leaders’—individuals who will 
urge separate schools, ‘jim crow’ 
anything if only they can benefit 
themselves by so doing. Why a 
Taft Negro office holder at Wash¬ 
ington, D. C. whose home is in 
this city, even had the ‘nerve’ 
and ‘gall’ to write a letter recently 
to a local daily paper that has a 
‘jim-crow’ column in its Sunday 
edition which his father writes, 
trying to make our people here 
believe a lie—that Taft was not 
almost equally responsible with 
‘Brownsville’ Roosevelt for that 
dismissal-without-honor and in dis¬ 
grace of the ‘Black Battalion’ 
which numbers 167 as brave and 
manly soldiers as ever were in the 
U. S. Army.” 

We have the same trouble in 


Los Angeles only, we are cursed 
with a bigger herd of these “block¬ 
heads” than perhaps any other 
city in the north or west. 

They hit the town with a great 
flare of trumpets and before they 
find a place to lodge, they open 
a campaign for separate schools 
and separate everything. They 
organize political clubs and pro¬ 
ceed to tell us how to vote and for 
whom to vote. Boasting of their 
college (?) and other attainments 
they say in effect: follow me, you 
ignoramuses, I know what you 
need. In this city the public and 
a number of private schools 
are open to Negroes, the Chamber 
of Commerce, the state press and 
bar associations and public lectures 
and churches are open to Negroes 
but in spite of these conditions, 
these ‘immigrant’ Negroes 
who don’t pay taxes on a foot of 
land, are chasing around advocat¬ 
ing “separate this and that” in 
the hope of getting something 
for nothing at the expense of the 
race. These “jim crow” Negroes 
would readily turn California into 
Mississippi or Georgia with their 
brutal lynching records and j im 
crow cars, if they could only live 
without work. Why this class of 
Negroes left the South is a mystery.

REACHING LIFE'S GOAL 


If you want to be somebody in 
this world, you must assert your 
individuality, and assert it in the 
right direction, so that it may lead 
to a goal of honor for yourself and 
be an example for others. Find 
out what you ought to do, say to 
yourself: “I must do it,” then 
begin right away with “I will do 
it,” and keep at it until it is done. 


OUR WEAK KNEED BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS 

The subterfuge offered by the 
Good Government members of the 
Board of Supervisors in their 
attempt to draw the color line in the 
nurse training school at the county 
hospital, increases in ridiculousness 
no matter from what angle the 
thing is considered. The races are 
enjoying the most helpful and 
friendly relations toward each other. 
The public schools are open to 
Negro children, with hundreds of 
them in daily attendance preparing 
to become worthy citizens of the 
republic. The University of Calif¬ 
ornia at Berkeley, the Stanford 
University, the University of 
Southern California, the Law School 
and medical colleges are all open 
to Negroes, and each year adds 
to the list of Negro graduates from 
these great institutions of learning. 
And yet, the Good Government (?) 
members of the Board of Super¬ 
visors would have the people be¬ 
lieve that certain nurses at the 
nurse training school of the county 
hospital are so cruel and heartless 
that they would let the si,ck and 
unfortunates • of that institution 
die for lack of attention if Negro 
girls, graduates of our mixed schools 
and colleges, are admitted. 

It is to fit themselves to become 
messengers of mercy in the sick 
room, that Negro girls seek admis¬ 
sion into the training school— 
that's all. 

Do the nurses run the county 
hospital? If so, why have the 
supervisors been killing time a- 
round there? 

It looks as if the office of Super¬ 
visor is too big for some of the 
members. It will be no task to 
find men as big as the office. They 
will be forth coming. Men who 
in their official capacities discrimi¬ 
nate against the weak, will in the 
end prove unsafe guardians of 
the interest of the strong. 


WHITE CHURCH PEOPLE 
MAKING SKEPTICS 


Some weeks ago this city and 
state was visited by a number of 
distinguished bishops and church 
men touring the country in what 
they seemed to believe or called 
a crusade against sin—“America 
for Christ.” These divines were 
followed by Gypsy Smith. Now, 
we have the “Men and Religion” 
movement.” But the thing is that 
impresses the average person who 
thinks, is the one sided manner in 
which these good men are making 
their fight on wickedness. In 
spite of the brazen fact that men 
and women of color—American 
citizens are cruelly put to death 
at the rate of almost one a day by 
mobs, these good men have 
uttered not one word condemnatory 
of these brutal, cold blooded mur¬ 
ders of innocent men and women. 
On the question of mob murders 
there seems to be a mutual silence. 
A religion that cannot condemn 
murder because the victims are 
members of a defenceless race, may 
be alright for dress parade purposes 
but it will not put a stop to the 
white slave traffic, neither will it 
check the blighting march or moral 
corruption that threatens to destroy 
all holy family relations. Oh no, 
the white pulpits have nothing 
to say against hanging and burn¬ 
ing innocent Negro women provided 
that white men commit the crime. 
What a spectacle they made of 
themselves some time ago by pro¬ 
testing against Russian outrages 
upon the Jews. 

Gentlemen you are deceiving 
yourselves and making more skep¬ 
tics in your race than church mem¬ 
bers. “One thing thou lackest” go 
and repent, get rid of your race 
prejudice and you will be able to 
cry aloud and with effect against 
all manner of wickedness.
