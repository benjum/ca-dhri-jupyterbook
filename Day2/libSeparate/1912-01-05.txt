EARTH IS ENOUGH 

B>l Edwin Markham 
WE MEN of Earth have here the 
Stuff 

Of Paradise—we have enough! 

We need no other thing to build 
The Stairs into the Unfulfilled— 

No other ivory for the doors— 

No other marble for the floors— 

No other cedar for the beam 
And dome of man’s immortal dream 
HERE on the paths of every day— 
Here on the common human way 
Is all the busy gods would take 
To build a Heaven, to mould and 
make 

New Edens. Ours the stuff sub¬ 
lime 

To build Eternity in time! 


“ALL THE PEOPLE GETTING 
TOGETHER” 

By Lincoln Steffens 

I have successively pinned my 
faith to three hopes oi salvation for 
the city. First, hope in salvation 
of the city through one good man, 
a man exerting such an influence 
for righteousness as will galvanize 
the whole municipality into right¬ 
eous life. 

But I saw that good men die, 
and that their ideals do not live 
forever after them. 

Then I thought that salvation 
would come through all the good 
people banding together and fight¬ 
ing shoulder to shoulder. But I 
found that it wouldn’t work. The 
hypocriey that permeates the ranks 
of those whom it is conventional 
to call the good people always works 
disaster to such movements. 


Lastly, I have come to hope in 
all the people getting together. 

I am convinced that it is the 
only way. That is the idea of 
the social center movement. 

REV. R. C. BEDFORD DEAD. 

A FRIEND OF TUSKEGEE 
GONE 

Rev. R. 0. Bedford of Beloit, 
Wis., whose sudden death from 
heart trouble occurred in this city 
Sunday, had been for years one of 
the moving spirits of the Tuske- 
gee Institute, over which Booker 
T. Washington presides. Bedford 
was secretary of the Board of Trust¬ 
ees, and manager of the institute’s 
finance department. He was also 
trustee of the several affiliated 
schools, and has done much for 
the elevation of the colored race. 
He was born in England; graduated 
from Beloit College in 1872 and was 
ordained a preacher in the Congre¬ 
gational church. A widow and 
several children survive. John, a 
son, is connected with the govern¬ 
ment Forestry Service in Montana. 
Mrs. T. D. Woolsey of Beloit, is 
a daughter. 


LIBERIA INSTALLS PRESIDENT 
HOWARD • 

Crowds Witness Ceremony of In= 
auguration of Successor to Bar=^ 
clay 


(By Associated Press Leased Wire) 
Monrovia, Liberia, Jan. 1.— 
President Daniel Howard was inua- 
gurated today as chief executive of 


the republic of Liberia, succeeding 
President Barclay, who for eight 
years had occupied the office. 

President Howard, after taking 
the oath, read his inaugural address 
in which he expressed satisfaction 
that the protracted negotiations in 
connection with the finances of the 
country had been brought to a con¬ 
clusion through the sympathetic 
interest of the United States, Great 
Britian and other powers. 

Crowds of citizens came from all 
parts of the country to greet their 
new president and Monrovia was full 
of life and color. Natives of var- 
ous tribes came from the interior, 
their primitive garb contrasting 
strongly with that of the women of 
the city, who were dressed in Ara¬ 
bian costumes of vari-colored silks. 

IMPORTANT TO WOMEN 


For the purpose of voting at the 
presidential preference primary in 
May, early registration is a matter 
of importance to all who are not 
at present registered. This applies 
especially to women residing out¬ 
side the city of Los Angeles. All 
the 85,000 Los Angeles women 
who registered for the municipal 
election will be entitled to vote 
at the May primary, whether re¬ 
registered or not. But. the regis¬ 
tration of women in the smaller 
cities and in the rural districts has 
been scant. It will be necessary 
for every woman who wants to 
vote a the presidential primary, 
but who is now unregistered, to 
become registered without delay. 
The county clerk calls attention to 





















TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


the generalj statute under which 
registration for any given primary 
or general election closes 30 days 
before such election is held. This 
would cause registration for the 
May primary to close April 14. 

Another point to which particu¬ 
lar attention should be given by 
women residing in the smaller 
towns and districts is that school 
elections take place on the first 
Friday in April while municipal 
elections in all sixth class cities 
take place on the second Monday 
in April 

Dates of Elections 

The presidential preference pri¬ 
mary will be held Tresdav, May 

14 . ‘ 

The state and local nominating 
primary will be held on Tuesday, 
September 3. 

The general, or presidential and 
state election will be held on Tues¬ 
day, Nov. 5.

HABIT:—ITS RELATION TO 
PHYSICAL TRAINING 


in looking for physical perfec¬ 
tion it is not a question of how large 
or how small but how symetrical; 
two persons may be of the same 
height nearly the same weight 
and still vary greatly in apparent 
size, as one has large bones and the 
other small it would be reasonable 
to say that the weight should be 
the same but both frames should 
be well covered, easily rounded, 
every muscle active and flexible. 
Then we are on the road to physical 
perfection. It is on the same 
principle as a circle, no matter how 
large or how small it still has its 
regular proportions. Most of this 
symetrical development depends on 


continued activity that aims 
develop health and general efficiency 
more than mere strength. 

In all the countries of Europe, 
excepting England, men are com¬ 
pelled to spend from three months 
to twelve years in the army; they 
always show the effects of this dis¬ 
cipline in their steady eye, springy 
swinging step and martial bearing. 
America is meeting this demand for 
training in her West Point, her 
Annapolis. And every city boasts 
of its military school for boys. 
The effect of all this is that the 
person so trained accomplishes 
more with a less expenditure of 
energy, has greater endurance, 
greater poise ( something that 
gives dignity because of perfect 
control) and he stands out—looks 
different —from the crowd of hu¬ 
manity that has not had it. In 
the female colleges and particularly 
in Seminaries and private schools 
a similar training is going on to 
meet the need of the gentler sex. 
All of us would be better for this 
finishing touch but all cannot be 
so fortunate. We can, however, 
set ourselves to forming habits 
that will be helpful and pleasing. 
Habit is a mental path over which 
our actions have traveled from 
time to time and each time travelled 
the path gets deeper .until a groove 
is formed. Anything becomes a 
habit when it is enacted or gone 
through with so many times that 
it can be accomplished without 
direct thought. Let us begin to 
get the habit of a better carriage, 
sitting correctly, getting up from 
a chair easily and gracefully and 
standing correctly. We don't need 
a teacher for these if we use our 
eyes and PRACTICE, PRACTICE 
until it becomes a habit. The 
weight should be on the ball of the 
foot, shoulders back but not up and 
chest high, abdomen in and knees 
straight. Now assume this posi¬ 
tion and then relax enough to take 
the stiffness out of it and start walk¬ 
ing with the idea of giving your 
chest, not your head or your should¬ 
ers or your stomach, to the world. 
Let the limbs swing from the hip 
putting the weight of the body al¬ 
ways on the ball of the foot. 


THE FOOL’S PARADISE HEARD 
FROM 

EDUCATION AND EDUCATED 
NEGROES DENOUNCED 

That cesspool of ignorance and 
venality known as the Forum 
and better known from its actions 
as the “Fools Paradise/' named its 
chief and near chief last Sun¬ 
day. Most of the time was 
spent in extoling the unlimited 
knowledge of the chief. Not 
to be outdone in bidding for the 
favors of the chair, lawyers Tylor 
hopped up and added to ‘the 
levity of the occasion by stating 
that the chief possessed a ju¬ 
dicial temperament to an ex¬ 
ceedingly high degree. This 
brought the president to his feet. 
He, all through the siege, had sat 
wreathed in smiles like a school 
boy in knee breeches at a school 
exhibition where the said boy was 
the leading star. He proceeded 
at length to testify to the truthful¬ 
ness of all that had been said con¬ 
cerning his superior knowledge and 
and statesmanship. He said that 
he could hardly suppress the joy 
it gave him to know that his wis¬ 
dom and rare statemanship had 
been discovered before his death— 
a pleasure that so few of the world's 
statesmen ever enjoyed. 

Jones Shows Fight 

The nomination of A. J. Jones 
for vice-president called forth the 
first serious remark. Mr. J. W. 
Coleman arose and objected to the 
nomination on the grounds that 
Jones was incompetent. Mr. Jones 
scrambled to his feet and snort¬ 
ed like a wild buck, and in 
self-eulogy he outdid the president. 
He said he could draw his check 
for a larger sum than any other 
Negro in the city. He said he 
could buy a whole hog-pen full 
of Negroes like Coleman. Mr. 
Jones regards himself as the Rocke¬ 
feller of these parts. All things con¬ 
sidered, to say that any man, out¬ 
side of the insane asylum, is 
incompetent to preside at the For¬ 
um's meetings is certainly putting 
a very low estimate upon his 




















THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


ability. Mr. Jones realized this 
and roared like an African lion. He 
finally subsided and the meeting 
was thrown open for thoughtless 
talks. One young man, prominent 
in Y. M. C. A. circles got the floor 
and opened a tirade of abuse upon 
educated Negroes. He said among 
other things that the colleges were 
ruining the Negroes and that col¬ 
lege bred Negroes were filling the 
penitentiaries. His false and in¬ 
sulting statement provoked such 
a storm of applause that the 
sargeant—at—arms had to re¬ 
store order. 

In the crowd taking part in that 
mess were the secretary of the 
Colored Y. M. C. A, a college man, 
lawyer Tvlor from Harvard and 
a number of high school students. 
It was not the speaker, but the 
applause his insult elicited showed 
the character of the crowd com¬ 
posing that body. 

The man who made the state¬ 
ment and many of those who 
applauded him are members of 
the Y. M. C. A. If that’s their 
view of education and educated 
Negroes, why build a hundred 
thousand dollar Y. M. C. A.? 
Why allow the Negro boys and girls 
attending the high schools to con¬ 
tinue? 

How any man claiming to be 
educated can visit that place from 
Sunday to Sunday and listen to 
such stuff is beyond comprehension. 

O, yes, to say that a man of Mr. 
Jones’ caliber is not competent 
to preside over the Forum is enough 
to make him fight. 


TAYLOR THROWN DOWN 


That bunch treated lawyer Tay¬ 
lor so cool after it leaked out that 
he was a candidate for the legis¬ 
lature, that he made himself scarce. 
In making their emancipation pro- 
grom they ignored Taylor entirely. 
Attorney Tyler, although occupy¬ 
ing the seat from which Taylor 
has been kicked, was also over¬ 
looked in the program-making. 
Now if Tyler can convince them 
that the time he spent in school 
was so much time thrown away, he 


will prove his fitness to lead them. 
Will he “ come across?” 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


Mrs. Le Roy D. Barnett left on 
the 25th of December for Detroit, 
Michigan to attend the funeral 
of her father who died suddenly. 
Mr. R. C. Davis, Mrs. Barnett’s 
father, was one of the most promi¬ 
nent men in that city. 

The memorial services held at 
the Mount Zion Baptist church 
were attended by a large audience. 
The services were conducted by 
Rev. J. T. Hill, pastor, in a very 
impressive manner. 

The Emancipation services held 
at Wesley Chapel on the first were 
attended by a good sized audience. 
The crowd was much smaller than 
that of two years ago, due very 
largely to the policy of those who 
were in charge. A narrow pro¬ 
scriptive policy may gratify those 
pursuing it, but it/does not build 
up the best interests of the com¬ 
munity. 

You cannot promote intelli¬ 
gence by putting it under a ban. 

Mrs. Booth, a much loved mem¬ 
ber of the Eighth street Christian 
Church, passed to her reward last 
Thursday. She will be greatly 
missed as she was ever faithful 
to the cause of the church. She 
was the mother of Mr. George 
Booth, one of the leading young 
men and workers of that church.

HAPPY NEW YEAR 
TO ALL 

The Liberator extends to its 
happy and generous family of 
readers, best wishes for their success 
for this and succeeding years. 

Twelve years ago, next April, 
The Liberator made its first visit 
to a thousand homes in this city 
and county, and received a welcome 
that has grown more cordial with 
each succeeding visit. At the de¬ 
mand of its readers, this journal 
changed its monthly visits to weekly 
visits and still the demand is 
made for more frequent calls. 

We hope some day, by re-enforc¬ 
ing its editorial department with 
the infu sion of new and more 
vigorous blood to fulfill every de¬ 
mand of a generous public. 

For the generous support the 
people have given this journal we 
retu rn ou r sincere th anks. 

Happy New Year to all.

Pacific Coast. Cuts of many of 
the splendid homes owned by the 
colored people will also appear. 
Churches, lodges, stores and offices 
of our business and .professional 
men and women will testify as to 
the Negro's splendid achievements 
in this wonderland of the great 
west. How a mere handful of 
colored people in this city grew to

millions of wealth will be graphic¬ 
ally told.
