THE NEGRO IN DOMESTIC SER¬ 
VICE. 

By Justice R. H. Terrell. 

(From the Colored American Maga¬ 
zine.) 

I think that if no other paper had been 
read at this meeting that this Business 
Men’s Conference would have been a 
success after listening to the splendid 
paper which has been read by Mr. Vil- 
lard. I say this because I have come 
in contact with this servant problem, 
not only indirectly, but directly. I 
went into the hotel to work as a boy 
while struggling for an education, at 
the age of eleven years. I stayed there 
until I rose to the dignity of a head- 
waiter (and all you know what a pom¬ 
pous dignity that is.) In my experi¬ 
ence as a headwaiter, I found iLa most 
difficult problem to deal with tisif, wait¬ 
ers under my care because jjfjf! a tfalse 
idea of independence. The would 

say when they did not do their work 
properly and had to be censured for it, 
that “I am not married to this job; 
I can get a place somewhere else.” And 
I have been anxious to attend the meet¬ 
ings of the Headwaiters’ Association in 
order that I might urge upon them the 
necessity of preaching at all times the 
doctrine to the men under them to the 
effect that they must do their work well 
if they want to maintain their jobs 
which all men are struggling for, in¬ 
cluding the Irish, the German, the Ital¬ 
ian, and the French. I have come in 
direct contact with this servant prob¬ 
lem, now what has been my indirect 
contact with this servant problem? 

I have the honor of being judge of 
one of the courts of the District of Co¬ 
lumbia, and I want to say this, that day 
after day I have to deal with this ser¬ 
vant problem. These colored girls and 
colored young men are constantly com¬ 
ing before my court claiming wages 
from their masters, and when the mat¬ 
ter is brought to trial, it is found that 
in three cases out of five, the servant 
it at fault. The evidence clearly goes 
to show that the servant goes off in 
the Summer time to picnics, excursions, 
neglects her work, frequently goes out 
and stays all night and fails to turn 
up in the morning at her working place, 
and in mapy cases the employer has to 
go to work without his breakfast. And 
yet that same servant comes into court 


and claims wages for a whole month 
and says that she has been dismissed 
“without cause.” 

When I was a boy in Washington, 
there was no such thing as a white 
butler, a white coachman, and those 
who are here from Washington can tell 
you that under the present regime more 
than half the butlers and waiters and 
servants of Washington are white. And 
why? Because the people who have 
money to pay out for services of this 
kind will pay it out to people who are 
going to do it best; and we need not say 
that the same argument should obtain 
in the case when a white girl is found 
to be inefficient for that does not justify 
the shortcomings of our servants. We 
have this condition to face: There are 
90,000 colored people in the city of 
Washington; indeed, the police-census 
says 98,000 nearly all of whom must 
get their living by working, and of this 
number, I am sorry to say, there are 
about 25,000 who don’t work and won’t 
work. Now that is one side of it. On 
the other hand, we know that there 
are cases of course, where employers 
are often unfair to their servants, 
where they treat their servants meanly 
occasionally, where they don’t give their 
girls decent rooms in which to live, and 
where they don’t treat them well. But 
that is no reason why our girls should 
not do their whole duty. 

Now here is a most serious phase, 
and I am satisfied almost every man 
in this house will agree with me when 
I say that the most serious phase- of 
this servant question is the fact that 
it is almost impossible to get colored 
men and colored women to work for 
members of their own race. I am sorry 
to be compelled to say this in the pres¬ 
ence of white men because it is the 
deepest indication of a lack of self-re¬ 
spect. The idea is a sad one to contem¬ 
plate, that colored men and colored 
women w ho desire and have means to 
pay for help are not able to get it from 
their own people. I know a family in 
Washington, almost white in complex¬ 
ion, who are identified with our race 
and who employed a woman servant. 
The servant thought that the woman 
with whom she had made arrangements 
for employment was white and this col¬ 
ored servant worked for them very well 
until one day a black gentleman, accom¬ 
panying the head of the house, came 
into town, and when the colored wait¬ 


ress walked into the dining room and 
saw who her employers really were, she 
dropped the tray, breaking it and all the 
dishes. She walked out of that house, 
did not even ask for her pay and never 
came back. I knew of another case 
where a colored family wanted to hire a 
washer-woman. They inserted an ad¬ 
vertisement in the newspaper to that 
effect. When a colored woman came 
in answer thereto, (thinking the parties 
who advertised were white), she asked, 
“Are you Mrs. So-andSo,—are you the 
lady of the house?” And when in¬ 
formed that she was the “Mrs. So-and¬ 
So’ who wanted a washer-woman, the 
applicant promptly replied, “Lady, I 
can’t wash for you because I am in so¬ 
ciety myself.” 

I, therefore, call upon all of our col¬ 
ored preachers, the men who have the 
most potent influence over our people, 
and I urge them to tell these girls 
and to tell the boys of our race that they 
must do their work well or they will be 
driven out of employment. I would 
urge them to tell these girls and to 
tell these boys that no kind of honest 
labor is a disgrace, neither is it a re¬ 
proach or a shame to work for their 
own people. 


We have heard nothing from the Sun¬ 
day School teachers relative to the or¬ 
ganization of a teacher’s association. In 
the October number of this journal we 
called attention to the necessity of such 
an organization. Our attendance of the 
county Sunday School convention, com¬ 
posed mainly of the white teachers, con¬ 
vinced us mo.re than ever of the neces¬ 
sity of such an organization among the 
colored teachers. While all Sunday 
Schools were invited to send rep.esen- 
tatives to the convention, there was only 
one colored Sunday School represented 
—that of Wesley Chapel. If all colored 
Sunday schools sent representatives, 
there would still remain the need of a 
colored association, to consider matters 
that only race teache.s should discuss, 
and conditions that onl y race te achers 
must meet. If the white Sunday School 
teachers find such an organization neces¬ 
sary, how much more so is such an or¬ 
ganization needed among the colored 
teachers!

THE PRESIDENT AND HIGHER 
EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. 

Mr. Roosevelt’s speeches have been 
models of their kind. His intimations 
at the Third Baptist Academy at Jack¬ 
sonville were defined with a vengeance 
at Tuskegee Institute. To our mind, 
he made an open attack upon the higher 
educaton of the Negro. Certainly, he 
chilled every instructor in every Negro 
college in the land. He said “The pro¬ 
fessional and mercantile avenues to suc¬ 
cess are overcrowded; for the present 
the best chance of success awaits the 
intelligent worker at some mechanical 
trade'or on a farm, for this man will 
almost certainly achieve industrial inde¬ 
pendence.” 

If these institutions have already 
overcrowded the professions, what fur¬ 
ther use- can there be for their exist¬ 
ence? In Jacksonville, Mr. Roosevelt 
modified his utterances by saying that 
they aoplied to the whites as well as 
to the colored and he would say the 
• same to both. In his address at Tuske¬ 
gee, all of this was omittel and he used 
no words of qualification in his whole¬ 
sale endorsement of the ordinary train¬ 
ing of the Negroes. 

The address in all other respect was 
a gem and will hardly come in for a 
share of criticism from any quarter. 
The question which we would like to 
hear and see discussed is, Are the pro¬ 
fessional and mercantile avenues for the 
Negro overcrowded? 

If the President of the United States 
has been correctly informed, then what 
becomes of the Negro Business League 
of which the distinguished Booker T. 
Washington, A. M. is President? If 
that gentleman construed the utterances 
to be even an unintentional attack upon 
the mercantile pursuits on the part of 
the Negroes, then his position must 
have been most embarrassing. 

But President Roosevelt may not 
have intended to go as far as his utter¬ 
ances along these lines seem to have 
carried him. Selah.—Richmond Planet. 

Except the President’s seeming blow 
at higher education for negroes, his 
speeches on his Southern tour have the 
unqualified approval of the colored race 
everywhere. Plis reference to the over¬ 
crowding of professional pursuits cannot 
apply to the Negroes with but one col¬ 
lege trained man to every 2,800 persons 
of color the professional pursuits from 


this viewpoint cannot be regarded as. 
overcrowded. The Board of Education 
of the M. E.. Church South, which un¬ 
derstands the Negro better perhaps than 
the President, says: 

“We recognize the need of the race 
for its own preachers, teachers and lite¬ 
rary men, as well as for its own pub¬ 
lic servants in the various professions. 
While we admit the great value of in¬ 
dustrial training for the negro, we at 
the same time believe that the higher 
college and university training is of 
still greater value in the present state 
of his development, because his advance¬ 
ment can not be secured without com¬ 
petent leadership from his own midst. 
He must develop self-respect. As long 
as he considers himself inferior to 
others, socially and morally, it will be 
impossible for him to advance in civili¬ 
zation. He must have and respect his 
own institutions, especially those of 
the family and the church.” 

These are strong words and when 
the source from which they come is 
considered the higher education of the 
Negro needs no stronger endorsement. 

The Negro is a citizen and compon¬ 
ent part of the greatest republic of 
modern times, and if it is ever to be 
what it nretends to be the Negro will 
have to have the same education and the 
same opportunity that is given other 
citizens. Class education is as danger¬ 
ous to free institutions as is class legis¬ 
lation. What is good for the white 
man is good for the Negro. 


MORE FARMERS NEEDED. 

The progress made by the race in the 
acquisition of homes has been highly 
satisfactory for the year now closing. 
But the need of colored farmers to sus¬ 
tain and make independent our rapidly 
increasing population, is very urgent. 
The tendency of the race in the West 
to become a race of consumers is a 
hurtful one. White immigrants are pour¬ 
ing into this state by the thousands each 
day and .unless the colored people buy 
land and become producers as well as 
consumers, they will lose ground never 
to be regained. The chance for colored 
families to buy farms and become self 
supporting is growing less eacli year, 
the land becoming scarcer and higher. 

The white immigrants are flocking to 
the country districts while the negroes 
are Hocking to the cities. In ten years 


the white immigrant who goes to the 
country and buvs farm land., w.iH be 
independent, while the black man who 
goes to the city will be farther behind 
than he is now. There is more gold in 
the California farms than there isdn her 
mines. 

We know a retired white school 
teacher, more than' eighty years of age, 
who earns $20 per month from vege¬ 
tables. raised on three village lots. We 
know others who are living independ¬ 
ently on the proceeds of an acre. How 
we wish our people would now take up 
farming land and lay a> sure foundation 
for future independence and happiness! 


THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. 

The result of the recent elections are 
gratifying to those voters who put man¬ 
hood rights and good government above 
party, success. The result in Maryland 
buried Gasman and Negro disfranchise¬ 
ment, it is hoped, forever. The crush¬ 
ing defeat of the infamous Poe Amend¬ 
ment was mainly due to the fact that 
its adoption would have disfranchised 
thousands of white voters of foreign 
parentage and would have given Gor¬ 
man and his unscrupulous gang a per¬ 
petual lease on the State government. 
I11 Pennsylvania graft under the name 
of Republicanism, was utterly destroyed. 
The lesson taught the bosses in Ohio 
was a wholesome one which will not 
soon be forgotten. The colored voters 
of that State took a prominent part 
in the overthrow of the bosses. 

The results in New York and San 
Francisco, where Hearst is believed to 
have beaten McClellan and Mayor 
Schmitz, who easily beat the Republi¬ 
can and Democratic parties combined, 
serves a good purpose by showing the 
country the ease with which white voters 
will desert their parties .and chase off 
after any man with a, few newisms and 
a promise of something for nothing, 
and freedom from the law’s restraints. 
There are thousands and thousands of 
while voters who believe the govern¬ 
ment should support them in idleness 
and other thousands that are opposed 
to any form of government. This mot¬ 
ley aggregation, whose right to vote, un¬ 
like the loyal Negro’s is never ques¬ 
tioned, will follow any demagogue who 
caters to their prejudice. These, to¬ 
gether with the ever-increasing army of 
grafters that will follow any man or 
any thing that offers opportunity for 
graft, foreshadows serious trouble for 
this country. While the parties and poli¬ 
ticians are devising ways and means 
to get rid of the Negro lawless while 
men are planting bombs beneath their 
feet.

WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON. 

The one hundredth anniversary of the 
birth of William Lloyd Garrison will be 
fittingly observed by the colored 
churches and other societies in this city 
on December ioth. The services that 
great man rendered humanity by setting 
in motion the revolution that resulted 
in the destruction of chattel slavery in 
this country cannot be stated in figures. 
If the blessings derived from the eman¬ 
cipation of the Ame.ican slaves had been 
confined to them alone, its achievement 
would have been glory enough for any 
man. But when we take into consid¬ 
eration the fact that Garrison’s revolu¬ 
tion freed American white men as well, 
the vastness of his work can be partially 
realized. 

The man who secures the liberation 
from slavery of even a small portion 
of the human family sets in motion a 
revolution that will' eventually free the 
whole race from every form of slavery. 
Every slave liberated makes slavery less 
popular. If righteousness exalteth a 
nation, the white free men of this coun¬ 
try suffered more from the blighting ef¬ 
fects of slavery than did the black 
slaves. It made the Declaration of Inde¬ 


pendence a Earning lie, made the nation 
a nation of brazen hypocrits and brought 
forth upon this continent a scourge of 
moral leprosv by making the virtue of 
the female slave a plaything. Slavery 
stilled free speech, placed a censor over 
every northern home and trampled in 
the dust every right held sacred. While 
dwarfing all moral propensities, it gave 
a free hand to all evil ones. Its perse¬ 
cution made the slave a Christian and 
the slave holder a sinner. The freedom 
of the slaves gave the master an oppor¬ 
tunity to straighten up and be a man; 
an opportunity to forsake his sins and 
return to his God. While the negroes 
will ever hold dear the memory of that 
great man and benefactor, none owe him 
a greater debt of gratitude than do the 
white men of this republic. 


MISS HALLIE Q. BROWN. 

An eloqutionist of international fame 
and prominently identified with the W. 
C. T. U., will spend the winter in this 
state. Her time while here will be de¬ 
voted to the cause of temperance and 
the moral uplifting of our people. Her 
recitals in this city have been very 
largely attended, and have been so well 
received that each succeeding recital was 
greeted by an increased attendance. Miss 
Brown is one of those speakers whose 
eloquence, fervor and earnestness di¬ 
vorces the mind of the listener from all 
else save the cause for which she plead?. 
From start to finish she has complete 
control of her audience, and not only 
convinces her hearers that h-er cause is 
just, but inspires in the bosom of each 
hearer a determination to lead a bet¬ 
ter life and to make sacrifices that the 
sum of human happiness may be in¬ 
creased. The work this noble, self-sac- 
ificing young woman is doing for the 
uplifting of humanity is inestimable. 

To those of us who are struggling 
against heavy odds to keep the hearts- 
of our young inclined towards righteous¬ 
ness, her visit here is a God-send. What 
a breathing spell it gives to the faith¬ 
ful few who are struggling against sor¬ 
did selfishness, to have this good woman 
who comes among us like an angel of 
light preaching the gospel that “life is 
more than meat,” and that the souls of 
men and women are of more value than 
money; and that life devoid of sacri¬ 
fices for the common good is life wasted. 


We have in our midst a great and holv 
woman, and her stay will be both pleas¬ 
ant and profitable to her as well as to 
ourselves, in proportion as we lead lives 
of righteousness, temperance and clean¬ 
liness. The press, pulpit and all who 
are interested in the moral and temp¬ 
oral welfare of our race should lend 
Miss Brown every possible aid and en¬ 
couragement. She will spend a few 
weeks in San Francisco, and will be en¬ 
tertained as befits one of her work and 
worth. 


“It is pretended that 1 am retarding 
the cause of emancipation by the coarse¬ 
ness of my invective and the precip¬ 
itancy of my measures. The charge is 
not true . On this question my influence, 
—humble as it is,—is felt at this moment 
to a considerable extent, and shall be 
felt in coming years—not perniciously, 
but beneficially—not as a curse, but as 
a blessing; and posterity will bear test¬ 
imony that 1 was right. I desire to 
thank, God, that he enables me to disre¬ 
gard “the fear of man which bringeth 
a snare,” and to speak his truth in its 
simplicity and power.”—Wm. Lloyd 
Garrison.

JUSTICE R. H. TERRELL. 

One of the mast interesting addresses 
delivered at the recent Negro Business 
League was by Justice Robert H. Ter¬ 
rell, on the “Negro in Domestic Ser¬ 
vice." In the course of his remarks 
the Judge spoke of girls leaving their 
jobs to go on summer excursions and 
to picnics, and of the impossibility of 
wealthy colored families securing do¬ 
mestic help among their own people. 
This is all too true. The result is we 
are losing these positions as a race, for 
wherever a Negro proves himself un¬ 
worthy of a position, and i-s discharged 
in nine out of ten cases. The position 
is forever closed to the race. This ac¬ 
counts for the white barber, gardener, 
coachman, and hotel waiter. 

The greatest impediment to the Negro 
wage earner in Southern California is a 
summer excursion and mcmc given by 
some of our preachers who probably 
get a small rakeoff from the railroad 
company for getting up this annual ex¬ 
cursion, with the exception of the few 
Negroes who are independent self-sup¬ 
porting, or dead, or sick, or in jail, the 
entire race will be in this excursion at 
any cost. All future necessities will be 
ignored, good positions forfeited, old 
men will lay down their tools, surrender 
the bridle reins; young men and boys 
will leave good positions as porters and 
hotel waiters. Old women, young 
women and girls will leave positions 
as cooks, waitresses and nurses if neces¬ 
sary for this one day’s pleasure On the 
following morning one-third of them 
will be out of employment, and com¬ 
plaining about hard times and race 
prejudice, and yet, as strange as it may 
seem, J udge Terrell has been criticised 
severely for this address—Junius. 


THE DEVIL GOT HIS DIES 

The old, and perhaps true saying, 
“That whatever goes over the devil’s 
back is sure to bind bis belly/’ was 
forcibly brought to mind a short time 
ago when a Negro barber, who caters 
to the vicious, envious element of the 
white race,, by drawing the color 
line, moped into a white restau¬ 
rant for a lttirch. The proprietor, one 
of his patrons being of the same caliber, 
refused to serve him on the grounds 
that the said barber was a Negro. In¬ 
stead of taking the medicine of bis own 


making, as he should have done, he 
went to court and kicked like a bobtail 
mule in flytime. The justice court, 
which is catering to the same element, 
at the expense of the Negro’s rights, 
fed the barber on his own swill by turn¬ 
ing him down on a technicality. 

A few weeks ago, we stopped to get 
a shine at a bootblack stand in front 
of a barbershop run by Negroes and 
was almost paralyzed by being informed 
by the Negro bootblack that they didn't 
shine shoes for Negroes. 

We have witnessed insults of every 
kind and character heaped upon our 
men and women by low, prejudiced 
whites, but we never experienced such 
a feeling of disgust, anger and humilia¬ 
tion as we did on that occasion. Two 
blocks away, and on the most prominent 
street in the city, we went to a boot- 
black stand run by white men and got 
a first-class shine. These white men 
are shining shoes for money, and as 
soon as they get enough of it, they will 
go into other business and their chil¬ 
dren will eventually move in first-class 
white society, while children- of the 
said Negroes will be shining shoes all 
day and shooting craps all night. Like 
begets like, The stream cannot rise 
higher than the fountain. 


DISTINGUISHED VISITORS. 

Among the distinguished visitors to 
the city during the national W. C. T. 
U. convention, were four colored women 
of international reputation. They were 1 . 
Mrs. Thurman, of Michigan; Mrs. 
Preston and Miss Hallie Q. Brown, of 
Ohio, and Miss Lynch, of No:th Caro¬ 
lina. The visit of these ladies was a 
rare treat and an inspiration to all who 
had the honor of meeting them. Like 
Miss Brown. Miss Lynch captured all 
hearts by her simplicity and inspiring 
eloquence. It is no wonder that the 
colored people of North Carolina delight 
to do her honor. 

'Phe visit of these noble, self-sacrific¬ 
ing women has increased our faith in 
the future of the race. All that is neces¬ 
sary is “to labor and to wait. 


THE PRESIDENT’S SOUTHERN 

TRIP MADE NO REPUBLICAN 
VOTES IN THAT SECTION. 

In spite of the fact that the South 
went crazy over the President on the 
occasion of his recent visit to that sec¬ 
tion, the elections held in those States 
show a loss, instead of a gain of votes 
for the Republican party. Owing to the 
elements that entered into the contest 
in Maryland, the result there was not 
a test. In Virginia, on a lilly-white 
platform, one of the cleanest, ablest 
white Republicans in that State, the 
candidate for Governor, received in 
round numbers 4000 votes. Secretary 
Shaw, who represents the administra¬ 
tion, made a speech for the ticket, the 
Negroes were given to understand that 
they were not wanted. That his pres¬ 
ence kept white Democrats out of the 
party. Sambo stayed at home and the 
white Democrats voted' as usual. We 
will wager a dime to a doughnut that 
Editor John Mitchell would have polled 
more than did the white Republican, 
and would not have needed the aid of 
Secretary Shaw either. That old fabri¬ 
cation that the white voters of the 
South would divide but for the Negro’s 
participation in politics- has been used 
so often that it is time the white Repub¬ 
licans become sane. The Negro has 
been eliminated from voting in most of 
the Southern States as completely as if 
he was 'dead, for more than- twenty 
years, yet the Republican vote in that 
section has growij less and less. 'Phe 
South is Democratic, and will vote 
solidly for the Democratic ticket re¬ 
gardless of issues or candidates. 

Lilly-whiteism in Virginia was killed 
too dead to skin, and Sambo went 
shouting to its funeral. “It died as the 
fool dieth."
