The Republican Party Has No Presidential Candidate, 

So Senator Works States. 


SENATOR WORKS SAYS: 

“This is a critical time in the 
affairs of the Republican party 
and in the history of the country, 
so much of which has been written 
by that great national party. 

“The party is divided into two 
apparently irreconcilable factions. 
The warfare between them, and 
between their candidates, culmi¬ 
nated in the practical dismember¬ 
ment of the party, for the time 
being at least—it may be forever— 
at Chicago. 

“The preconvention campaign of 
Taft and Roosevelt was a bitter 
personal fight that brought dis¬ 
grace upon the whole country. 
The convention at Chicago was 
the natural culmination of such 
a campaign. It was full of bitter¬ 
ness, animosity and malice. 

“The Taft forces, as represen¬ 
ted by the National Committee, 
intensified this feeling of bitter¬ 
ness by its arbitrary, unjust and 
illegal unseating of Roosevelt dele¬ 
gates and the seating of those 
favorable to Taft. 

“The brutal attacks made on 
the Taft members of the commit¬ 
tee who perpetrated this great 
wrong, by Roosevelt men, added 
fuel to the flames. When the con¬ 
vention met the opposing factions 
were ready to fly at each other’s 
throats. 

Spectacular Roosevelt. 

“The feeling was intensified" by 
Roosevelt’s spectacular appearance 
on the scene, and his scathing de¬ 
nunciation of the Taft forces for 
stocking the convention through 
a subservient National Committee. 
This feeling was so bitter and in¬ 


tense that no compromise on a 
third man was possible. 

“Each side was afraid to let 
go of any delegates for fear they 
would go to the other, and not to 
the new man. So it became a 
fight to a finish, just as malicious 
and just as disgraceful as the 
campaign that preceded it. 

“The Roosevelt forces practi¬ 
cally bolted. They refused to vote 
on the nomination of candidates, 
and went out, and by a resolu¬ 
tion nominated Roosevelt. 
Taft received the vote of those 
who remained, giving him a meager 
majority of 21, including the dele¬ 
gates unlawfully seated and who 
had no right to be there. 

“Neither of these men was ac¬ 
tually and legally nominated. 
Without the votes of the dele¬ 
gates illegally seated by the Na¬ 
tional Committee Taft was de¬ 
feated. The delegates who voted 
for the resolution nominating 
Roosevelt were wholly without au¬ 
thority to act in any such way. 
They were duly elected and ac¬ 
credited delegates to the National 
Republican Convention. They 
had authority to act in that con¬ 
vention, as delegates, and not 
elsewhere or otherwise. They re¬ 
fused to act in that convention as 
they were authorized to do. There 
their authority ceased. 

“So the Republican party has 
no candidate for President. Its 
members are free to vote for whom 
they plaese and may do so withouf 
violating any party obligation or 
fealty. They may vote for the 
Democratic nominee or an inde¬ 
pendent candidate without leaving 
or breaking faith with their own 


party, because it has no candi¬ 
date. 


MR. PRIDHAM IS A CANDI¬ 
DATE FOR RE-ELECTION 


The announcement of Super¬ 
visor Pridham of his intention 
to be a candidate for re-election 
to the office of Supervisor, in the 
Fourth District, makes plain the 
duty of every voter in that disrtict 
regardless of race, color or creed, 
who believes that simple justice 
is the inherent right of every 
individual. Mr. Pridham belongs: 
to an age long dead and is so out 
of harmony with the progress of 
today, that if the spirit of fair 
play is to be maintained, the men 
of his class will have to be kept 
out of public office. The office¬ 
holder who disregards the rights 
of the Negro because he is a Negro, 
will soon disregard the rights of 
a white man, because he is poor. 
The officeholder who accentuates 
race and color distinction as an 
excuse for violating his sworn du¬ 
ties, will manufacture class dis¬ 
tinction for the same reason, lienee 
it is unsafe to elect any man to 
office who recognizes race, color 
or conditions in the performance 
of his public duties, especially 
when the law governing the duties 
of such officers recognizes no such 
distinction. 

The refusal to admit educated, 
refined young colored women to 
the nurse-training school at the 
County Hospital, is a direct as- 
sualt upon the rights of every 
citizen in the county. As chair¬ 
man of the committee having 
charge of the County Hospital,

got onto the move and held a 
secret caucus and chopped off 
every member who showed a dis¬ 
position to indulge in the danger¬ 
ous thing of thinking. Keeping 
their actions a secret, they went 
into the election. When all of the 
members, whose names had been 
stricken from the rolls, who wanted 
a chance to see where the money 
in the treasury went to, were 
added to those who had left in 
disgust, it was found that a mem¬ 
bership of five hundred had 
dwindled down to thirty. Pre¬ 
ceding the election, the first busi¬ 
ness to come before the Paradise, 
was a report of the auditing com¬ 
mittee. “Mr. Cheermun, after run- 
nin' up and down the book, ah 
found dat the writin' was so bad 
dat ah found no head nor tail 
to the thing. I found dat piles 
and piles of money had been took 
in and the funniest thing of all is 
dat money is gone and no sign 
left to show whar it went.” This 
provoked a red hot gabfest, which 
engaged the attention of the Para¬ 
dise for a half hour. Finally, the 
Secretary and the Committee was 
told to get together and find “dat 
money.” 

Election of Officers. 

With everything cut and dried, 
the chief called to the chair a 
young man, said to be a lawyer, 
and made a bluff of holding an 
election. A middle aged man who 
had been appointed for the purpose 
of re-ncminatirg the chief, pro¬ 
nounced him the greatest dip¬ 
lomat of the age. This was fol¬ 
lowed by a significant grin by 
those who understood the “cat- 
hop” that was in store for those 
who were beginning to think. A 
big fellow, six feet tall, from Texas, 
rose to place the name of another 
gentleman in nomination for Presi¬ 
dent, stating as a sort of a prefix, 
that as a result of the Predident's 
superior diplomacy, every person 
who had anything to think about had 
made himself scarce. This shot 
had such a disasterous effect upon 
the acting chairman that he called 
the speaker to order, whereupon 


the point of order was made that 
the speaker was not a member. 
This produced such a row that a 
big six-footer, claiming to be a 
Deputy Sheriff, was called in to 
quell the riot. Order was par¬ 
tially restored, only after he had 
thrown back the lapel of his coat, 
displaying a big Deputy Sheriff 
star, threatening to put any man 
in jail who attempted to run an 
opposition candidate to the Presi¬ 
dent. For awhile, it looked as 
if both the man and his star would 
be a fugitive from the hall. Order 
was finally restored and a roll call 
of the members ordered. The op¬ 
ponents of the bosses realized that 
some mangy trick had been played 
upon them, for the chief and his 
boss had never allowed a roll call 
since they had had charge and you 
can imagine the disgust of the 
crowd when they discovered that 
all but thirty members had been 
emasculated and a big Deputy 
Sheriff threatening to jail any 
member who objected to the pro¬ 
ceedings. In the midst of groans 
and sighs, the chief resumed his 
seat, there being no opposition 
to his re-election. Things have 
been going from bad to worse 
for some time at the Paradise, 
but we hardly thought that it 
had got so bad that a Deputy 
Sheriff would have to be employed 
to prevent a killing at the election 
of officers. “The emasculated 
members feel as sore as a bunch 
of skinned squirrels, but there was 
nothing to do but submit, as they 
were confronted by a big Deputy 
Sheriff, ready to take them to 
jail and a lawyer present, prepared 
to act not only as a prosecutor, 
but a witness, as well,” said one 
of the members. The more hot¬ 
headed were anxious to defy the 
Deputy Sheriff, and break the 
whole thing up in a row, but the 
cooler heads stated that the thing 
was not worth the trouble. One 
fellow said: “When The Liberator 
called this time killing hum bug 
the Fool's Paradise, I thought that 
the Editor of that paper was 
wrong, but now I’ve reached the 
conclusion that most of the boys 
have reached and that is that it 


is the best named thing in the 
state, for that is certainly a Fool's 
Paradise, and nobody but a fool 
can shine there.” 


THE UNION PICNIC 


Ihe big Union Picnic will be 
held at Redondo Beach on July 
26th. That there will be a big 
crowd, goes without saying. Mr.

has secured the skating and ball- 
throwing concessions. There will 
be three grand _ skating sessions. 
The lovers of this amusement can

HAVE YOU REGISTERED? 


If not, you must Register at once. 


The District Attorney has de¬ 
cided that you cannot vote in the 
September primaries unless you 
have registered since the first of 
last January, and in order to 
qualify, you must register between 
now and August 3rd next. It is 
of unusual importance that every 
black man and woman register 
and register at once. There are 
men in office who are candidates 
for re-election who ought and can 
be defeated if every Negro voter 
qualifies and does his duty at the 


polls. There are also men in of¬ 
fice who are candidates for re- 
election who ought to be reelected, 
and will be, if the colored voters 
qualify and join hands with the 
white voters who believe in a 
square deal. It is therefore the 
imperative duty of every black 
man to register himself, see that 
his wife and qualified daughters 
register and request his neighbors 
to do the same thing. It is 
equally the duty of every colored 
woman to register at once and see 
that her husband and qualified 
daughters do the same thing. 

Every young woman should see 
to it that her male companion has 
registered. The young man who 
is of age and fails to register is 
an unfit companion for a self- 
respecting ambitious young woman. 
And the young man who is too un¬ 
manly to accompany you to the 
polls and assist you in electing 
men to office who will respect 
your rights after they are elected, 
will depend upon you for support 
after you marry him. 

It is as much the duty of every 
citizen to register and vote as it 
is to guard his home againsr law¬ 
less intruders. 


NEGRO CANDIDATE FOR THE 
STATE SENATE 


There ought to be one Negro 
candidate for the State Senate 
in the coming primaries in dis¬ 
tricts with big Negro votes. The 
entry of Negro candidates for 
office would have a wholesome 
effect on the color prejudice 
propogander inaugurated by the 
Good Government bunch. The 
colored candidates could either se¬ 
cure the nomination for them¬ 
selves or give it to the opponent 
of the so-called Good Govern¬ 
ment or Progressive candidate. 
Let the Negro voters with their 
votes defeat the political aspira¬ 
tions of a few of these color preju¬ 
dice progressives and this drawing 
of the color line in the public 
service will be a thing of the past. 
With the advantages offered by 
the direct primaries, the Negro 
voters can, by uniting with the 


white voters who believe in a 
square deal, send to private life 
every office-holder, who in viola¬ 
tion of the law, discriminates in 
the performance of his public du¬ 
ties against any citizen on account 
of race or color. 


MAYOR THUM REPLIES 


Says Holmes got a Square Deal 


Pasadena, Cal., July 10, 1912 
The Liberator , 

Los Angeles, Cal. 

Dear Sirs:— 

I return herewith marked clip¬ 
ping from your paper, of June 21st. 
Black men have nothing to fear 
except themselves. A similar re¬ 
mark, however, applies to all men 
of all races. The Negroes of Amer¬ 
ica seem to be advancing as fast 
as other men and this is due to 
the advance the Negro has made 
in knowledge. Knowledge that is 
worthy of the same results in 
intelligent modesty, and true mod¬ 
esty, prepares the mind for more 
thought and still more knowledge. 
Knowledge is the best friend of 
any race. Holmes’ case was de¬ 
cided by men as fair as men can 
be. 

Yours truly, 

William Thum. 


The colored voters should be 
on the lookout for candidates in¬ 
dorsed by the Lissner Committee 
and vote against every one of 
them at the primaries unless he 
comes out squarely for a square 
deal for the Negro. In nine out 
of every ten cases, the Negro 
would do well to cast his lot with 
the old line candidates. It is 
better to go down to defeat with 
an honest man than to victory 
with a side-stepping office-seeker. 
If the color line propaganda in¬ 
augurated by the so-called pro¬ 
gressives is to be smashed, and 
it must be, the solid Negro vote 
must be cast against their candi¬ 
dates.
