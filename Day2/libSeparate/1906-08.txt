Ready for an Aggressive 
Campaign. 

Taxation Without Re¬ 
presentation Must Go. 

THE HATCHET IS BURIED. 

Yielding to the demands for race 
unity, the leader of the various ‘con¬ 
tending factions have agreed to agree 
and concentrate their energies for the 
common advancement of the race. At 
a recent meeting of the Afro-American 
local league, to see all of the old-time 
stalwarts occupying seats in the rooms 
and taking part in its proceedings was 
a sight to delight the gods. There 
were Flint, Warner, Alexander, 
Walker, Vena, Capt. Hawkins, Whitley, 
Troy, Bernard, B. W. Sikes and others 
of the old guard. These were re-en- 
forced by Editor T. A. Greene of the 
Enterprise, Lieut. Colonel Allens* 
worth, Capt. F. H. Crumbley, Lieut 
Williams, W. E. Easton, Willis Jack- 
son, a bright man from Missouri, 
a score or more bright men whose 
presence has added intelligence 
and wealth to the city. With 
a regenerated look a few mem¬ 
bers of the old “six bits push 
occupied seats in the hall and mani¬ 
fested in many ways a desire to 
amend for past prodigalities. The 
Pasadena members have also repented 
in sackcloth and ashes and will be 
given the right hand of fellowship. 
Race unity for the present and future 
demands that past political mistakes 
he forgotten, and the race present a 
united front to the foes of its rights. 

TAXATION WITHOUT REPRE¬ 
SENTATION. 

We have in this city a population of 
10,000 to 12,000 with 2,000 to 3,000 
voters paying taxes on two and a half 
millions dollars worth of real and per¬ 
sonal property. We have many busi¬ 
ness and professional men and women 
with 4000 homes and hundreds of 
thousands invested in the city s 
business life. With the property 
above mentioned and 10,000 citi¬ 
zens, 75 per cent of whom can read 
and write and the political balance of 
power in the Sixth and Seventh wards, 
the Afro-Americans have no represent¬ 
ation or voice in the administration of 
the city’s affairs. They hold not a 
single position of honor and trust. So 
far as having a voice in public affairs, 
the colored voters are as completely 
disfranchised as they are in the South. 
And to add to the shame of the whole 
business, is the fact that the colored 
people in no city in this country can 
boast of a finer array of talent. There 
are lawyers, doctors, newspaper men, 


soldiers, printers, merchants, chemists, 
tailors, real estate men and women, 
capitalists, orators and statesmen out 
of jobs. Here is taxation without rep¬ 
resentation with a vengeance. Here 
is sneaking disfranchisement that 
would make Vardanian green with 
envy. What a model Republican city. 
What are you to do about it, colored 
voters? 

The remedy is to organize now and 
open a campaign to secure the nomin¬ 
ation of a colored man for councilman 
and one member of the school board. 
In the coming city campaign there will 
probably be six or seven tickets in 
the field. If a place on one or the 
other of these tickets cannot be se¬ 
cured, let the colored voters run inde¬ 
pendent candidates for councilmen 
in the Sixth and Seventh wards, and 
run one or more candidates for mem¬ 
bers of the school board. In view of 
the spirit of “jim crowism” in our city 
schools the colored voters should have 
representation on the school board to 
look after the interest of the colored 
children. The placing of an independ¬ 
ent ticket in the field by the colored 
voters would so confuse things that 
they would be almost certain to sec ire 
representation. And such a move 
would teach the bosses a wholesome 
lesson and secure manly consideration 
for the colored voters in the future. 
Remember the treatment accorded the 
colored delegats at Venice. Eight hun¬ 
dred white Republicans allowed the 
15 colored ones to go without dinnr 
and be insulted for being black Re¬ 
publicans. The fact is the negroes 
were not wanted, and if there is a 
spark of manhood left in them they 
will keep away from people that don’t 
want them. 


Mob Law Must Go. 

THE LYNCHING SYSTEM OF 
MURDER. 

Of all the abhorrent forms of mur¬ 
der, lynching is the most brutal and 
cowardly. That it is all this and 
more, no man can deny. Lynching is 
the taking of human life without war¬ 
rant of' law. It is the extreme of 
cruelty. It has all the damning acces¬ 
sories of premeditation and malice 
aforethought, and it is so dastardly as 
to be unworthy of a skulking coyote. 

This foul and un-American practice’ 
is none the less inexcusable because it 
is confined to the killing of negroes. 
In fact it is all the worse for that. If 
white men were as regularly lynched, 
when they either commit crimes or 
are merely suspected of them, and no 
discrimination made on account of 
color, the thing would not look so bad. 

The lynching which took place at 
Charlottesville. N. C., on Monday last, 
is a samnle of nearly all. Three ne¬ 
groes, against whom nothing had been 


proven, were taken forcibly from jail 
and the custody of the law, hung to a 
tree and riddled with bullets. Some¬ 
times the custom is varied by burning 
the victims at the stake. Whether or 
not the persons who were lynched 
were guilty of the crime of which they 
were suspected no one knows, and it is 
doubtful if any of the lynchers care. 
But the men who strung those help¬ 
less human beings to a tree and shot 
them were themselves murderers, pure 
and simple. 

Every Man Has a Right to Trial by 
Jury. 

No excuse can or should be made 
for negroes, or white men, either, who 
commit crimes. B it all men stand 
equal before the law of the United 
States. Every man has the right to be 
tried by a jury of his peers. The lynch¬ 
ers destroy that right. 

It is not to be wondered at, per¬ 
haps, that the good, true men of the 
neg^o r?ce in America grow discour¬ 
aged and disheartened in the face of 
constantly recurring instances like this 
one at Charlottesville. When the negro 
says he is not given a square deal, that 
his rights are not respected and that 
he is the prey of brutes who, because 
their skins are white, hound and per¬ 
secute and slay him at will, what 
answer can be given? 

Yet there must sometime be an end 
to this sort of infamy. There must 
come a time when the negro will not 
be denied the protection of the laws. 
Not only has the Constitution guaran¬ 
teed that protection to him, but he has 
earned it. himself, a million times 
over, by bis sacrifices, his good con- 
d ict. and his progress along the-linos 
of civilization and humanity. The 
American negroes as a class, have no 
reason to be ashamed of themselves 
today. It is a pity and a shame that 
the nation tolerates the abuses and the 
outrages that are being heaped upon 
them and which they are obliged to 
suffer. 

Whoever has a voice, let him raise 
it in the negro’s behalf. Whoever they 
may be who sit in the seats of the 
mighty, let them wipe from the na¬ 
tion’s escutcheon this awful disgrace. 
—The Times. 


WANTED AT ONCE. 

Every young colored man to join the 
colored Y. M. C. A. . For Christian 
training and the fitting of young men 
for lives of usefulness the Y. M. C. A. 
is one of the cheapest and best insti¬ 
tutions in the country. The young man 
who starts on life’s journey without a 
Christian education is a soldier in bat¬ 
tle without ammunition. The men of 
the future must be trained now.

A Ringing Appeal to the 
Country. 

Address Issued to Country by Niagara 
Movement Says Race Is Not More 
Lawless Than White, but Is More 
Often Mobbed—Republican Party 
Accused. 

Harper's Perry, W. Va„ Aug. 19 — 
The second annual meeting of the Ni¬ 
agara movement came to a close today 
'"’th religious exercises and a sermon 
by Rev. G. Frazier Miller. At the con¬ 
clusion ct the sermon, an addiess to 
the country was read. It says in part- 
Address to the country: The men 
of the Niagara movement coming from 
the toil of the years of hard work and 
pausing a moment from the earning 
ot their daily bread turn toward the 
nation and again ask in the name of 
10,000,000 the privilege of a hearing, 
In the past year the work of the negro 
has flourished in the land. Stripped of 
subterfuge and in its naked nastiness 
t e new Amer.caa creed says: ‘Fear 
to let black men even try to rise lest 
t: «y become the equals of the white’ 

In detail our demands are clear and 
unequivocal. First, we would vote; 
v, th the right to vote goes everything 
— .ieedcm, manhood, the honor of yo ir 
views the chastity of your daughters 
and the right to work and the chance 
to use, and let no man listen to the 
l ars wl-o deny this. We want full 
manhood suffrage; and we want it 
now, henceforth and forever 
"Second, we want discrimination in 
public accommodations to cease Sep¬ 
aration in railway and street cars 
ba sed simply on race and color, is un- 
American, un-Democratic and sfllv TT /o 
rr .^, s . t f, " ainst 311 such discrimination. 

Third, we claim the right of free 
men to walk, talk and be w..., th-m 
that wish to be with us. No man has 
n right to choose another man’s friends 
and to attempt to do so is an impudent 
interference with the most fundamen¬ 
tal human privilege. 


The failure of the Republican party 
in congress at the session just closed 
to redeem its pledge of 1904 with ref¬ 
erence to suffrage conditions in the 
South seems a plain, deliberate and 
premeditated breach of promise, and 
stamps that party as guilty of obtain- 
m «tr.^ r,teS llnder false pretense. 

Fifth, we want the national govern¬ 
ment to wipe out illiteracy in the 
Bcufh. We want our children trained 
as intelligent human beings should be 
and we will fight for all time against 
any proposal to educate black boys and 
girls simply as servants and under- 

po(ffle ° r simi:>Iy for tile use °f other 

“These are some.of the chief things 
which we want. How shall we get 
them? By voting where we may vote. 
<y persistent, unceasing agitation by 
hammering at the truth, by sacrifice 
and work.

on the scene of John Brown’s martyr¬ 
dom we reconsecrate ourselves our 
' , Dn °r> our Property, to the final eman¬ 
cipation of the race which John Brown 
died to make free.” 

The address closes with an appeal 
to the young men and women of the 
nation and asks: “Cannot the nation 
that has absorbed 10,000,000 foreigners 
into its political life without catas¬ 
trophe absorb 10,000,000 negro Ameri¬ 
cans into that same political life at 
less cost than their unjust and illegal 
exclusion will involve?” 


Wants Discriminations to Caase. 

“Fourth, we want the laws enforced 
against the rich as well as the poor, 
against capitalist as well as laborer•’ 
against white as well as black. We 
are not more law,less than the white 
race, but we are more often arrested 
convicted and mobbed. We want jus¬ 
tice, even for criminals and outlaws 
we want the constitution of the coun- 
Gy enforced. We want congress to 
take charge of congressional elections 
We want the fourteenth amendment 
carried out to the letter and every 
state disfranchised in congress which 
attempts to disfranchise its rightful 
voters. We want the fifteenth amend¬ 
ment enforced and no state allowed to 
base its franchise simply on color

WILL THE NEGRO THINK. 

With a Republican President, a Re¬ 
publican Congress and a United States 
Supreme Court, with a Republican ma¬ 
jority, with the army and navy Repub¬ 
licans, the colored American is told 
that he cannot be protected in his po- 
litical rights. Since this is an estab- 
hshed fact, what use is there to keep 
Republicans in office? Why should 
the colored man north continue to vote 
to keep men in power who cannot pro- 
tect him? It is admitted that the above 
conditions exist, so why should the col- 
Qi Q e f Q V °i :ei oontlnue to be the willing

for him to go to the Democratic party

ress and human rights. Will the col¬ 
or ‘it™* 1 u laV ?v n0 sense? Just think 
1 Htis the colored voter ever 
stopped to consider his condition and 

not 1J0 ^ er that his supposed friends 
possess? A change in the political at¬ 
mosphere could not affect the colored 
man any more than he is now effected 
it is not understood that The Bee 
means for the colored voter to go over 
lo the Democratic party. But It does 
mean for him to support men, be they 
Democrats or red (Jevils, who will give 
him his political and civil rights.

THE TIMES AND THE LYNCHING 
EVIL. 


picked up in low crap dives. Wherever 
he appears as a man he is written up 
as a monkey. In short, no opportunity 
is lost to create universal contempt 
for the negro and hights locally. If 
the negro’s name is mentioned in con¬ 
nection with a crime, the reporter 
jumps to the conclusion that he is 
guilty, and proceeds to sentence him 
without further ceremony. Some time 
ago a white man’s house was burned, 
and as be had had some trouble with 
a colored neighbor, the Times stated 
that the house had been burned by ne¬ 
groes. The Examiner said that the 
police did not know who burned the 
house, which proved to be true. A 
white girl whom some white man had 
made drunk and then did God knows 
what else, called at a colored man’s 
door for aid, which was given in a 
true Christian spirit. For this, the 
Times charged the negro with keeping 
a house for enticing white girls to 
ruin. On another occasion a half 
column was used telling how a burly 
negro with a big. revolver was raping 
defenseless white women out on Santa 
Fe avenue, forcing them to keep the 
hellish secret by threatening death for 
betrayal. When brought into court 
the women swore tbat the Times’ 
charges were false. In each case the 
truth could have been had just for the 
asking. But the truth was not wanted. 
Now this is the same policy pursued 
by the daily papers in Charlott, N. C., 
and in all places both north and south 
where there is a desire to appeal to 
the mob and stir up race animosities. 
And wherever such a narrow, short¬ 
sighted policy is pursued by the press 
the negro is ultimately denied his 
rights, mob law prevails, justice takes 


and popular with all classes. He al¬ 
ready has the endorsement of the 
Afro-American League, which will be 
followed by all of the colored organ¬ 
izations in the. city and county. 

He is honest and capable. 


JUDGE YORK. 

The defeat of Judge York for renom¬ 
ination for the Superior bench has 
justly incensed the voters, regardless 
of parties. Judge York is one of the 
ablest, purist jurists on the bench, 
whose services to the people have 
been so well appreciated that he has 
always run ahead of his ticket. 

If the present law requires the nom¬ 
ination of judges of the Appellate 
court by petition. Judge York will be 
placed on the Appellate ticket and 
overwhelmingly elected. He has the 
confidence and sympathy of the people, 
who will rally to his support whenever 
the opportunity presents itself. There 
ought to be an amendment to the 
State constitution requiring the nomin¬ 
ation of all judges by petition. This 
would take .the judiciary out of the 
hands of the machine politicians. The 
judiciary is the one department of all 
others that the people should endeavor 
to keep clean and above suspicion.

In the declaration of those negroes 
who make up what is called the Ni¬

there is contained more of promise for

“ The failure of the Republican party

When the negroes of this' country 
shall awaken to the fact that the en¬ 
tile policy of the Republican party for 
the past quarter of a century relative 
to the black man has been one of hol¬ 
low pretense, plain and deliberate then 
they shall begin to realize that the idol 
ujjon which they have leaned politic¬ 
ally has at no time been honest in its

lished elsewhere in these columns is 

strong, manly and uncompromising. 
I he negro is an American citizen and 
must battle to the death if need be 
tor every right guaranteed citizens by 
the constitution. The right to vote and 
vote as lle Pleases, to get whatever he 
pays for, to ride where he pleases 
when he meets the requiremnts, such 
a ® a J. e demanded of other citizens, to 
associate with those who wish to as¬ 
sociate with him, are rights that no 
American citizen should consent to 
relinquish. The negro asks for the en- 
forcement of the Federal constitution 
and amendments. Can’t the white 
people live up to their own laws?

Wanted—Our business and profession¬ 
al people to get together and father and 
promote enterprises for the employment 
of young folks. If our college-trained 
men and women cannot get together for 
the advancement of the race, whither 
.are we drifting? 

Wanted—At once; an Afro-American 
daily paper published in this city. While 
the paper need not be as large as the 
Times and Examiner, it would do more 
good in manufacturing sentiments in fa¬ 
vor of a “square deal” for our people 
than all of the white papers in the city. 
The tendency of the daily papers to cir¬ 
culate damaging falsehoods against us 
is becoming too prevalent. With no ap¬ 
parent reason, some of our city dailies 
that have been friendly to us, are now 
molding sentiment against us.
