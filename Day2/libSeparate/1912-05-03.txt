Dr. James E. Shepard Greeted by a Great 
Outpouring: of the People 



Dr. James E. Shepard 

Wesley Chapel never had a more 
representative audience than the 
one which packed its spacious 
auditorium last Monday evening, 
to hear and pay homage to Dr. 
James E. Shepard, the distinguished 
educator and orator. Although an 
orator of high rank, Dr. Shepard 
wasted no time in that direction, 
but made an argument in favor 
of a Christian education, supple¬ 
mented by facts and illustrations 
which fell like a great light upon his 
audience, bringing to its vision 
many new and beautiful scenes. 

Discussing education, based upon 
industrialism, he showed how little 
of real worth a hundred blacksmiths 
would be to the spiritual uplift 
of a community. To be what they 


ought to be, they should be fitted 
for something higher than hammer¬ 
ing iron. 

He told how the mighty king¬ 
dom of Egypt, based upon material¬ 
ism, was enjoying great prosperity 
10,000 years before history was 
born; and yet there is not a man 
in that country to-day, that the 
people will trust with leadership. 
So fleeting is materialism that the 
power of Egypt has so completely 
vanished that that country is ruled 
by foreigners. 

Rome and Greece were both 
used as illustrations of the muta¬ 
bility of nations whose education 
failed to recognize Christianity as 
a necessary asset. 

The Christian training of the 
Jews was used in contrast to the 
nations who knew not such train¬ 
ing. Though claiming no national 
existence, the Jews are financing 
the nations of the earth. 

The Christian training having 
preserved the Jewish race down 
trough ages, it will do the same 
thing for our race. We have too 
much waste material in the jails 
and chain gangs. If this material 
is to be preserved, our youths will 
to be given a Christian training. 

He made a strong appeal to 
the young people, to respect the 
religion of their fathers and mothers; 
telling how religion had sustained 
them through the long years of 
slavery, finally delivering them 
from the house of bondage. 

His tribute to the bible was a 
masterpiece of eloquence, which 
gave that grand old book of books 


a warmer place in the bosom of 
his hearers. 

He sharply criticised the tendency 
shown by some members of the 
race to lose interest in its well-fare 
as soon as they accumulated a 
little wealth,” This tendency with 
a lack of self-control, constitutes 
a peril, and until the lessons of 
self control are learned, our race 
has about as much as it can safely 
handle.” 

It was a great speech, the greatest 
of the kind ever delivered to a 
colored audience in this city. It 
literally sparkled throughout with 
gems of thought, full of enthusiasm 
hope and inspiration. He dealt 
with the emotional side of some 
Negro’s religion showing its in¬ 
consistencies and its failures, when 
it touches the business side of life 
His description of some of the 
antics of emotional religion, as 
practiced by some of our people, 
created considerable amusement. 

Dr. Shepard is one of the key men 
of the race and is rendering a 
service of inestimable value to 
the Negroes, and deserves their 
loyal support everywhere. His 
school at Durham, N. C., is turn¬ 
ing out ministers of the gospel 
fully equipped for the work of 
race up-lift. The demands upon 
his school for trained young women 
to engage in settlement work in 
the big cities is greater than the 
supply. It is the -duty—an im¬ 
perative duty— of the colored 
people, everywhere, to aid Dr. 
Shepard’s school, as there is a 
rapidly growing need for his grad¬ 
uates wherever Negroes live in

any considerable numbers. Dr. 
Shepard not only deserves the 
support of the Negroes, but the 
support of the white poeple as 
well; for his work for the uplift 
of the man at the bottom, must 
make stronger the man at the top. 
The interests of the white and' 
black races in this country are so 
interwoven, that they must ad¬ 
vance or retrograde together. 

There ought to be some way to 
keep Dr. Shepard on the lecture 
platform, as he is too big a man 
to be confined to any single local¬ 
ity. Plis wholesome, inspiring talks 
should be heard everywhere by 
everybody. 


COLORED CITIZENS REJECT 
PROPOSAL OF BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS 


A mass meeting of colored citi¬ 
zens was held last Friday night, 
19th inst., at the New Hope Bap¬ 
tist Church, Paloma street, at 
which there were several speakers 
and it was declared undemocratic 
and unjust to discriminate between 
applicants for admission to the 
training school for nurses at the 
County Hospital, because of color. 

The speakers included Dr. A. 
C. Garrott, Eugene Walker, Rev. 
C. H. Anderson, Charles Alexander, 
J, W. Palmer, presided, j 

Resolutions were passed condemn¬ 
ing the proposing on the part of 
the Board of Supervisors, for the 
use of the County’s funds for es¬ 
tablishing a separate home or build¬ 
ing for housing any particular class 
of nurses or applicants for admis¬ 
sion to the training school, of said 
institution, because of race, color, 
or crede. Resolutions were also 
passed expressing sympathy for 
relatives and friends of those who 
perished in the recent Titanic 
disaster. 


RESOLUTIONS 


WHEREAS, the Board of Sup¬ 
ervisors of Los Angeles County 


has encouraged discrimination at 
the County Hospital, by refusing 
to admit qualified young women 
to the nurses’ training school at 
the said hospital, because of color, 
and 

WHEREAS, the said Board of 
Supervisors did, on the first day 
of April, 1912, make an order author¬ 
izing provision to be made in the 
next tax levy for the construction 
of a separate building to house the 
colored applicants that may be 
admitted to said training school, 
and 

WHEREAS, such separate build¬ 
ing or institution would not be pat¬ 
ronized or used by our young wo¬ 
men, and the erection or establish¬ 
ment of the same would be a wanton 
waste of the public funds, there¬ 
fore, 

BE IT RESOLVED: that, as 
citizens of Los Angeles County ,we 
in public mass meeting, held at New 
Hope Baptist Church, in Los An¬ 
geles, do protest against the action 
of the Board of Supervisors in 
refusing to admit colored women 
to enjoy the privileges offered for 
training of nurses at the said hos¬ 
pital, and that we urge that the 
said Board right this wrong, and 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: 
that, as citizens and taxpayers, we 
condemn any plan for the use of 
this county’s funds for the purpose 
of establishing any separate build¬ 
ing or for making any provision for 
the accomodation of any particu¬ 
lar class of young women, on the 
ground of race or color; and that 
we urge that every lawful and just 
means be used to bring about the 
opening of the doors of said train¬ 
ing school to all applicants on 
exactly the same conditions; and 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: 
that copies of these resolutions 
be sent to the Board of Supervisors 
and to the press. 

Dated April 19, 1912.

Another sad feature in this con¬ 
nection is that in that awful slaugh¬ 
ter and the indescribable torture 
with which many of the chained 
victims were put to death, the 
white pulpit and press of the country 
have maintained an absolute silence, 
so far as condemning these crimes 
went. This silence has cost 
dearly in cheapening human life. As 
a result, life is cheaper in the 
United States than in any other 
civilized country on the face of 
the earth. 

In arousing public sentiment 
against this national disgrace, the 
National Association for the Ad- 
cancement of the Colored Poeple 
is rendering to humanity and the 
country a lasting service. This 
Association is made up of some of 
the leading white and colored men 
and women of the country which 
goes to show that patriotism is 
not wholly dead. 

Even the Southern people are 
beginning to realize the deadly 
effect of the mob upon the well 
being of that section. 

The day is breaking. 


2,600 AMERICAN CITIZENS 
SLAUGHTERED 

The ruthless murder of something 
like 3,000 American citizens of 
color by mobs in the past 26 years, 
forms a dark, bloody page in Ameri¬ 
can history, that will require many 
centuries of law enforcement to 
brighten. There can be no excuse 
offered in extenuation for that 
wholesale slaughter of defenseless 
men, women and children. The 
fact that not one of the murderers 
of these victims has been punished 
makes a record more hidious than 
the crimes themselves, showing 
as they do, the depths to which 
public morals have sunk. 


A CRY FOR JUSTICE 


Lynching, which is a defiance 
of law and a relic of barbarism, 
must be stamped out in these 
United States if we are to maintain 
our proud position among the 
nations. According to the National 
Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People in the last twenty- 
six years 2548 negroes have been 
lynched and not one lyncher has 
ever been punished. The shame 
of these lawless outbreaks rests 
on the shoulders of the nation. 

Our colored fellow-citizens have 
a right to raise a cry for justice, 
and the white race has a duty to 
see that they receive it. We trust 
that some practical results will 
spring from the three days deliber¬ 
ation that has been arranged to 
take place in Chicago by a joint 
conference of the races. While 
we Americans are always ready to 
help the oppressed in other coun¬ 
tries we sometimes seem singularly 
lax in remedying abuses in our own. 

The L. A. Times 


PUBLIC RECEPTION TENDER¬ 
ED HON. THEODORE W. 
JONES 


The public reception tendered 
Hon. Theodore W. Jones was a 
brilliant affair and was attended 
by a large crowd. His speech gave 
added inspiration to the one deliv¬ 
ered on the previous occasion. 
As a speaker, Mr. Jones makes an 
impression upon his hearers that 
they are not willing to shale off. 
He is a silent man but when he 
breaks silence every body listens 
eagerly. 

Mr. Jones is highly pleased with 
this city and its citizens. He 
thinks that our people are doing 
well; is much impressed with the 
number and attractiveness of their 
homes. Owing to Southern Calif¬ 
ornia's matchless climate, Mr. 
Jones may spend his winters here. 

He thinks the Lyceum a splendid 
organization and doing a good work 
in the dissiminating information 
derived through lectures. 

The officers of the Lyceum are 
being congratulated by visitors and 
members of the organization upon 
the character and ability of the 
speakers that have been secured. 
The record will be kept up and the 
work of educating the people will 
go right on. Every question before 
the American people will be dis¬ 
cussed by speakers of ability, both 
men and women, white and black. 
Especial attention will be given 
to the discussion of all local mat¬ 
ters, political and others. Per¬ 
sons who want information will 
do well to attend these meetings. 
They are open to all, free, and are 
conducted simply for the benefit 
of all of the people.

THE TOILER 


Smokeless towers and silent wheels, 
Today on the lonely hill, 

And the restless hands are folded, 
And the tireless heart is still. 
The eyes that pierced the darkness 
Of the very earth are dim, 

And of all his wide dominions 
There's only a grave for him. 

He walked where ever the toiler 
Had shapen his sturdy tread 
When the scented way of the roses 
Was his, if he cared, instead. 

And wherefore hath he striven 
If not for gold and gain? 

Did he fashion his wheels of iron 
For torture and human pain? 
Answer, oh lips that tremble! 

Answer, oh tearful eyes! 

That ask God's peace and blessing 
Upon him where he lies. 

Yea, 'twas for you, my brothers, 
With tireless brain he strove, 
And the smoke from his grimy 
towers 

* Was the incense of his love. 

And after the weary struggle 
No curse falls on his head, 

No trail of blood to tarnish 
The blameless life he led. 

Peace and farewell:, oh toiler! 

God grant that some day shall see 


This sad old world as happy 
As your dreams would have it be.
