this time he also announces that 
we ought to destroy the two-term 
President and leave the President 
open to as many return engage¬ 
ments as he may desire. I have 
tried to get him to tell how many 
terms he thinks a President ought 
to have, and the nearest I have 
come to it was at Denver the other 
day when he went far enough to 
say if it was not a consecutive 
term then that none of the argu¬ 
ments against a third term would 
lie. What a pity Grant didn’t 
know that! How conclusive it 
would have been when Grant 
wanted a third term undei condi¬ 
tions identical with Mr. Roose¬ 
velts demand. And yet Grant, 
though the leader of the armies in 
the greatest war of history, was 
denied a third term by the very 
party in which a majority of the 
soldiers were Avho followed him in 
that war. But Mr. Roosevelt 
just brushes it aside and says these 
arguments don’t lie if a man has 
been to Africa in the meantime. 
(Laughter.) 

Against this plan of an unlimited 
Presidency, whether consecutive 
or of the leap-frog variety, I pre¬ 
sent the traditions of a hundred 
years—of W^ashington the fathei 
of his country; Jefferson who gave 
his name to the lovers of liberty 
of all time, and Jackson who saved 
the country from a bank conspiracy. 
Yet Mr. Roosevelt wants you to 
organize a new party in order to 
defy the precedents that have 
come down from Washington and 
from Jefferson. Will the people 
do it? (Cries of “No, no, no.”) 
I can’t believe in the faith of a 
President weighed in the balance 
and found wanting, in the faith 
of another President who has re¬ 
ceived all the honors that any 
American ought to desire, and who 
today stands for two doctrines 
that must be repugnant to the 
conscience oi a vast majority of 
our people—I cannot believe that 
the people will endorse his posi¬ 
tion on trusts nor his position on 
the third term.” 

The President’s Great Power. 

“The President has more power 


in. his hand than any King, or 
Czar, or Emporer. Hundreds of 
thousands of men hang for employ¬ 
ment upon his word. He is com¬ 
mander-in-chief of the army and 
the navy. No battleship can turn 
its prow to the ocean without his 
command, and no soldier of Uncle 
Sam can forward march without 
his order. When a frail human 
being so weak as men are in the 
presence of temptations, when a 
frail human being is elevated to 
this supreme pinnacle of power, 
he should tear from his breast 
every shred of ambition, and on 
his bended knees consecrate his 
term to his country’s service with 
no selfish purpose to blind his 
eyes or pervert his j udgement. 
(Appaluse.) That is our idea 
of the Presidency. Is it too big 
for the American people? Is it 
not time for us to recognize that 
the President is the greatest official 
in the world, and so hedge him 
about that when he retires from 
office he can feel that he has lived 
up to the very letter as well as 
to the spirit of the oath that he 
takes upon himself? It is a great 
campaign. Great issues are at 
stake. And I consider it a great 
privilege to represent my party 
and plead with you to give Calif¬ 
ornia’s vote to Wilson and to 
Marshall. (Appluase, cheers.) 


MULATTOS INCREASING RAP¬ 
IDLY IN AMERICA 


WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.— 
A preliminary statement showing 
by states the Negro population in 
the United States and the propor¬ 
tion of mulattos to full-blooded 
Negroes has been issued by the 
Director of Census. 

The total is 9,827,763. Of this 
number 2,050,686 are set down as 
mulattos. The Negro popula¬ 
tion in 1870 was 4,880,000 with 
584,049 mulattos. In 1870 the 
mulattos were 12 per cent of the 
whole, while in 1910 it was prac¬ 
tically 21 per cent. 

Most of the increase has been in 
the Northern states. This, it is 
said, is not necessarily because of 
intermarriage between whites and 


Negroes, but is due largely to the 
natural increase that would come 
from the marriage of full-blooded 
Negroes to mulattos. 


RAGTIME NEEDED IN SCHOOL 
SAYS FRANCIS 


“There is not enough ragtime 
in our education!” declared J. 
H. Francis, superintendent of city 
schools, to 1500 teachers who as¬ 
sembled for the first official meet¬ 
ing of the year at Los Angeles high 
school this morning. 

Mr. Francis was given an ova¬ 
tion as he stepped on the stage. 
“I don’t mean by ragtime that our 
entertainment must be on a lower 
level,” he said. “But I mean a 
human, vitalizing touch that will 
teach children how to be joyous, 
constructive, efficient and hopeful. 

“You, as educators, must save 
souls to educate. Save them by 
cooking classes, or by typewriters, 
or by whatever will reach the human 
soul, and forget the course of study.” 

The general teacher’s meeting 
was preceded by a meeting of all 
city principals. 

All city schools will open Monday 
morning. Fifteen additional un¬ 
graded rooms will be opened Mon¬ 
day, with the ultimate object of 
having three or four in each in¬ 
termediate and high school. 

The school gardens will be in¬ 
creased to 100 this year, and the 
playgrounds and vocational work 
enlarged. 


STOPPED FIGHTIN’ TOO SOON 


At a Confederate Re-union held 
some years ago in Birmingham, 
Ala., at which ten thousand Con¬ 
federate veterans took part, an 
old Confederate veteran, standing 
on a street corner, surrounded 
by a crowd, was crying as if his 
heart would break. A young man 
attracted by the curious crowd 
stepped up to him and said: 

“What’s the matter Mr. are 
you hurt?” 

“No,” the old man replied. 

“Has anyone insulted you?” next 
inquired the stranger.

“No, by G—, they darsen’t 
to,” he replied. 

“Then what’s your trouble?” 

Pointing to the passing parade 
the old man said: “If I hader knowd 
that thar was that many of us 
rebels left, I woulder been figlitin’ 
yet?”

OLD FOLKS’ HOME FOR IN¬ 
DIGENT 


A movement significant as an 
attempt at racial betterment among 
colored people of Southern Calif¬ 
ornia is the opening yesterday of 
the Old Folk’s Home at Linwood 
tract, near Albia, in Los Angeles 
county. The home will house aged 
and indigent Negroes, who might 
become public charges, orphans, 
whose instruction will be looked 
after, and members of the minis¬ 
terial profession who have been 
retired. 

Two years ago five acres of 
land were bought for the home at 
a cost of $6,000. Rev. • Chester 
H. Anderson has been installed 
as superintendent. For twenty- 
five years he resided in Los Angeles 
as pastor of the Second Baptist 
Church, the oldest colored congre¬ 
gation in Southern California. 
Two years ago, when the church 
showed a membership of 700, 
mainly as a result of his efforts, 
he resigned and organized the New 
Hope Baptist Church, which now 
has 400 members. 

At the twenty-first annual ses¬ 
sion of the Western Baptist As¬ 
sociation, held recently at Pasa¬ 
dena, he was by unanimous vote 
chosen moderator of the associa¬ 
tion. 

He was later selected by the same 
body as financial agent to collect 
sums donated by friends of the 
colored race. Under his leadership 
the colored Baptists of the county 
are now making an effort to raise 
$3,500 for the erection of an ad¬ 
ditional building to care for indi¬ 
gent Negroes. This project is 
meeting with encouragement from 
philanthropic white citizens who 
are willing to assist in the effort 
toward the uplift of the race.

The Kicker Was Placated. 

“The plan to have number of 
leading colored men who have 
been training with the Progres¬ 
sives to meet Mr. Roosevelt had 
been carefully worked out by an 
astute race politician, but in order 
to placate a “kicker” was taken 
out his hands.” 

The Weekly Progress. 

The above paragraph from the 
Weekly Progress’ report of the 
interview between Col. Roosevelt 
and the colored delegation inti¬ 
mates that the plan of some “as¬ 
tute politician” was spolied. From 


the above statement the disap¬ 
pointed politician in spite of his 
astuteness amounts to nothing 
when brought in contact with a 
“kicker.”. From the paragraph 
quoted the “astute politician” in 
question intimates that after lying 
awake many nights planing to 
have certain gentlemen meet the 
Colonel that “a kicker” appeared 
upon the scene and in order to 
placate him, the kicker, the whole 
thing was put into the kicker’s 
hands. 

This is news to us and, if what 
the “astute politician” says, is 
true, he has our sympathy. In 
the meantime we would like to 
meet that “kicker” and have him 
infuse into our worn and weary 
body some of his energy that we 
might be enabled to kick some 
of our cheap grafters out of town. 

Let us have a few less “astute 
politicians” and more “kickers.” 

A Wanton Aspersion Cast Upon 
Mr. Avery. 

In his wail concerning the com- 
mitee that interviewed Col. Roose¬ 
velt, the editor of the New Age 
displayed considerable soreness. 
But from the following paragraph 
copied from that paper, viz: 

“It was announced that arrange¬ 
ments were all made and that 
Atty. Wickliffe had a set of ques¬ 
tions to offer and that they were 
presentable because Mr. Avery had 
seen a copy of them.” 
the spleen of the writer becomes 
evident. For the writer of the 
above paragraph knew, or could 
have known for the asking, that 
Mr. Avery not only did not see 
the address before it was delivered 
but did not even request that it 
be submitted to him. Mr. Avery 
is a gentleman of whole cloth and 
would not have humiliated the 
committee by making such a re¬ 
quest. The writer of the above 
paragraph in attempting to dis¬ 
credit Atty. Wickliffe has placed 
Mr. Avery in an embarrassing 
position. 

In view of the fact that Prof. 
W. E. Easton called at the office 
of Atty. Wickliffe on Tuesday 


morning after the interview, and 
was informed that Mr. Avery 
had not seen or heard the address 
until it was delivered to Col. 
Roosevelt would make it appear 
that there is a conspiracy on foot 
in that office to distort the facts. 

Farther on The New Age in¬ 
sults Col. Roosevelt and the Pro¬ 
gressive Committee by referring 
to the interview as a Jim Crow 
meeting. In view of the fact that 
the editor of the New Age was a 
party to the interview isn’t it 
a little strange that he would 
refer to it as a Jim Crow meeting? 


THAT “JULIAN HARRIS LET¬ 
TER” 

Since the publication in these 
columns of the able address de¬ 
livered to Col. Roosevelt by Atty. 
Wickliffe on behalf of the colored 
delegation that interviewed him, 
we have had numerous calls by 
both white and colored people 
for copies of the “Julian Harris 
letter.” We are pleased to an¬ 
nounce that we have about a 
thousand copies of that letter that 
were picked up after they had 
been thrown away, and appre¬ 
ciating their importance, we have 
them and will be glad to furnish 
a copy, so long as they last, to 
any person desiring one. 


“THE WAY TO GET RID OF 
CROOKEDNESS AND DIS¬ 
HONESTY IS TO EXPOSE IT.” 


On last Sunday we had . the 
honor of an introduction to a 
distinguished colored veteran from 
New Orleans, Louisiana. 

While holding our hand he said: 
“I have just read a copy of your 
paper, the Liberator 71 and I am 
certainly pleased with the work 
you are doing. Your position on 
dishonesty and crookedness among 
the Negroes deserves the support 
and encouragement of every well 
wisher of the race. It is hard 
to estimate the harm that comes 
to our race through the actions 
of the crooks among us. And 
I especially urge you people here 
to suppress the idle, law-breaking

Negro. The way to accomplish 
this result is to expose and frown 
upon this class.” 

He seemed greatly pleased when 
we informed him of the good work 
that the colored policemen were 
accomplishing along this line in 
the city. 

He said: “Don't worry because 
the evilly inclined speak ill of 
you. Simply strike the harder. 
The opportunities of a whole race 
should not be blasted by toler¬ 
ating the criminal element.” 


We feel very gratedul to friends, 
especially the ladies for the words 
of encouragement and financial 
aid that we have recently received 
from them. In a humble way 
we are serving them and the com¬ 
munity at large to the best of our 
ability. And it is indeed a source 
of great strength to be assured by 
them that our labors are neither 
in vain or wasted by lack of ap¬ 
preciation. Let every reader of 
this journal who feels thus to give 
us flowers while we live.
