THE LIBERATOR. 


PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AT 
HAMPTON, 

The following excerpts from the Pres¬ 
ident's recent speech at Hampton Normal 
and Industrial Institute contains some 
wholesome advice that if followed by 
the people, irrespective of race or creed, 

will lastingly benefit all: 

* * * 

He said in part: 

Now, the first thing upon whfch I 
wish to lay emphasis is that a school 
such as this, which strives to raise the 
colored man and colored wQman to make 
them better men and better women, bet¬ 
ter citizens, is pre-eminently in the in¬ 
terests of the white man. There is noth¬ 
ing that can be done better for the white 
man who is to live side by side with 
the colored man, than to train that col¬ 
ored man up to be a good citizen. The 
good man, who is a white man, by his 
presence is a benefit to every colored 
man in the community, and the safety 
of the white man is in having the colored 
man grow to be a good and decent man. 
From the standpoint of the white man, 
the safest and best thing that can hap¬ 
pen is to have the colored people around 
him become thrifty, industrious, home¬ 
makers and home-keepers, for you never 
yet had any quantity of criminals from 
a people or locality where the average 
type was the home-maker and the home- 
keeper. 

* * * 

So that from the standpoint of the 
white man, nothing better can be done 
than to give to the colored man that real 
education, that real training, which he 
gets here at Hampton and all similar in¬ 
stitutes. From the standpoint of the 
colored man, the real way to help him is 
to help him help himself. In the long 
run in this world, no human being can 
be carried. What this institution does 
is to train young men and women to 

walk by themselves. 

* * * 

The colored man who helps his race 
most is he who helps teach the members 
of his race how to conduct themselves 
with self-respect as hard-working, intel¬ 
ligent, law-abiding citizens. It is the 
humble virtues that count in the long 
run.” 

* * * 

No race, no nationality, ever really 
raises itself by the exhibition of genius 
in a few men; what counts is character, 
the character of the average man and 
the average woman. If we develop in 
the average colored citizen those quali¬ 


ties of character, of courage, of truth¬ 
fulness, of sense of obligation, of will¬ 
ingness to work, of desire to behave de¬ 
cently to those round about you, you 
have taken the longest and most effective 
step toward securing for the people of 
your own race their own self-respect and 
the respect of others, which will follow 
inevitably in the training of that self- 
respect. 

* * * 

EDUCATION PREVENTS CRIME. 

You have sent out from Hampton In¬ 
stitute in all something like six thousand 
graduates, and, if I remember rightly, 
there are but two of whom you have rec¬ 
ord who are criminals, and that fact is 
an all-sufficient answer to the blind peo¬ 
ple, who say that no good will come from 
educating the negro. So far is that 
from the truth that it may be said that 
the only real hope for the ngro, as well 
as for the white man, is in education, if 
only we understand the meaning of edu¬ 
cation in its proper sense. 

* * * 

It is often said that the true place 
for the negro is in industrial work. That 
is the place for the average negro. That 
is the true place for the average negro, 
and it is the true place of the average 
white man, and we will not get our civ¬ 
ilization upon a proper basis until we 
root out of the mind of the average man 
and of the average girl, of whatever 
color, the belief that to become a poor 
clerk is a better thing than being a first- 
class hand-worker, a first ?class mechanic 
or a first-class agricultural laborer. 

* * * 

I want to see the colored man share 
in the benefit of this movement, and he 
can share in it only by becoming the 
best kind of a hand-worker himself, and 
above all by becoming the hand-worker 
on the farm, for others first but ultimate¬ 
ly for himself. 

* * * 

The following should be read and re¬ 
read by every Afro-American, and put 
into every-day practice. The idle crimi¬ 
nal element among us must be sup¬ 
pressed. Although the holding of the 
whole race responsible for crimes of the 
few is theoretically wrong, it is true 
nevertheless that it is done. While this 
holding of all responsible for wrongs of 
a small element works a hardship upon 
the majority of our people, it will event¬ 
ually, by making each his brother’s keep¬ 
er, lift the race to a standard of moral¬ 
ity higher than any ever attained by the 


whole race. Roosevelt continues : 

The negro criminal, no matter at whose 
expense the particular crime may be 
committed, is a hundred-fold more dan¬ 
gerous to the negro- race than to the 
white, because it tends to arouse the bit¬ 
ter animosities, the bitter prejudices for 
which, not he alone, but the whole race, 
will suffer. In the interests of the col¬ 
ored folks, see to it, you colored men 
here, that you war against criminality 
in your own race with a particular zeal, 
because that criminality is in the ultimate 
analysis a greater danger to your race 
than any other thing can be. I ask that 
you colored people show the same virtues 
which white people must show if they 
are to become good citizens. I ask you 
to remember that it is a good thing to 
have a trained mind; that it is a better 
thing to have a trained body, which if 
worked under the direction of a trained 
mind, and that better than either, mind 
or body. 


“JIM CROW” CLAUSE STRICKEN 
OUT. 

The Hepburn Rate Bill is having a 
hard time of it in conference. The “Jim 
Crow” reference in the measure has 
been stricken out in deference to the 
wishes of the colored people of the 
North. It was a virtual recognition of 
the separation of the races on the rail¬ 
roads and had a tendency to nationalize 
this practice. 

The provision might have benefited us 
of the Southland to a slight extent, by 
giving us better railroad accommodations 
on some of the lines in this section, but 
the provision to accomplish this was 
“like accommodations” rather than the 
one “equally as good.” The latter clause 
is susceptible to no end of construction. 
The former is specific and would cause 
the railroad companies to furnish dupli¬ 
cate cars for the races. 

We think that the elimination of the 
“equally as good” clause was wise. The 
United States Supreme Court has al¬ 
ready construed the separate car provi¬ 
sions to mean that equally as good ser¬ 
vice shall be furnished. We are not to 
receive what the law allots us, and we 
are learning to “pocket our pride 1 ’ and 
“bottle our indignation” while taking 
“pot luck” with that element of colored 
folks who are begrimed and dirty in their 
efforts to do the white folks' work.—

A NEGRO-HATER GONE. 

The death of Senator Arthur Pue Gor¬ 
man removes from the arena of public 
life one of the most inveterate and dan¬ 
gerous enemies the colored people had 
in all of this land. He was skilled in 
parliamentary debate and political trick¬ 
ery. His attempt to absolutely disfran¬ 
chise the colored people of Maryland was 
only partially successful and resulted in 
the split of his own party. 

He has gone to his reward, and yet 
we feel no resentment in the premises. 
He hns suffered much and no doubt 
atoned to some extent at least for the 
great injury he did to us. Our people 
are forgiving and forgetful, and even 
now they bow their heads in respectful 
silence, as all that is left of this Demo¬ 
cratic chieftain is on its way to the tomb. 

Politically speaking, we are well-nigh 
helpless, but God is raising up new white 
friends for us and taking our enemies 
away, where they can harm us no more 
in this world and do us no injury in 
the world to come. 

Brilliant, resourceful, scheming, per¬ 
sistent, Arthur Pue Gorman is now sleep¬ 
ing his last sleep. We shall do naught 
to stay his downward transit to the 
tomb .—Richmond Planet. 


MOB MURDERING. 

The Ivnching and burning enormity at 
Springfield, Mo., adds to its other awful 
features the legal finding that two of the 
negroes killed and roasted by the mob 
could not have been guilty of the offense 
charged. It is the verdict of the grand 
jury, after a long and thorough investi¬ 
gation, that two negroes slaughtered for 
an alleged assault were at work at a place 
at least a mile distant at the time. The 
third negro lynched was in jail on the 
charge of murder, and was killed by the 
mob as an afterthought when its wild 
passions were fully aroused. It is one of 
the most terrible outrages ever commit¬ 
ted by bloodthirsty lawbreakers in the 
whole history of civilized society. 

In its report the grand jury says the 
lynching was without reason or excuse, 
as well as unjustifiable and unlawful, 
and that the lynchers, largely composed 
of irresponsible and drunken men. took 
advantage of the occasion to commit acts 
of lawlessness that were absolutely bar¬ 
barous and fiendish, and these acts were 
nothin? more nor less than the outward 
exhibition of their real inward criminal- 
ity.” Many indictments have been found, 
and there is hope of retribution for this 
shedding of innocent blood and orgy of 
cruelty.—St. Louis Globe-Democrat. 


Moore & Burnett Co. (undertakers) 
have been adding considerable to their 
equipage of late. 

The latest purchases being an excellent 
pair of black horses for which they paid 
$500; a set of harness, $150; and a new 
buggy which cost $96.50. These men are 


making no noise about their business, but 
are going right ahead with a determina¬ 
tion and zeal which shows them to be 
men of business. Such confidence, when 
backed by good manners and gentlemanly 
demeanor, can not fail to win in the end. 

They now have the finest team in the 
city—also the finest floral wagon and 
funeral car. That speaks well for them 
when it is considered that there are six¬ 
teen white undertakers in thi« city. 

The total cost of their rolling stock 
and horses amounts to $4046.50. Even 
with this, there are those of our race 
who can not see the propriety of patron¬ 
izing colored men. 

Some of our people have sickness in 
their houses and become destitute to the 
extent that they have to call on friends 
for food and medicine, yet when death 
occurs, they are the first to find fault 
with their own undertakers. 

People who beg for sustenance should 
only beg of those whom they expect to 
patronise when they get monev of their 
own. If they had to pay a preacher for 
attending a funeral then they would dis¬ 
cover that negro preachers are no good, 
but as it is, they use the negro preacher, 
organist, choir, nurses, and all else who 
make no charges, but if a dollar is to be 
spent they run to those whom they would 
be afraid to call in case of sickness. The 
preachers have a splendid opportunity to 
teach these people to be consistent, if not 
honest. 


THE LOGAN MURDER MYSTERY. 

The arrest of J. C. C. Jaxon, charged 
with the murder of James Logan on the 
18th of May last, occasioned no sur¬ 
prise, as he was strongly suspected of 
having guiltv knowledge of the crime. 
While there is strong circumstantial evi¬ 
dence against Jaxon, v^e still believe that 
the murder was committed by white men. 
Jaxon may have assisted in the bloody 
deed, but he was not the principal. How 
an Afro-American could have even wit¬ 
nessed such a cold-blooded inhuman 
butchery, if such is the case, we are at 
a loss to understand. If Jaxon pos¬ 
sesses a guilty knowledge of the cow¬ 
ardly, dastardly deed, we trust that the 
chain of evidence against him will be 
made strong enough to convict him and 
make it possible to get the principals, 
whom we believe are still at large and 
perhaps enjoving the freedom of this 
community. Marshal Reid is leaving 
nothing undone to run down the murder¬ 
ers, and should be amply rewarded 
should he succeed in unraveling the mys¬ 
tery and bring them to justice. The citi¬ 
zens, irrespective of race, in Pasadena 
and South Pasadena should make the re¬ 
ward large enough to run the murder¬ 
ers off the earth. It was a crime against 
society—one so heartless, fiendish and 
brutal that the entire community is ap~ 
palled. The hopeless, miserable gang 
that decoyed Logan to a lonely spot on 
the Raymond golf links and deliberately 
butchered him with long, cruel knives, 
may escape the penalty of the law, but 


they will spend the rest of their existence 
in a relentless hell of their own creation. 
Logan’s appeals for mercy will evermore 
ring in their ears. The desperate, bloody 
death struggle in all of its ghastliness 
is still on. Logan’s troubles are over; 
theirs have just commenced; and in less 
than five years his ghost will have put 
them all in the graves of suicides or 
dope fiends. We have witnessed the hor¬ 
rible ending of several cold-blooded mur¬ 
derers. We have seen them chased into 
the grave by the unseen. Their awful 
fate is sealed. They cannot escape. 


The marriage .of Mr. C. E. A. Bronson 
and Miss Selena McDonald, both popu¬ 
lar young people, will be celebrated on 
the 27th of Jiine. Mr. Bronson is one of 
the most prosperous young men in Santa 
Monica. He owns some valuable real 
estate including a nice cottage which he 
has built for his bride. We extend to 
both our congratulations. 

* * * 

Dr. A. C. Garrott and brother, H. L. f 
have just returned from a week’s vaca¬ 
tion at Catalina Island. The doctor, who 
has been greatly overworked, returned 
greatly improved in health. 

* * * 

DEATH OF MRS. STOVALL. 

In the death of Mrs. Mary Stovall, 
which occurred June 13th at her home 
in Prospect Park, the community and 
church lost a valuable member. She 
leaves four sons and two daughters and 
a host of friends to mourn her loss. The 
funeral services were held at Wesley 
Chapel, Revs. G. R. Bryant and C. H. 
Anderson officiating. 


FIGHTING RACE ENTERPRISES. 

Afro-American ministers should draw 
the line at preaching the funerals of 
members of the race who are too good 
to be buried by colored undertakers. 

We have two first-class Afro-Ameri¬ 
can undertaking establishments in this 
city and colored people who want to give 
their money to white undertakers should 
be sent to white churches to have their 
funerals preached. If white undertakers 
are to have the money for burying them 
they ought to furnish white preachers, 
white cjioirs and white congregations. 
We trust that our ministers will take this 
matter up and put an end to dead ne¬ 
groes fighting race enterprises.

BRINGING FORTH A GHASTLY 
HARVEST. 

We have contended all along that the 
encouragement given mobs by the white 
press of this country, when their victims 
were black, would cheapen white men’s 
lives. The present epidemic of husband 
killing by white women is mob law’s 
ghastly harvest. Human life is sacred 
regardless of color or nationality. To 
cheapen the life of one class, no matter 
what the pretext, is to ultimately cheap¬ 
en all lives. That’s what you are do¬ 
ing in the United States/ High money, 
cheap life, low morality, is the estimate 
of this country abroad. The white news¬ 
papers are almost wholly responsible for 
the low value placed on human life and 
the low state of public morality. If the 
white papers of this country had put 
a higher value upon law and order than 
they did upon the few doLlars of blood 
money they received for endorsing mobs, 
mob law would long ago have been sup¬ 
pressed and human life, which is now the 
cheapest thing on the market, would be 


regarded as too sacred to be taken as a 
pastime. 

Condemning the burning of Rochelle, 
a negro, at Barto, Fla., May 28, 1901, 
we said of the women who witnessed the 
deed, that they were doomed to be the 
mothers of prenatal murderers who 
would strike down without mercy the 
members of their own household. 

Mrs. Scheck of this city, Mrs. 
Le Doux of Stockton, and Mrs. 
Myers, of St. Joseph, Mo., have fulfilled 
the prediction. The white men mur¬ 
derers named may not be daughters of 
the women mentioned, but they are the 
products of the sentiments of the mob’s 
fiendish atrocities. Mr. Storrs of Mon¬ 
rovia committed suicide. Mrs. Schenck’s 
husband was murdered by burglars, 
while Mrs. Myers’ husband was mur¬ 
dered by negroes. These are the stories 
first told by the dead men’s wives. But 
read the blood-curdling facts. Look at 
Buck, the cold-blooded' murderer of Mrs. 
Canfield, the millionaire’s wife. He ad¬ 
mitted he placed a low value on her life. 
It was as low as that placed on the Afro- 
American in Mississippi or Georgia. No, 
gentlemen, you have overdone the thing. 
You have made your own lives cheaper 
than hog meat. You have reduced pub¬ 
lic morality to such a low state that hu¬ 
man bodies are cooked up and sold for 
lard, ground into sausage, and the arm 
of a living human being sold for lamb 
pot pie. The stench from the charnal 
house you have made of your country is 
disgusting Christendom. The end is not 
yet. 

“Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall 
he also reap/’ 


THE STRICKLIN OLD FOLKS' 
HOME GONE DEMOCRATIC. 

One of the freaks of the present age 
is the gullibility of the average man. 
And one proof of the oneness of the hu¬ 
man family is the universal willingness 
of men to be gulled, whether savage or 
civilized. It is also proof that all men 
are children in various stages of devel¬ 
opment. With this information and the 
farther knowledge that the silliest and 
most gullible of mortals are white men 
and women who believe that they are 
afflicted with a taint of color prejudice, 
Mr. H. Stricklin, our colored butcher, 
bought out an outlawed “blind pig” es¬ 
tablishment on Pico Heights, and pro¬ 
posed to add insult to injury by build¬ 
ing an old folks’ home for superan¬ 
nuated Afro-Americans. Now Mr. 
Stricklin does not boast of anything ex¬ 
tra in book learning, but as a ‘reader of 
human nature lie is a past master. So, 


after sizing up the shape of the heads of 
the white people near the place, he de¬ 
cided to buy the property and levy a 
tribute of $15,000 for the relinquishment 
of his presence in that locality. The 
whole fake old folks’ home scheme was 
learned and published in one of the daily 
papers as a rare bit of news, giving 
Stricklin the advertising he wanted free. 

This was followed by frequent visits 
to the intended home by ragged, hob¬ 
bling, old colored people leaning on dis¬ 
carded broom handles used for canes. 
These visitors, who were perhaps in the 
pay of some one, would loiter about the 
place sunning themselves, giving the 
neighbors a foretaste of the future old 
folks’ home. Things took on a serious 
look, and those opposed to the home 
began to devise ways and means of rais¬ 
ing the tribute money. The Liberator's 
expose of the scheme was published, and 
the hustle for tribute was abandoned. 
We had no sympathy whatever for the 
silly negro haters, but we opposed 
Stricklin’s methods—exploiting the in¬ 
firmities of our old people to make mon¬ 
ey to be used for his private ends. This 
fnrced him to make a show of sincerity. 
He had his old folks' home association 
duly incorporated, with a full set of offi¬ 
cers. and emploved enough clerical abil¬ 
ity to run a railroad. Visiting a num¬ 
ber of Afro-American physicians, he 
proposed building a hospital in connec¬ 
tion with his old folks’ home, to be used 
by them free. They immediately ac¬ 
cepted his generous offer and gave the 
project their unqualified endorsement. 
The ministers were visited and their 
endorsement secured. Publishing a cut 
of the future home and some of its oc¬ 
cupants, Stricklin hod some building ma¬ 
terial put on the ground, and awaited 
developments. But the tribute money 
never came. Seeing that he had caiHit 
nothing but moneyless suckers,, he dis¬ 
charged his board of directors, left the 
salary of the secretary unpaid, gave the 
gullible doctors that oid horse-laugh, and 
built an up-to-date lodging house, which 
bears on the front that ever-present 
sign, “For Rent.” 


CARL SCHURZ JOINS THE MA¬

Carl Sclrurz, the soldier, statesman

may differ as to the wisdom of his po¬

sincerity and honesty of purpose. The 
object of his life was to make men bet¬

and equal opportunity for all mankind 
was his creed. Afro-Americans have 
lost a friend.

THE LIBERATOR. 


Afro-American Voters not 
PJeased with Coroner 
Trout. The Liberator 
Endorsed. 

Los Angeles, Cal., June 14, 1906. 
Mr. Edmonds, 

Ed. Liberator. 

I have read your paper for more than 
five years now, and take this opportunity 
to congratulate you upon making such 
a splendid fight against the mob; also 
for fighting for those things which tend 
to elevate the race. 

In a recent issue you advise us to re¬ 
member that the coroner’s actions are 
far from being impartial when the ne¬ 
gro’s interests are at stake. I am with 
you there, and believe in fighting to a 
finish every man who puts himself on 
record as being an enemy to the negro. 
I deem it good advice also to have and 
be able to shoot a good rifle. Every 
negro should be prepared to protect his 
home. 

If you do nothing more in this life 
than fight against mob law with a ven¬ 
geance, you will have filled your mis¬ 
sion. 

Wishing you much success in your 
undertaking, I beg to remain, 

Yours sincerely, 

A. C. GARROTT. ‘ 


A PARTING. 


(Written for The Liberator.) 


THE LIBERATOR ENDORSED. 

Elsewhere in these columns we publish 
a letter from Dr. A. C. Garrott, endors¬ 
ing the Liberator’s fight for even-handed 
justice for all. When one is struggling 
against oppression and wrong, battling 
for equal opportunities for all, it is no 
small reward to. know that he has the 
approval of the intelligent thinking peo¬ 
ple around him. 

While the doctor’s kind words of ap¬ 
proval are very helpful to us, they are 
worth vastly more to the cause we rep¬ 
resent by showing that we are reflect¬ 
ing the sentiment of our best people. 
The Afro-American needs no special 
legislation to help him in the race. All 
he asks is the impartial enforcement of 
the constitution and laws. He asks for 
nothing more, and it would be unmanly 
for him to be satisfied with anything 
less. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

Miss Mildred A. Howard has gone on 
an extended tour of the East. Canada 
will be visited. She is an intelligent and 
industrious young lady, a friend and sup¬ 
porter of race papers and other race en¬ 
terprises. Best wishes. 

* * * 

Mrs. Allen Watson and babe are tour¬ 
ing points of interest in Southern Cali¬ 
fornia. She reports a nice time, hav¬ 
ing many drives among splendid coun¬ 
try seats and fine ranches.

Elder T. Brown of San Francisco was 
a guest at the Edmonds villa, Sawteile. 
where he enjoyed an outing “long to be 
remembered,” he says. After luncheon 
the editor took him for a drive, which 


included Santa Monica, the Soldiers’ 
Home and Westgate. Elder Brown lost 
eevrything in the San Francisco earth¬ 
quake. His greatest loss was his li¬ 
brary, which was the largest and finest 
collection of rare books owned by an 
Afro-American west of the Rockies. He 
is an entertaining lecturer and race man 
with few equals. 

* * * 

Mr. Leonard Stovall graduated from 
the Hollywood high school on the 22d. 
His oration, “The Negro Educators,” 
was well received. The ovation ten¬ 
dered him was very flattering. Mr. Sto¬ 
vall was offered a free scholarship in 
Bidwell College, South Carolina, but he 
decided to enter the University of South¬ 
ern California and take the classical 
course preparatory to entering the med¬ 
ical department.

Miss Susie E. Edmonds graduated 
from the commercial department of the 
University of Southern California. She 
will enter the preparatory department 
next fall.

The following persons were elected as 
officers of the Epworth League: Mr. J.

Sweetheart, sweetheart, we’re parted 
now, 

My bosom throbs with pain ; 

A shadow lingers on my brow 
Until we meet again. 

Like song-bird thou didst wing thy 
flight 

To fairer realms than this; 

My sun hath faded from my sight 
And robbed my soul of bliss. 

I listen in the twilight glow 
To hear thy sweet refrain ; 

Thy matchless voice is silent now, 

And nought remains but pain. 

Farewell, but still I linger yet, 

I.n anguish moan and sigh; 

My cheeks with flowing tears are wet, 
Oh, must we say good-bye?

“Over There” by crystal streams 
Thy footsteps softly glide, 

In a mystic land of summer dreams 
Beyond the great divide.

GAS NEARLY KILLED TOURIST. 

W, H. Bomgardener, of Scranton, 
Iowa, was awakened at G o’clock 
Thursday morning in his room, 225 
North Olive street, almost overcome 
by escaping gas. With great difficulty 
he arose, and then fell on the floor, 
which immediately aroused the occu¬ 
pants, who came to his rescue by 
breaking down the door. His friend; 
W. L. Myers, of the Conservative 
Realty Company, was notified at once 
at the Severance building, as they dis¬ 
covered his card in the old gentleman’s 
pocket. Mr. Myers promptly attended 
to his wants, and the patient is re¬ 
ported doing nicely.
