JUDGE HUTTON A CANDIDATE 


When Judge Hutton announced 
his intentions to be a candidate 
for reelection as Superior Judge 
of Los Angeles County, his numer¬ 
ous friends got busy, circulated 
petitions and had his name placed 
on the primary ballot. This was 
done because the Judge was too 
busy performing his judicial duties 
to look after the matter. 

Judge Hutton is probably best 
known to the taxpayers of Los 
Angeles county by reason of the 
radical reforms he has inaugurated 
in his method of handling insanity 
cases. His success in this regard 
has been recognized by his fellow 
members of the Superior Court, 
who have assigned, permanently, 
to him the handling of this work, 
which he does in addition to pre¬ 
siding over Department Eleven 
of the Superior Court. 

When Judge Hutton became 
presiding judge of the Superior 
Court in May, 1911, the unfortu¬ 


nate people who were charged 
with being mentally incompetent 
were being carried through the 
streets of Los Angeles three or 
four times a day, before their 
cases were finally passed upon by 
court. Those who were slightly 
deranged, and raving maniacs, men 
and women, were huddled together 
in a common vehicle, and brought 
from the county hospital to the 
courthouse and then back to the hos¬ 
pital. This was merely for the pur¬ 
pose of arraignment. The day of their 
hearing, the trip was repeated. 
The duties of presiding judge in¬ 
cluded the handling of these in¬ 
sanity cases. It took but one 
day for Judge Hutton to decide 
that a radical change was needed. 
He immediately announced that 
he would hold a session of the 
court at the County hospital three 
times a week, Mondays, Wednes¬ 
days and Fridays. This instituted 
the first open Superior Court in 
the United States. The hospital 
authorities, at the suggestion of 
Judge Hutton, reserved the front 
porch of the building used for the 
insane patients for the use of the 
court. Here the cases are heard 
quietly, but with little formality. 
The physicians and members of 
lunacy commission have materially 
aided Judge Hutton in this work, 
before the hearings, talking to the 
patients, not simply confining 
themselves to the formal examina¬ 
tion in the court rooms. 


JUDGE McCORMICK 


Judge McCormick who is a 
candidate to succeed himself as 
Judge of the Superior Court, has 
made an excellent record. For 
the past two years he has served 
the people on the bench and has 
always been kind and courteous, 



JUDGE McCORMICK 


but fearless. His object has not 
been altogether to punish criminals, 
but he has made a close study 
of individual cases, especially of 
first offenders, with the object in 
view of reforming offenders when¬ 
ever there was an opportunity. 
He is a firm believer in the pro¬ 
bation system in most cases, but 
night-time burglars or armed hold¬ 
up men, he does not believe, as 
a general rule are objects for the 
law’s leniency, only in extreme 
cases. 

The probation system has been 
given a thorough test by Judge 
McCormick with the result that 
over 95% of those to whom he 
has granted probation have made 
good and not violated their prom¬ 
ises. The Judge has always been 
ready to lend a helping hand to 
offenders, but at the same time 
he is as quick to administer severe 
punishment when lie deems it 
necessary.

THE LIBERATOR 


Since the inception of the Dar- 
row trial, Judge McCormick has 
handled the entire criminal busi¬ 
ness of the county in his court, 
and yet, with the additional burd¬ 
en of an extra court, his calendar 
is kept clean down to the minute. 

MR. JOHN M. YORK FOR 
SUPERIOR JUDGE 


Mr. John M. York, an eminent 
young lawyer and son of Judge 
York, is candidate for Superior 
Judge. From his knowledge of 
law and experience gained by the 
practice of his profession in his 
father’s office, he is well fitted for 
the position of Superior Judge. 
From our long personal acquaint¬ 
ance with Mr. York, we heaitily 
recommend him to the colored 
voters. As judge, he will dispense 
equal justice. A local East Side 
paper has the following to say: 

“John M. York takes pleasure 
and pride in the fact that he is 
a native son of California and that 
some 25 years ago he went to 
school in a” little chapel on Daly 
street back of the 2nd Pres. Church, 
and his memories of East Los 
Angeles school days are enjoyable. 
Later he was a student in the 
Polytechnic and the University 
of Virginia, but he was destined 
for the law, and from his earliest 
days was fed doses of Blackstone 
and Kent. 

He is the son of Judge Waldo 
M. York with whom he studied 
and has ever since been connected 
in practice with a large suite of 
offices in the Mason block and a 
leading business at the bar. He 
now aspires to the office of judge 
of the Superior Court and, if nom¬ 
inated and elected, he will do 
honor to the position and mete 
out prompt even-handed justice 
to all. 

The writer has taken special 
pains to inquire into his qualifica¬ 
tions. One attorney said: “Waldo 
York is a good lawyer, but John M. 
is even better than the Judge, 
which is going some.” He is 
bright, genial, public spirited and 
progressive. We have been dis¬ 
pleased with some of our judges. 


If this young man goes on the bench 
he will give entire satisfaction and 
we may quote Shakespeare thus: 
“Now is the winter of our discon¬ 
tent; 

Made glorious summer by this 
son of York.” 



COL. W. H. HOLABIRD 


Col. W. H. Holabird, candidate 
for nomination to Congress in 
the 10th District on the Republi¬ 
can ticket, submits his attitude 
on the tariff question, which he 
regards as of paramount interest 
to the nation, as follows: 

“The great and continued pros¬ 
perity of the United States, which 
exceeds that of any other country 
in the world by far, is, in a large 
measure, due to our wise policy 
of a protective tariff. 

No thinking person would argue 
that this tariff should not be 
changed with changing conditions 
and the attendant necessities, for, 
from the very nature of things, 
progress in our national life brings 
about constant changes. How¬ 
ever, so important a factor in our 
national well-being should not be 
altered without such expert and 
scientific advice as a Tariff Com¬ 


mission could give, and I, there¬ 
fore, believe in the maintenance 
of a Tariff Commission composed 
of experts in this branch of polit¬ 
ical economy. 

With such information before 
Congress, the necessary revisions 
and changes could be safely and 
expeditiously made and due regard 
be given to these industries which 
are entitled to protection; also 
protecting labor, which is, by far, 
the most impotrant factor in this 
whole tariff question. We should 
deal equitably with the subject, as 
it relates to the people and in¬ 
dustries of the whole nation. 

California is enjoying very great 
benefits from a protective tariff 
on citrus fruits, olives and other 
products. These products cannot 
be grown elesewhere in the United 
States except in a very limited 
area on the Gulf of Mexico. We 
cannot reasonably ask the repre¬ 
sentatives in Congress, from other 
states, in the majority of which 
citrus fruits cannot be grown, to 
give us the benefit of a high tariff 
on these products, if we show a 
desire and willingness to remove 
the tariff from the products and 
commodities in which they are 
interested. 

I stand firmly and steadfastly, 
and I sincerely believe, with a 
great majority of the people of 
this great nation, upon the propo¬ 
sition to better tariff conditions 
in this country.” 


JUDICIAL CANDIDATES. 


We present to our readers in 
this edition of The Liberator a 
number of well known judges who 
are candidates for re-election. In 
recommending these judges to the 
suffrage of the colored voters, we 
are pleased to say that they are 
spoken of in the highest terms 
by the colored attorneys. In so¬ 
liciting the support of the colored 
voters for these judges, the recom¬ 
mendation of the colored attorn¬ 
eys who practice before them is 
the best evidence we have of their 
judicial fairness. We, therefore, 
trust that they will receive the 

































THE LIBERATOR 


THRE 


votes of every Negro voter in the 
County. 

In this connection, it is not 
out of place for us to say that 
we have often said’, that the 
judiciary of this County, on the 
whole, in matters respecting the 
rights of all the people, is second 
to none in the country. 



JUDGE FREDERICK HOUSER 


Among the judges who are candi¬ 
dates to succeed themselves, none 
are more worthy of the suffrage 
of the people than is Judge Fred¬ 
erick Houser. His record on the 
bench has been such as to make 
him popular with all persons having 
business in the court. Regardless 
of the result of litigation, all 
parties have usually felt that his 
decisions were just. 

His decision in the damage suit 
brought against the Pantages 
Theater by Mr. Geo. 0. Cochran, 
for discriminating against him on 
account of color, was the first 
time damages were awarded to 
a Negro in such a case. There 
have been many cases of this 
kind tried in some of our local 
courts, but they were usually side¬ 
stepped or thrown out on a tech¬ 
nicality. But parties who delib¬ 
erately violate the law with the 
hope of escaping punishment for 


their crimes through technicality, 
meet with little encouragement in 
Judge Houser’s court. Every per¬ 
son, white or black, who believe 
in the enforcement of all the laws, 
will vote for Judge Frederick 
Houser. 


JUDGE JAMES C. RIVES 


Whenever the probate court is 
mentioned, the hearer, whether 
a member of the bar or an or¬ 
dinary citizen, the name of Judge 
Rives instantly suggests itself. This 
is due to the able and satisfactory 
manner with which Judge Rives 
has handled all matters coming 
before that court; and when the 
time for election of Judges comes 
around, no well informed voter 
entertains the thought of making 
a change in department Two, over 
which Judge Rives presides. Im¬ 
mediately the demand for his re¬ 
tention becomes universal. From 
one of the numerous country papers 
every one of which is loyally sup¬ 
porting Judge Rives, we quote 
the following excerpt: 

“One of the candidates for su¬ 
perior judge of Los Angeles county 
who will doubtless receive a heavy 
vote is Judge James C. Rives, 
of Department 2, who is a candi¬ 
date to succeed himself. He has 
the strong support not only of 
the attorneys but of those people 
who have had cases in his de¬ 
partment, which handles the pro¬ 
bate business of the county. The 
importance of this office and the 
necessity for electing a man of 
experience and ability is shown 
by the statement that the pro¬ 
bate department of the Superior 
Court of Los Angeles county 
handles business to the extent 
of $50,000,000 annually. The a- 
mount represented in cases now 
in process of probate will exceed 
$300,000,000. 

Millions upon millions of dollars’ 
worth of trust money is under the 
direct control of the probate judge. 
He has handled many of the great¬ 
est estates in the country, some 
of which are still passing through 
the court. As many special pro¬ 
ceedings are necessary, an immense 



Judge James C. Rives 

amount of work is involved, the 
volume of which grows larger each 
year. For its population, Los An¬ 
geles has the largest amount of 
probate business of any county 
in the United States. 

Among the large estates handled 
in this court are the Baldwin, 
Mullen, de Geyser, Little, Jones', 
Heilman, Bicknell, Toberman, Van 
Nuys, Ballerino, Porter, McNally, 
Whiting, de Groot, Bergin, Bryson^ 
Keating, Eyraud, Meier, and Gil¬ 
more. These estates will average 
over $1,000,000.

event of his election, will give the 
colored people a square deal at 
the County Hospital Nurse train¬ 
ing school. In due time Mr. Prid- 
ham will discover his error in this 
course. And if the belief that Mr. 
Patterson will give all the people 
of the county a square deal at 
the County Hospital, will defeat 
him, he will welcome defeat. The 
feeling of the working white peo¬ 
ple of the 5th Supervisorial Dis¬ 
trict is strongly against Mr. Prid¬ 
ham. This is undoubtedly due 
to the same reason that will cost 
him the Negro vote. The office¬ 
holder who will discriminate a- 
gainst the Negro because he is 
a Negro, will discriminate against 
the white man because he is poor. 
Mr. Pridham has forfeited the 
Negro vote and it will be cast 
solidly against him. The fact is, 
Mr. Pridham’s defeat is a fore¬ 
gone conclusion.

1360 E. 33rd St, Los Angeles. 

Aug. 19, 1912. 
Editor The Liberator :— 

Dear Sir, 

I see by the Times last Saturday 
that my name was mentioned as 
one of the organizers and officers 
of a political club known as The 
Independent Political League. 
Permit me to say just here that I 
know nothing of such a club and 
that my name was used absolutely 
without my knowledge or consent. 
I am taking no stock whatever 
in politics, I am, 

Yours very truly, 
Jas. G. Edmonds. 


MR. CHAS. E. PATTERSON THE 
MAN 


The strength Mr. Chas. E. Pat¬ 
terson's candidacy has developed 
throughout the 5th Supervisorial 
District is such that his election 
is generally conceded by persons 
who understand the situation. 
Having faithfully served the peo¬ 
ple of that district as Supervisor 
.prior to the election of Mr. Prid¬ 
ham, Mr. Patterson is no stranger 
to the taxpayres. In order to 
prejudice certain white people of 
the district against Mr. Patterson, 
Mr. Pridham is charged with 
stating that Mr. Patterson, in the 


The rapid movement of the 
colored voters toward Mr. McCabe 
is indeed gratifying. This change 
of sentiment in favor of Mr. 
McCabe is due to the fact that 
the colored voters are beginning 
to realize the possibility of de¬ 
feating their object by dividing 
their strength. Mr. McCabe, like 
Mr. C. J. Nellis, has done what 
he could to secure a square deal 
for all citizens, regardless of race 
or color. If Mr. McCabe receives 
the colored vote as he should, he 
will be nominated at the primar¬ 
ies and elected at the polls. 

Should he, by a division of our 
strength, be defeated at the pri¬ 
maries, it would mean the election 
of a Lissner candidate at the polls 
—a calamity that would strike 
every business interest of the 
County. If the rights of all the 
people are to be respected without 
regard to race, color or condition, 
the Negro will have to turn out 
and assist the fair-minded white 
people in electing H. D. McCabe 
in the second district, C. J. Nellis 
in the fourth district and C. E. 
Patterson in the fifth district. 
This they will do. 


Editor of The Liberator, 

Dear Sir:— 

Will you kindly announce the 
fact that the political club organ¬ 
ized Friday night last, in my 
absence and without my knowl¬ 
edge or consent used my name 
as one of their executive officers. 
While constantly urging honest 
and intelligent political organiza¬ 
tion among our people, I have no 
sympathy, patience or respect for 
the Negro resident or adventurer 
who does politics for cash in hand. 
Let them work for a living the 
same as you and I and all other 
honest Negroes do. What we need 
and must have here in our city 
is a political organization of our 
people which will work for the 
general good of our race and do 
their work thoroughly and well 
without any expense to the white 
man whatsoever. When this is 
done we will not only be entitled 
to, but will receive the representa¬ 
tion we deserve the same as all 
other Americans. Yours for 
honest politics and racial success, 
Chas. C. Flint.

OUR SALLY IS GONE ! 


Miss Sally L. Edmonds, beloved 
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. L. 
Edmonds who died on Sunday, 
Aug. 11, after a long illness, was 
a beautiful character. On account 
of her sweet cheerful disposition,, 
she was the favorite of each in¬ 
dividual member of the fxmily. 
Mentally, she was exceptionally 
bright, standing well in her classes 
at school where she was a general 
favorite.* 

She was born near Hollywood, 
Tunica County, Miss., Aug. 18, 
1890, and died at her home in 
Sawtelle, Aug. 11, 1912. The 
funeral services which were simple 
and impressive, were held at the 
family residence and were con¬ 
ducted by Rev. A. H. Cheshire, 
assisted by Rev. E. W. Kenchen. 
Mr. John Hall, leader of the Hall 
Jubilee Singers, sang: “Death Is 
Only A Dream.” Sally requested 
that Mr. Hall come and sing this 
song to her before her death, but 
unfortunately, Mr. Hall came too 
late so he sang it at her funeral. 
She was a devoted Christian and 
died a Christian’s death. At 
W oodlawn Cemetary: 


u ln the cold moist earth we laid her , 
When the forest cast the leaf , 

And wept that one so lovely 
Should have a life so brief. 

Sally thou was’t mild and lovely , 
Gentle as a little child , 

Pleasant as the air of evening 
As it floats among the trees. 

Peaceful be thy silent slumbers, 
Peaceful in the grave so low, 

Thou no more wilt join our number , 
Thou no more our songs will know. 

Yet again we hope to meet you 
When this day of life is o'er, 

And in Heaven with joy to greet you. 
Where no farewell tear is shed.” 

VOTERS HOLD BIG RALLY 


The meeting of the voters of 
precincts 180 and 183 held a big 
mass meeting at West 35th and 
Denker Ave., on the 20th. It was 
the largest and most enthusiastic 
meeting of colored voters during 
this campaign. The Hall was 
packed to the doors with colored 
men and women voters. Mr. F. B. 
Alexander, who deserves much 
credit for getting up the meeting, 
presided.
