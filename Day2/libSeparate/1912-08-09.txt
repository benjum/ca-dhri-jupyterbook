WILL THE NEGROES ELECT TAFT OR WILSON 

FOR PRESIDENT? 


The colored voter now stands 
face to face with the great question 
of the proper use of his electoral 
franchise. Under the normal con¬ 
ditions 2,000,000 of the 20,000,000 
votes which might be cast at a 
presidential election would belong 
to the race, and some day, despite 
every effort of fraud and race 
prejudice, those votes are going 
to be cast. 

Today, however, of the 15,000,- 
000 or more votes which will ac¬ 
tually be cast for President, some 
500,000 will be black men's votes. 

What shall we do with these 
500,000 ballots? 

First of all we must teach our¬ 
selves to regard them seriously. 
The Negro-American is not dis¬ 
franchised; on the contrary, he 
is a half a million votes this side 
of disfranchisement and that is a 
long, long way. There have been 
but two or three presidential elec¬ 
tions since the war which have not 
been settled by a margin of less 
than a half million votes, and in 
every single election since the 
proslavery compromise of 1850 such 
a number of votes distributed at 
strategic points would easily have 
decided the presidency. 

The votes of the black Ameri¬ 
cans are today at strategic points. 
We may, of course, leave the South 
out of account: on account of 
illegal enactments and brazen fraud, 
democratic government exists in 
the South only in inchoate and 
incomplete form. The presidential 
election is probably going to be 
decided by the Middle West and 
the States of New York and New 
Jersey. New York and Ohio have 
each between 40,000 and 50,000 


colored votes; New Jersey, Illinois 
and Indiana have each 30,000 or 
more. Is there any political proph¬ 
et who would risk his reputation 
on the possibility of any one of 
these States being carried by more 
than 20,000 majority? There may 
be majorities of 50,000 or 100,000 
in one or two of the States, but 
the chances are that the colored 
voters hold the balance of power 
in every one of their States and 
thus have the power to say whether 
William Howard Taft or Woodrow 
Wilson shall be the next President. 

If colored America had long po¬ 
litical experience and wide know¬ 
ledge of men and measures, it 
would organize the black voters 
of each State into a solid phalanx. 
It would say to this phalanx: 
white and colored voters in this 
land are selling their votes too 
cheaply. By the use of a “slush 
fund” of $3,000,000 Theodore 
Roosevelt was able almost to split 
the Republican party. You could 
easily sell your votes next Novem¬ 
ber for one or two millions of 
dollars, but that is too cheap. 
You could easily sell your votes for 
an Assistant Attorney-General, a 
Register of the Treasury, a Re¬ 
corder of Deeds and a few other 
black wooden men whose duty 
it is to look pleasant, say nothing 
and have no opinions that a white 
man is bound to respect. This 
also is too cheap—it is dirt cheap. 

What price would you ask for 
500,000 votes, black America? You 
should ask this: 

1. The abolition of the inter¬ 
state “Jim Crow” car. 

2. The enforcement of the Thir¬ 
teenth Amendment by the sup¬ 


pression of peonage. 

3. The enforcement of the Four¬ 
teenth Amendment by cutting down 
the representation in Congress of 
the rotten boroughs of the South. 

4. National aid to elementary 
piblic schools without class or 
racial discrimination. 

Is this price too mush to pay for 
a presidency? It is not if you dare 
ask it. 

Who then would pay it? Would 
William Howard Taft pay it? There 
has not been in the presidential 
chair for fifty years a man so 
utterly lacking in initiative and 
ideal as Mr. Taft. His abject 
surrender to Southern prejudice 
and reaction has been simply pitia¬ 
ble; He began his career by de¬ 
fending disfranchisement; he fol¬ 
lowed this by promising to appoint 
no black man to office if any white 
man protested; and in spite of the 
fact that over 200 Negroes have 
been publicly murdered without 
trial during his administration, the 
utmost that 10,000,000 black men 
have elicited from his lips is a 
hesitating statement that he is 
sorry—and helpless. Any colored 
man who votes for Mr. Taft will 
do so on the assumption that zero 
is better than minus one. 

As to Mr. Wilson, there are, one 
must confess, disquieting facts: 
he was born in Virginia and he was 
long president of a college which 
did not admit Negro students 
and yet was not honest enough 
to say so, resorting rather to sub¬ 
terfuge and evasion. A man, how¬ 
ever, is not wholly responsible for 
his birthplace or his college. On 
the whole, we do not believe that 
Woodrow Wilson admires Negroes.

THE LIBERATOR 


Left to himself, we suspect he 
would be like Mr. Johnson, the 
new dean of Yale. Mr. Johnson is 
a Southerner, and recently told 
a colored applicant that Yale did 
not want “Chinese, Jews or Ne¬ 
groes/’ The ideal of such folk 
would be a world inhabited by 
flaxen-haired wax dolls with or 
without brains. 

Notwithstanding such possible 
preferences, Woodrow Wilson is a 
cultivated scholar and he has 
brains. We know that there are 
several hundred millions of “Chin¬ 
ese, Jews and Negroes” who have 
to be reckoned with, and that the 
date at which the “blond beast” 
will inherit the earth has been, to 
put it mildly, indefinitely post¬ 
poned. We have therefore, a con¬ 
viction that Mr. Wilson will treat 
black men and their interests with 
farsighted fairness. He will not be 
our friend, but he will not belong 
to the gang of which Tillman, 
Vardaman, Hoke Smith and Blease 
are the brilliant expositors. He 
will not advance the cause of oli¬ 
garchy in the South, he will not 
seek further means of “Jim Crow” 
insult, he will not dismiss black 
men wholesale from office, and he 
will remember that the Negro 
in the United States has a right 
to be heard and considered; and 
if he becomes President by the 
grace of the black man’s votes, his 
Democrats successors may be wil¬ 
ling to pay the black man’s price 
of decent travel, free labor, votes 
and education. 

Outside of these two men, what 
else? We thank God that Theo¬ 
dore Roosevelt has been eliminated. 
How many black men, with the 
memory of Brownsville, could sup¬ 
port such a man passes our com¬ 
prehension.

THE SEASIDE CAFETERIA 
CHANGES HANDS 

Mrs. S. L. Nichols and Miss S. 
Alston have purchased the Seaside 
Cafeteria and Ice Cream Parlor at 
1511 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica. 
They entertained the Federation 
of Women’s Clubs last Saturday on 
their trolley trip to Santa Monica. 


THE LYCEUM’S BANQUET A 
RECORD BREAKER 


Patronized by the Best People of 
the City 


The Lyceum’s Banquet at Wes¬ 
ley M. E. Church was attended 
by one of the most brilliant as 
well as the most interesting as¬ 
semblages that ever gathered in 
the splendid dining hall of Wesley 
M. E. Church. Wesley has been 
the scene of many brilliant assem¬ 
blages, but the assemblage that 
gathered there on the 30th marks 
a new departure in the history of 
the race in this city. It was the 
first time that the business, pro¬ 
fessional and lay members of the 
race sat down together around a 
banquet table to devise ways and 
means of bringing about closer 
business and social relations—to 
the end that race enterprises be 
fostered and encouraged and the 
race be brought in unison in all 
matters looking to its advance¬ 
ment. Such a meeting had been 
suggested time and again by many 
of the leading men and women 
of the city, but how to make such 
a meeting a success was the ques¬ 
tion. Acting upon the suggestion 
Mr. G. Walter Snell, chairman of 
the Lyceum’s program committee, 
suggested to the Lyceum that it 
take the matter of the banquet up. 
As Mr. Snell is preparing to leave 
the State, as representative of the 
Harding Land Company, of Rose- 
burg, Oregon, he was anxious to 
take part in such a meeting before 
leaving. As a result, the people 
of every class generously responded 
and the sixty ladies and gentle¬ 
men who honored the occasion 
with their presence, were the big 
colored men and women of the 
city,—big in love of race, big in 
aspiration, big in ambition to do 
things and play honorable parts 
in the making of a race. Among 
those seated around the banquet 
table were ministers of the gospel, 
lawyers, physicians, merchants, 
newspaper men, contractors and 
day laborers—sinews without 
which no race can succeed. 

Seated around the table were 


Secy, and Mrs. T. A. Greene of 
the Y. M. C. A., Rev. W. J. J. 
Byers, Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Daugh¬ 
erty, Rev. E. T. Hubbard, Mr. and 
Mrs. Prentice, Mrs. Thomas, Mr. 
and Mrs. Lott, Atty. and Mrs. 
Ceruti, Rev. E. F. Henderson, 
Mr. J. Thos. Norris, Mr. G. Walter 
Snell, Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Spigner, 
Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Hill, Mr. and 
Mrs. L. P. Ashford, Mr. Eugene 
Walker, Dr. Leggett, Dr. Somer¬ 
ville, Atty. A. McDowell, J. L. 
Edmonds, Jr., B. K. Edmonds, 
Mr. R. A. Davis, Mr. Herbert 
Flint, Mr. Thompson, Mr. V. W. 
Morris, Mr. W. H. Joyce, Prof. 
W. E. Easton, Mrs. E. Pryor, Mr. 
S. S. Irving, Mr. Frank Mouser, 
Mr. Wm. Telle, Mr. W. C. Harding, 
Mr. Foster, Mr. Govan Dowdy, 
Mr. J. W. Coleman, W. T. 
Henderson and Mr. H. A. Reeves. 

We regret that there were many 
present whose names our repre¬ 
sentative failed to secure, among 
whom there were many young 
men accompanied by their best 
girls. Many business men and 
women who could not be present 
sent hearty greetings, promising 
their hearty cooperation in what¬ 
ever was done. 

Among the business men and 
women who were present 
were Mr. Eugene Walker, mer¬ 
chant tailor, Mr. Herbert Flint, 
who represented his father, Mr. 
C. C. Flint, the grocer and who 
could not be present, Mr. C. H. 
Daugherty, grocer of Washington 
and Santa Fe Ave., Mr. W. H. 
Joyce, the grocer of 1522 W. 35th 
Place, Mr. R. A. Davis, the cement 
contractor, Mr. B. K. Edmonds of 
the Edmonds-Kajuira Produce Co., 
of Sawtelle, Mr. and Mrs. Prentice, 
dry goods and notions, East 9th St., 
Mrs. Thomas, 411 E. 7th St., 
ladies’ tailor, Mr. W. C. Harding, 
president of the Harding Land Co., 
Roseburg, Oregon, Rev. E. F. 
Henderson and Mr. T. Alexander, 
real estate. Mr. H. A. Reeves rep¬ 
resented the juuk dealers. 

Toasts. 

Mr. J. Thomas Norris, presi¬ 
dent of the Lyceum, introduced 
the Editor of this journal as toast- 











THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


master, who, after expressing his 
appreciation of the honor, intro¬ 
duced Secy T. A. Greene, who 
responded to the toast—the Y. M. 
C. A. In a few brief sentences, 
he told of the needs and object of the 
Y.M.C.A. He stated that the busi¬ 
ness of making men was the first 
and most impotrant business of 
a community, therefore the Y. M. 
C. A. is performing a task second 
in importance to none. “The 
Child” was responded to by Rev. 
W. J. J. Byers, who stated that 
the child is the forerunner of the 
man and therefore it is the duty 
of both the Church and state to 
throw around the child every pos¬ 
sible protection, securing to it 
every means of development to 
the end that the child become a 
desirable man. He urged the im¬ 
portance of proper home training 
and proper environments for the 
youths of the land. Mrs. Prentiss 
who read an ecxellent paper on 
the business woman, captured the 
honors of the evening and placed 
the women in the front rank of 
our business people. Atty. E. 
Burton Ceruti, responding to the 
toast, “Secret Societies,” told of 
the important place the societies 
occupied in the development of 
the race and deprecated the ten¬ 
dency of the race to divide up 
into factions at a time when unity 
is so necessary. Responding to 
the toast “Negro Authors,” Prof. 
Easton, author of “Dessalanes,” 
and other valuable books, made 
one of the happiest speeches of 
the evening. Mr. J. W. Coleman, 
the well-known employment agent, 
delivered a speech that was both 
amusing and instructive. He 
stated that in the past six years 
he had secured employment 
for twelve thousand colored per¬ 
sons and stated that in his line 
he was succeeding nicely, delivering 
and receiving the goods in a way 
that defied competition. Mr. L. P. 
Ashford, the laundry man requested 
only a chance and he would keep 
everybody clean, Mr. S. S. Irving 
represented the tonsorial artists 
of the city. 

Many persons who could not 
be present bought tickets to assist 


in taking care of the financial end 
of the banquet, among whom were: 
Mr. Geo. S. Brown, proprietor 
of the Golden West Hotel, three 
tickets; Mr. J. L. Holt, caterer, 
two tickets; Rev. William Shipley, 
two tickets; Mr. L. A. Handley, 
City Clerk, one ticket; Dr. J. S. 
Outlaw, one ticket and there were 
others whose names we failed to 
secure. 

Among those who labored to 
make the banquet the success it 
was, none deserve more credit 
than do Mmes. S. H. Green, J. 
Thos. Norris, G. Walter Snell and 
Mrs. Dallas. Without the ser¬ 
vices of the ladies named, it would 
have been impossible, to have made 
the banquet the success it proved 
to be. 

Everything used at the banquet 
was supplied by the colored busi¬ 
ness men. The rolls which were 
so much enjoyed by tne banqueters 
were made by Mr. Kinard, the 
baker. 

Although the banquet was the 
first of the kind ever attempted 
in the city, it was an immense 
success from every point of view. 
In point of interest created among 
the people and of the character 
of those who attended, of the in¬ 
telligence displayed in response to 
the toasts, it was a success.

THE COLOR LINE IN THE 
PUBLIC SERVICE TO 
BE RIGIDLY ENFORCED 


The indorsement of Supervisor 
Pridham for reelection by the 
Lissner machine fully discloses the 
policy it intends to pursue with 
respect to the Negro. To Super¬ 
visor Pridham is due the refusal to 
admit colored girls to the nurse¬ 
training school of the County 
Hospital. That is undoubtedly the 
most outrageous piece of injustice 
ever perpetrated upon the Negroes 
of this state and if allowed to be 
permanently successful will lay the 
foundations for the denial to them 


of every manhood right. With the 
Lissner machine indorsement, shows 
that Mr.Pridhams position in closing 
the nurse training school to Negro 
girls on account of cloor was the 
result of a pre-arranged policy. 
A policy to force out and keep out 
of the public service all Negroes. 
The sneaking means adopted by 
which the Negroes were gotten out 
of the parks and their teams let 
out of the street department and 
the juggling of the civil service 
to keep any more of them from 
getting into the police and fire 
departments, is now made plain. 
And the duty of the Negro voters 
is made equally plain—and that 
is that every candidate for office 
that has the Lissner indorsement 
must be voted solidly against by 
the Negroes, for can any man get 
the Lissner indorsement without 
agreeing to be governed by his 
dictation? The Lissner indorse¬ 
ment of Supervisor Pridham un¬ 
covers the whole wretched plot 
and no Negro with a spark of man¬ 
hood in him can stand sponsor 
or support any candidate wearing 
the Lissner Yoke. 

In many of the districts the 
Negroes will have the balance of 
power at the September primar¬ 
ies. This is true in several dis¬ 
tricts represented by a progressive 
or Lissner cabdidates. In each 
such case, the solid Negro vote 
must be cast against him. If 
this is done, and it must be done, 
the men responsible for drawing 
the color line in the public service, 
will be defeated. 

The position taken by Mr. Liss¬ 
ner, the chief Roosevelt shouter 
in this State, and political boss, 
coupled wirh the attitude toward 
the Negroes, assumed by Mr. 
Roosevelt at Chicago, shows the 
Negroes what they may expect 
from a Roosevelt triumph, whether 
local or national. 

If the colored women voters 
in Mr. Pridham’s district do their 
duty, he hasn’t a ghost of a 
show. There is certainly not a 
Negro man in that district so low, 
unmanly, contemptible and base 
enough to support Mr. Pridham. 
Think of a Negro man voting for 


a white man who brazenly closes 
the door of hope to respectable 
Negro women because they are 
black. The hottest place in 
Hades would be too cool for such 
a Negro. 


A DISGRACEFUL AFFAIR 

If reports are true, and we have 
no reason to doubt them, the 
Baptist Union picnic at Playa del 
Rey July 26th was a disgrace to 
every person connected with it. 
The taking of several thousand 
Sunday School children to a no¬ 
torious whiskey joint for a picnic 
is absolutely without excuse, es¬ 
pecially when the whole town had 
been ransacked by advertising 
the affair in all the dives to secure 
a big crowd in order that the rev¬ 
enue of ten cents per head could 
be secured by congregating in 
one place the children of tender 
age with an indiscriminate rabble. 
The ministers of the gospel and 
promoters of an affair that was so 
disgraceful knew that whiskey was 
sold at Playa del Rey and their prev¬ 
ious experience at AlamitosBay leav¬ 
es them without any excuse for the 
drunkeness and disorder that the 
Sunday School children witnessed 
at Playa del Rey. There were not 
only drunken women, but girls of 
tender age too intoxicated to prop¬ 
erly care for themselves. And the 
fights that frequently took place 
between men and women would 
not be tolerated by the police, 
in a bawdy district. 

There has been many denials of 
those disgraceful scenes, but we 
have the sad facts here stated from 
reliable people, both white and 
black, who were at the picnic. 
The whiskey men boast that they 
sell more whiskey at these S.S. Union 
picnics than they do any other day 
in the year. It is estimated by 
persons in a position to know, that 
$1,500.00 was taken in from the 
sale of whiskey and beer. 

Discussing that disgraceful af¬ 
fair, a Baptist minister said that 
he did not allow his children to 
attend, knowing that it would be 
no fit place for them. That being 
true, it was certainly a poor place 
for any one else’s child. If where 







































THE LIBERATOR 


FIT* 


whiskey is sold is the only place 
colored ministers can secure for 
Sunday School picnics, they should 
be abandoned for all time to come, 
leaving each individual family 
free to take their children to the 
beach for a day’s outing. What is 
said in this connection, is said 
with sincere regret, but we know of 
no other way to prevent our inno¬ 
cent boys and girls from witnessing 
such disgraceful scenes but the 
publication of them that they may 
be seen in all their hideousness. 
It has also been stated that some of 
the colored professional men were 
seen brazenly drinking beer in the 
pavilion in the presence of women 
and children. No man or set of 
men with religious pretensions 
should take their Sunday Schools to 
a place where intoxicating liquors 
are sold. 

We hope that the above charge 
is not true. “It is well, however 
to avoid even the appearance of 
evil.”
