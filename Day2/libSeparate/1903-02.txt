THE LIBERATOR. 


Secretary Root on The Race 
Problem. 

In his address to the Union League 
club of New York, February 7, Secre¬ 
tary Root, after referring briefly to the 
labor problem, touched upon the race 
problem thus: 

‘'After the Civil war the great ques¬ 
tion was ‘what shall we do with the 
black man?’ and the answer was ‘give 
him citizenship, equal rights and he 
will rise.’ Three amendments were 
added to the constitution, and I fear we 
will have to face the conclusion that 
the experiment has failed.” 

The failure, if there has been any, is 
due to the failure of the country to en¬ 
force its laws. Any law that is not en¬ 
forced is a failure. The officers of the 
law who allows an armed highwayman 
to relieve a citizen of his valuables be¬ 
cause the citizen is an ex-slave or a 
Jew, can make the same plea, and it 
would be just as logical as Mr. Root’s 
plea. You can’t fool the people, Mr. 
Root, by dodging the issue. The ques¬ 
tion to be settled is: Shall all of the 
citizens exercise their constitutional 
rights? Dodge it as you may, it will 
have to be settled. He concludes as 
follows: 

“A curious development has been 
seen within the gast year. President 
Roosevelt has appointed fewer blac^ 
men than President McKinley and there 
are fewer black men holding office than 
when McKinley died. Loud outcries are 
to be heard in the south about Presi¬ 
dent Roosevelt’s policy -of appointing 
black .men to office in the south. Under 
previous presidents, McKinley, Cleve¬ 
land, Harrison and hack to Hayes' 
time, more negroes were appointed to 
office and nothing was said. 

“A black man attended one of the 
receptions in Washington at the White 
House a short time ago. The black 
man, as an official of the government, 
had always attended the receptions. Yet 
the invitation of the president to this 
man was the signal for an outcry of a 
thousand papers in the South that the 
whites are being insulted. 

“I do not wish to argue this ques¬ 
tion. I am only showing that we have 
to face a change of feeling in the South, 
where the black man is denied the right 
to irpire to the highest there is in 
American citizenship. This right to 
aspire to the highest dignity, which 


was formerly unquestioned, is now 
questioned. In a short time the white 
man will succeed in excluding the black 
man from all the offices in the Southern 
states. We can never throw off the re¬ 
sponsibility that rests upon our people 
for the welfare of these black people 
that we held in slavery for so .many 
generations. Now that the first at¬ 
tempt has failed the question is what 
to do and it should take the greatest 
thought of the greatest minds of the 
country.” 

If the amendments had been enforced 
from the start there would, now be no 
race problem. It will have to come. 

-o- 

AFTER DR. PARKHURST’S SCALP. 

The Southern press is redhot with Dr. 
Parkhurst because he is credited with 
saying that: 

“Even at this day, so long after the 
proclamation of emancipation, there is 
in many parts of the South a condition 
of veritable slavery. Although we 
claim to be a civilized people, there is 
a degree of barbarism in our treatment 
of the black race that is not exceeded 
in any part of the world. And although 
we send out missionaries to Christian¬ 
ize other lands, there are communities 
in the South as un-Christian as any 
part of heathendom.” 

It is difficult to see how any person 
claiming to be honest can deny the 
aoove. Look at the everyday lynching 
of negroes in the South, the burnings 
at the stake with unspeakable barbar¬ 
ism. To give the women and children 
a chance to take part in these brutal¬ 
izing crimes, holidays are declared and 
excursions are run. If burning >a hu¬ 
man being at the stake with slow fires 
is not barbarism, what is barbarism? 
Only a few months ago a negro sus¬ 
pected of crime was burned at the stake 
at Corinth, Miss., a town of 2500 in¬ 
habitants. The burning, which was 
well advertised, was postponed till Sun¬ 
day, that being a holiday would, insure 
a larger attendance of the men, women 
and children who had to work. To keep 
the ladies of the high church and so¬ 
cial circles from mingling with the 
common herd a platform near the stake 
was erected Saturday for their accom¬ 
modation. From that platform they 
witnessed unmoved that shocking out¬ 
rage with all of its debasing details, 
except when excited, to applaud a 
sciearn tortured from the victim by the 


application of a red hot iron to his 
nude body. Of these ladies we have no 
criticism to make. We leave them to 
their conscience and their God. 

Where in heathendom can a parallel 
to that crime be found? And yet it is 
only one of fifty similar crimes that 
have taken place in the South in the 
past ten years. The commission of 
such crimes in the South make them 
no blacker, or the people more savage 
than were they committed in the North 
o West. Indeed the people in the 
North or West are more reprehensible 
for allowing such a display of brutal¬ 
ity, for their environments are differ¬ 
ent. The South cannot diminish crime 
by denouncing those who condemn it. 
No section can encourage crime with¬ 
out paying the penalty, murder, rob¬ 
bery, nullification, oppression, cruelty 
and the encouragement of race hate 
will bring an abundant harvest after 
+ heir kind, regardless of the section in 
which the pestilential seeds are sown. 
Because mob law from the South has 
found its way into Northern communi¬ 
ties and turned them into brutes, does 
not justify crimes against human rights, 
in that section. We still believe that 
the wages of sin is death. We still be¬ 
lieve that murder and robbery are 
wrong. Our faith in the ultimate tri¬ 
umph of right is founded upon the 
solid rock of God.’s everlasting 
promises.

PENSIONS FOR EX-SLAVES. 
Confederate Veterans of Fort Worth 
Will Adopt a Resolution Endorsing 
the Hanna Bill. 

(By the Associated Press—P.M.j 
FORT WORTH, Tex., Feb. 8.—At the 
regular meeting today of R. E. Lee 
camp, United Confederate Veterans, a 
resolution indorsing the Senator Hanna 
bill to pension ex-slaves was intro¬ 
duced by State Historian Judge Cum¬ 
mings, and was adopted by an almost 
unanimous vote. Thej*e was some ob- 
pection on the ground that the resolu¬ 
tion might be construed as political. 

The resolution suggests that the 
Texas representatives in congress sup¬ 
port the Hanna measure to the extent 
of rewarding all ex-slaves who re¬ 
mained at home within the ages set 
forth in the bill, or those who went 
with their masters in the Civil War, 
but that those be excepted who were 
enlisted in the United States volunteer 
service and are already on the pens on 
list.

SENATOR PERKINS JOINS TI 
MOB. HE WANTS NO NEGRO 
OFFICE HOLDERS. 

DR. CRUM REJECTED. 

Washington, Feb. 12.—The Senate 
committee on commerce today voted to 
report adversely the nomination of W. 
D. Crum as collector of the port of 
Charleston, S, C. Every Democrat on 
the committee voted against Crum, and 
Senators Perjrins of California and Jones 
of Nevada joined them, making a ma¬ 
jority. 

Perkins said he had looked into the 
matter carefully and had satisfied him¬ 
self that the President had made a mis¬ 
take in appointing a colored man as col¬ 
lector at Charleston. No. Negro does 
business with the custom house, and 
Crum is entirely ignorant of the duties 
of the office, according to Perkins. 

Perkins said he would not like to have 
a colored collector at San Francisco, 
and respected the feelings of the whites 
at Charleston. 

In voting with Ben Tillman to reject 
Doctor Crum's nomination for collector 
of the port at Charleston, S. C, Senator 
Perkins emphatically endorsed every 
outrage that Tillman and his gang have 
perpetrated upon the negroes. The 
actions of Senator Perkins are not only 
a base betrayal of the colored voters 
of this state but the President as well. 
To desert a pure statesman like Presi¬ 
dent Roosevelt* and the cause for which 
he stands, for the association of a self- 
confessed, cold-blooded murderer, and 
ballot thief ,as Tillman -says he is, is so 
out of harmony with the actions of de¬ 
cent mankind, that one is at a loss to 
define Senator Perkins’ actions. 1 

But Senator Perkins is not the first 
California Republican that betraved the 
colored voters of this country at a time 
when they, most needed a friend. Judge 
McKenna, associate justice of the.U. S. 
Supreme Court, put himself on record 
as an enemy of the Negroes by banding 
.down a decision upholding the infamous 
disf ranch is : ng constitution of Missis¬ 
sippi. Aside from drawing his salary 
this is all that he has done or ever 
will do that will prevent the memory of 
him from sleeping in the obscurity from 
which lie should never have been 
dragged. ' 

The Uni led States .Senate has been 
regarded as a place of evil • association 
ever since the admission of Ben 'rill- 


man, but his manners have been so 
coarse and his actions so offensive that 
they have generally kept self-respecting 
senators at bay. But after Senator Per- 
kins broke his pledges to the people of 
his state, it was easy for him to join 
Ben Tillman in their fight to thwart the 
progress of the Negroes. Notice is here¬ 
by served upon Ben and his whole mob, 
including Senator Perkins, that their 
fight upon the Negroes is a losing fight. 
We have God and all of the good white 
people on our side. 


OUR COTTAGES BY THE SEA. 

At Santa Monica,, that beautiful city 
by the sea, our people are not behind 
in the acquisition of this world's goods. 
There are ,not many of thepji but , what 
they lack in numbers they make up in 
push and pluck. They all work and 
nearly all of them own their homes, sup¬ 
plemented in many cases with a snug 
little bank account. This fact is a cer¬ 
tificate of good character. Of their 
comfortable homes for want of space 
we can mention only a few. Corner of 
Colorado and Seventh streets, surround¬ 
ed by ever-blooming rose bushes and 
orange and lemon trees is the neat cot¬ 
tage, of Mr. Ji Walter Moxley. Besides 
the ownership of, a barber shopion tone 
of the principal business streets, , Mr. 
Moxley owns two acres of land in the 
thriving village of Sawtelle, on which 
he raises potatoes and beans*

Mrs. S. A. Wright,’ a widow and pio¬ 
neer resident, owns a beautiful six-room 
cottage, 233 Sixth street. This home, 
provided with all modern conveniences, 
represents a part of what she has accu¬ 
mulated by her own efforts. ' She is a 
prominent member of tlie Woman’s Club 
of this city.

It is gratifying to note the increase in 
the number Of dioftfesuthat' are being 
purchased by the colored citizens and the 
improvement that is being, trt^de T ,upon 
those already (purchased. The good 
work must be kept up fof one of the 
essential needs in our struggle to bet¬ 
ter conditions is the ownership of homes 
and farms. Added to these there must 
be self-respect and race pride. Without 
these things no people can rise. There 
is a growing demand among the colored 
people for small tracts of agricultural 
land and' the number of these holdings 
are increasing rapidly. This is a good sign 
for nothing else offers the colored man 
larger and quicker returns for his labor 
than truck gardening, pdultry and stock 
raising. There is a fortune in sweet 
‘potatoes. Although they are cheaper 
how than they 2 were a few weeks ago, 
they now sell at 10 pounds 'for 25 cents, 
or $1.50 per bushel. 'For a large yield 
of sweet potatoes you dm put the’ soil

AH! THERE, KELLEY. 

There is a rumor which is generally 
credited that Ex.-Rev. Kelley is the 
financial power behind the throne in 
the publication of The Independent, 
that has just made its appearance at 
San Francisco, with R. F. Douglass as 
editor. Douglass is said to be also an 
ex-pulpit m—. Revs. Kelley and Doug¬ 
lass have always been warm personal 
friends, whether in ways crooked or 
straight. We cannot vouch for the 
truthfulness of Kelley’s connection 
with the paper. Douglas boasted while 
here last fall that although Kelley was 
guilty he, Kelley, had plenty of money 
and could not be convicted.. This with 
other scraps of evidence taken together 
give the concern a rank smell of rat 
swallowing and seduction. The rela¬ 
tionship between these preachers? has 
1 een so intimate that they are said on 
good authority to have traveled on the 
same railroad ministerial pass till the 
railroad people got onto the scheme 
and captured the pass while in the pos¬ 
session of Rev.? Kelley-Douglass. Writ¬ 


ing to the paper Rev. Kelley says: 

“Your paper is clean and consistent, 
and it should succeed. My services are 
at your disposal. J. H. KELLEY.” 

This will not help The Independent 
here, where Kelley is known. Those 
who know him best believe strongest in 
his guilt, with the exception of one or 
possibly two dear old feeble-minded 
grandmothers. Sent ment here is un¬ 
animously in favor of his conviction.

ANOTHER SUCKER CAUGHT. 

Judging from the screeching that is 
now emanating from Eagle’s nest, that 
old bird must have caught anotuer 
sucker. That he will be skinned from 
head to tail there is not the slightest 
doubt, for, owing to the scarcity -of 
picnics and fake celebrations, the suck- 
ert trade has been “awful” dull. If all 
reports are true, our esteemed, friend 
Mr. R. C. Owens, left a $20 gold piece 
in the Eagle’s sucker shop to secure a 
bit of information about somebody’s 
business that he could have gotten for 
the asking. It has been noted of late 
that the Eagle man has been sitting 
behind a broad grin, which indicates 
the presence of game in his sucker 
trap. 'Since Owens left that $20 gold 
piece with the Eagle -man he has been 
frequently heard humming 
“When you get a good thing save it, 
save it; 

When you get a-- cat skin ’em to ’s 

tail.” 

Lawyer Hayes of Virginia has been 
roundly condemned by the colored press 
for his remarks before the Afro-Amer¬ 
ican Council at its meeting in Wash¬ 
ington, D. C., some time since. But 
they have offered no word of condem¬ 
nation to the Atlanta Constitution for 
advocating the organization of the Ku 
Klux Klan to murder colored federal 
officeholders. Oh, no; the editor of the 
Constitution is a white man.

EX-SLAVE PENSION. 

The bill introduced in Federal Senate 
by Senator Hanna to pension ex-slaves 
is a worthy measure and should have 
the support of the entire country, espe¬ 
cially the South, which would he the 
greatest beneficiary. The Confederate 
veterans at Fort Worth, Tex., have 
come out unanimously in favor of the 
bill. If their actions are followed by 
the Confederate veterans in other 


Southern states, the bill will become a 
law. On the part of the Southern peo¬ 
ple it would be a graceful act and would 
be a partial reward to the ex-slaves 
for their fidelity to the white women 
and children of the South during the 
dark days of the Civil War. 


$25 TO CALIFORNIA. 

Elsewhere in these columns will be 
found the colonists' rates inaugurated by 
the Southern Pacific R. *R. Company, 
which will be in force for four months. 
Those who have relatives and friends 
in the South and East whom they would 
have migrate to this great state should 
call attention to the low rates now of¬ 
fered. Industrious colored men and 
women who desire to better their condi¬ 
tion will make no mistake. There are 
many opportunities for small farmers 
which bring sure and good returns. No 
state offers colored people better oppor¬ 
tunities or treats them fairer than this 
state does. California is the coming 
state of the Union and if the rate of 
increase in her population continues will 
have a population of ten or twenty mil¬ 
lions at no distant day. For the indus¬ 
trious, economical colored man there are 
many onnortnnities not to be found else¬ 
where. Will they be allowed to slip as 
usual ? 


If the Hanna slave pension bill should 
become a law, what about those old-time 
ex-slaves who did time in Mississippi, 
Alabama and Georgia before the war, 
but who have changed their birthplaces 
to Boston, Mass.; Rochester, N. Y.; 
Oberl'n, Ohio, and Chicago, Ill., since 
they came to California. But wouldn’t 
they miss it?

NEVER SAW A GOOD NIGGER. 

One white man from Texas refused 
to go and hear Booker T. Washington 
speak, giving as his reason that “he 
had never seen a good nigger.” Is there 
anything strange in this? During Mr. 
Washington’s vis t he was lonesome 
as the University club. In their 
rush to do Washington honor the peo¬ 
ple didn’t even leave a greasy spot of 
that club. 

* * * * 

We are not surprised at Senator Per¬ 
kins being against the negroes, but we 
hardly expected to find him against Cal¬ 
ifornia and the president Nothing 
•that Republicans of the Perkins-Jones’ 
stripe do against the negroes can sur¬ 
prise us.

TO PENSION EX-SLAVES. 

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.—Senator 
Hanna today introduced a bill granting 
pensions and bounties to all ex-slaves 
who were freed by the proclamation of 
President Lincoln during the war of 
the Rebellion. It provides that persons 
over 5 years of age and less than 60, 
male or female, shall receive a cash 
bounty of $100, and monthly pension 
of $8 per month; persons between 60 
and 70 years of age, a bounty of $300 
and a pension of $12 per month, and 
persons over 70 years of age a bounty 
•of $700 and a pension of $15 per month. 
The bill also provides for the payment 
of the bounty and pension to relatives 
who may be charged with the care of 
ex-slaves. President Mitchell, of the 
National Industrial council, at whose 
request the bill was introduced, issued 
a statement tonight to the effect that 
no one has the authority to charge the 
petxtioners who will benefit should the 
bill become a law any money to further 
its passage.

A NATIONAL SUFFRAGE CON¬ 
VENTION. 

The agitation for a national suffrage 
convention of the colored citizens to be 
held during the present year should 
succeed The political and other rights 
of the negro is progressing backwards. 
His rights are abridged in the same 
proportion that his ignorance and pov¬ 
erty decreases. The disfranchising con¬ 
stitutions and jim crow car laws are not 
enacted to degrade the ignorant, worth¬ 
less class. If the negro does not offer 
a protest to the wholesale nullification 
of his constitutional rights that is now 
going on, his silence will be construed 
as acquiescence on his part. A people 
that will not contend for their God- 
given rights rarely ever receive them as 
an act of charity. This crime of the 
century should be kept before the coun¬ 
try. The great body of the American 
people believe in honesty and fair play 
It is only a small minority who, by 
nullification and. other acts of lawless¬ 
ness, admit their inability to compete 
with the negro unless he is ^chained 
hand and foot. The crime of nullifi¬ 
cation, like slavery, cannot stand agita¬ 
tion. Let us have the convention made 
up of representatives from every sec¬ 
tion of the country, with the office- 
seeker left out as largely as possible, as 
he is generally a truckling time-server 
only a little better than the average 
negro office-holder.

WON’T HAVE A NEGRO FOR MAIL 
CARRIER. 

AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 24.—The house of 
representives today refused to adopt 
a resolution providing for the employ- • 
ment of a negTo to carry the mails ' 
from the postoffice to the capitol, ob¬ 
jection to the employment of a negro 
being made on the ground that it would 
be improper in view of the Democratic 
party’s pronounced stand against the 
appointment of negroes to fill official 
places In the South.
