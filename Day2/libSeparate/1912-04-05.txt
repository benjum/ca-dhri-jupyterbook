Now is Not the Time to Forget, but to 
Remember Brownsville 

BURY ROOSEVELT AT THE PRIMARIES AND BEAT TAFT AT THE POLLS. 


At a meeting of colored bishops 
ancl clergymen held recently in 
the east, they issued a manifesto 
to the colored voters telling why 
Roosevelt should be nominated. 
They flayed president Taft and his 
“infamous” Southern Negro poilicy. 
and referred to Brownsville as 
Col. Roosevelt's “hasty act.” The 
following editorial, from the pen 
of William M. Trotter of “Boston 
Guardian,” reflects the sentiment 
of tens • of thousands of Negro 
voters in the close states. 

Referring to the last paragraph 
of the maifesto, “The Guardian” 
says: 

“We regard this as the most 
remarkable, if not the most scan¬ 
dalous, document yet. We do not 
refer to the censure of president 
Taft. He will have to look to 
others for any defense. It is the 
defense and eulogy of ex-president 
Roosevelt and appeal to give him 
another nomination for the presi¬ 
dency that is remarkable, and scan¬ 
dalous, as well as to seek to defeat 
the renomination of one objection¬ 
able man by another who is the 
political father of the former. 

Theodore Roosevelt left the presi¬ 
dency deservedly a thoroughly dis¬ 
liked and despised man in the eyes 
of Colored Americans. To seek 
to thus defeat President Taft, 
however hostile to our interests, 
is the height of absurdity and worse. 
To be sure, President Taft may have 
gone further than President Roose¬ 
velt in outlining color line, policies 
and without excuse, but it was 
President Rooseyelt who inaugu¬ 
rated this Southern policy, this 


seeking of Southern white favor 
at the Colored man's expense, and 
it was only by adopting this line 
of policy that Secretary Taft could 
get the favor and support of Presi¬ 
dent Roosevelt and thus become 
president. What nonsense to 
seek to get rid of the apt pupil 
by bringing back the guilty teacher. 

Comparison of Roosevelt and 
Taft is hair-splitting folly. Roose¬ 
velt was such an enemy of justice 
and liberty for Colored" Americans 
that he ought never to be allowed 
even to get into the presidential 
race if colored people can help 
it. The Brownsville discharge is 
a blow at the race of such injustice 
and brutality that its author 
should be forever opposed by every 
Colored man. Call it a “hasty”? 
act—why even Secretary Taft, his 
subordinate, cabled him to with¬ 
draw or modify. “Hasty”! Did 
he not for two long years persist 
in it, and increase its injustice by 
denouncing all who appealed to 
him, by using the whole resources 
of the government to keep these 
soldiers from having an equal 
chance in the hearings? Did he 
not make as the price of his sup¬ 
port of Taft that he should sup¬ 
port this outrage? And did he 
not insist on the political death and 
ruin of Senator Foraker because 
he fought for a fair hearing for 
these soldiers? 

What? Give another presiden¬ 
tial nomination to Theodore 
Roosevelt, who praised the rebel 
soldiers, who boasted of the fewness 
of his Southern appointments, who 
declared the Colored South should 


emphasize duties, not rights; who 
made Southern democrats the pat¬ 
ronage receivers; who had Hitch¬ 
cock and McHarg absolutely dis¬ 
franchise the Colored men within 
the Republican party; who now 
has McHarg, the lily-whiter, getting 
him Southern delegates; who wrote 
the Virginian that no one, North 
or South, had the least idea of 
enforcing the 14th amendment; 
who was the author and persistent 
prosecutor of the Brownsville dis¬ 
charge? 

Never! Taft is the logical Re¬ 
publican for the nomination, and 
should have it unless a good man 
can beat him. The place for his 
Colored opponents to down him 
is at the polls. But the thing to 
do with Roosevelt is not even to 
let him have the satisfaction of 
another nomination. Bury him 
forever at the primaries. No mercy 
for the author of Brownsville. 
Now is not the time to forget, 
but to remember Brownsville. 


The above from “The Guardian” 
speaks for itself. There is no deny¬ 
ing the fact that there are thousands 
of Negro voters all over the coun¬ 
try quietly waiting for an oppor¬ 
tunity to fight Roosevelt to a 
finish. There is no telling what 
would result from the storm that 
Col. Roosevelt’s nomination would 
raise. President Taft’s Southern 
Negro policy and his position on 
the kind of education Negroes should 
have, willcost him the Negro vote 
of the close states and what 
Brownsville would do for Roosevelt 
is hard to tell.

THE LIBERATOR 



REV. J. E. EDWARDS WHO IS 
STRONGLY ENDORSED 
FOR SECRETARY OF MIS¬ 
SIONS. 

Los Angeles, Cal., March 9th, 1912. 
Hon. J. L. Edmonds, 

Editor, The Liberator, 

Los Angeles, Cal. 

Dear Sir:— 

The great A. M. E. Church, 
which will convene in its 25th 
quadrennial session at Kansas City 
in May, will have before it a mul¬ 
titude of candidates, all of whom 
are worthy and deserving, if the 
praises being sung by the ravious 
writers can be relied upon. 

It would be but in keeping with 
the great progress of the church 
that the selection of men, for the 
various offices to be filled, be a 
matter centering entirely upon their- 
fitness and not a question of geo¬ 
graphy, policy or popularity. 

It seems that every conference 
and Episcopal District, almost 
every quarterly conference and pre¬ 
siding elder’s district, has one or 
more favorites for this or that 
office to be contended for at our 
approaching General Conference. 

The church is fortunate and is 
to be congratulated upon the fact 
that she posseses such an array of 
capable and useful men from which 


to select her spiritual and temporal 
leaders. 

This indicates a healthy and 
prosperous condition. It increases 
our responsibility to God and hu¬ 
manity. 

It is imperative that due care 
be exercised in the selection of 
men to leadership in the church 
of God. Three things are neces¬ 
sary to be considered before a 
choice for any office should be made: 

God’s will, the needs of the church 
and the individuals fitness. 

I am just old-fashioned enough 
to believe that the Holy Ghost 
should have something to do with 
the choosing of leaders in the church. 

Long before the voting hour 
the Holy Ghost should say: “Sepa¬ 
rate for the work whereunto I 
have called.” I believe as firmly 
in divine call to leadership as I do 
in a divine call to the ministry. 

This being our faith we should 
not become nervous just previous 
to an election and place our trust 
in the uncertain methods of poli¬ 
tics. I suggest with all candor 
and seriousness that a day spent 
in fasting and prayer would be 
worth more than 365 days of 
political wire-pulling. 

I have in mind a man whom I 
believe it would please God to 
elect as Secretary of Missions. I 
feel certain the church would be 
greatly benefitted by such action. 

I mention Rev. J. E. Edwards, 
of the Kansas Conference. He is 
eminently fitted for the position 
by education experience and moral 
worth. He gives to us the rich 
scholarship of a Howard Univer¬ 
sity graduate and the accomplish¬ 
ments of a successful pastor in 
Texas, California and Kansas. His 
ministry everywhere has been 
characterized by hard work and 
splendid results. Should he put 
the energy and enthusiasm into 
the missionary work of the church, 
that he has given to the itineracy, 
the department will meet with 
unprecedented success. He is a 
man capable only of doing his 
best and he has never failed to 
push the cause higher. His labors 
in Denison, Dallas, Galveston and 
Waco, Texas, established his fame 


as a workman, who need not be 
ashamed. 

Two churches were saved from 
the sheriff’s hammer in Dallas, 
the membership increased and a 
large Sunday school built up. 

At the mother church in Galves¬ 
ton ,over $12,000 was paid and the 
debt cleared on the beautiful brick 
structure during his administra¬ 
tion there. 

All California adores the smil¬ 
ing, patient, toiling, zealous preach¬ 
er and teacher of righteousness. 
His work in Oakland, where he 
built up, strengthened and advanc¬ 
ed in efficiency and numbers the 
several departments of this im¬ 
portant charge and afterward the 
memorable achievements of seven 
eventful years in the lovely city 
of Los Angeles, where he erected 
another magnificent house of wor¬ 
ship have endeared him to the 
ministry and people of the Golden 
State. 

Measuring our favorite by what 
he has done, under the limitations 
of the pastorate, we may fairly 
judge of what may be done by him 
in the larger field of missions. 
No mistake will be made should 
the church honor this noble man 
of God by elevating him to the 
office of Secretary of Missions. 
He is well qualified in every par¬ 
ticular and will undoubtedly make 
good. 

I know you to be interested in 
putting good men to the front and 
if you can find opportunity to help 
our friend and brother you will 
greatly oblige, Yours truly, 

D. R. JONES.

of heart failure last Friday. He 
was highly respected by all who 
knew him and his funeral services, 
which took place at his late resi¬ 
dence, 1366 East 18th street, on 
the first, were attended by a large 
crowd of sorrowing friends. The 
floral offerings were beautiful. As¬ 
sisted by Rev. E. W. Kenchin, 
Rev. C. H. Anderson, his old friend 
and pastor, pronounced a touching 
funeral eulogy. Although lying 
cold in death, in his beautiful casket, 
Mr. Elgin looked the picture of 
health. 

Besides a host of friends he leaves 
a widow and four sons and two 
daughters to mourn his loss. 

Interment was made at Ever¬ 
green cemetery. A. J. Roberts & 
Sons, undertakers, had charge. 

We extend to the bereaved 
family oursincere sympathy.

A GREAT MASS MEETING 


The mass meeting at Blanchard's 
Hall on the 27th of March, was 
a great success. A big crowd, re¬ 
presenting every precinct of the 
city and many from the country, 
turned out. The speeches were 
powerful arraingments of the nar¬ 
row, unmanly actions of certain 
members of the Board of Super¬ 
visors in drawing the color line 
in a public institution. The feel¬ 
ings that that meeting aroused in 
the minds of the voters will tell 


disastrously against the men re¬ 
sponsible for that mean attempt 
to close the door of hope to the 
young, intelligent Negro women. 
The effect of that meeting in calling 
the attention of the voters and 
lovers of justice to the danger 
that is threatening their rights 
will be tremendous. Every person 
who visited that meeting and heard 
those speeches came away resolved 
to fight to the end the authors of 
that outrage. The man responsi¬ 
ble for that un-Christian, un-Ameri¬ 
can attempt to close the door in 
the face of women on account of 
the color of their skin, must be 
voted out of office at the primaries. 
Thank Heaven, this is not a race 
question, but one of justice. These 
men have proven their unfitness 
to hold public office. 

That meeting, composed as it 
Tvas of men and women of both 
races, and several nationalities, 
opened the battle for justice and 
will win. 


THE MOB’S LESSON 


The recent outrage by which a 
whole court was wiped out in Vir¬ 
ginia and three men killed and the 
shooting and head-smashing of 
others at Rock Island, Ill., ought 
to serve as an eye-opener to our 
white citizens. They have en¬ 
couraged and defended mobs; they 
have given them the protection 
of the courts and in a humorous 
vein, the daily papers have told 
of the mob's inhuman, bloody 
deeds as if they were deeds of hero¬ 
ism. Because the victims were 
Negroes, courts, court officers and 
juries perjured themselves to free 
the mobs that brutally murdered 
them. As the result of this whole¬ 
sale perjury by sworn officers of the 
law, mobs have no respect for laws 
or courts. Mobs having from ex¬ 
perience, .regarded the officers of 
the law as their mainstay when 
they murdered Negroes, don't 
propose to be deserted by the said 
officers, when white men become 


victims, hence the annihilation of 
that Va. court. Flo} 7 d Allen 
killed a Negro and was sentenced 
to pay a small fine and spend two 
hours in jail. He got a new trial 
and was discharged. For assualt- 
ing an officer of the law and forcing 
him to set free a prisoner, he (Al¬ 
len) was given % year in the peni¬ 
tentiary. It w is the attempt to 
enforce this ser fence that lead to 
the lynching of the court. 

Virginia dese ves no sympathy 
The chickens v ent home to roost 
They also wenl home to roost at 
Rock Island, IBs., the other day. 

A court that liberates a mobs that 
murders Negrc ss, will have to 
discharge them when they murder 
white men or suffer the conse¬ 
quences. Is it not the mob's conclu¬ 
sions just?

The waves that have touched the 
lips that are cold 
Rise up from the heart of the deep; 
With curving and groaning, 

With folding and maoning, 

They sink in the sands at my feet. 
I mourn with the mourning waters 
tonight, 

My tears are mixed with the sea. 
In the eddies and whirls, 

In the twining and swirls 
They mingle and scatter and flee. 
My tears on the sands, my sighs on 
the winds, 

Are lost as they flutter and fall. 
With a heart full of sighing, 

A voice full of crying, 

I answer the sea's restless call!
