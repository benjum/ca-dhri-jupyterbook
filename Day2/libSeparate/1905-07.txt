THE LIBERATOR. 


The Revolutionary Fathers and the 
Men of ’61 Fought in Vain un¬ 
less Mob Violence is suppressed 
says Hon. Will A. Harris, Old 
Veterans Cheer Him on Decora- 
Day. 

Mr. Harris said: 

Deep and strong were the founda¬ 
tions of this republic laid by strong 
men and strong women, men and wo¬ 
men who loved freedom and justice 
more than they loved gold. They 
planted a dominant, virile civilization 
in the wilderness. They profoundly 
understood that “to be free is to live 
under a government by lawAnd, my 
countrymen, every page of history en¬ 
forces this thonght, spoken by one 
of the world’s greatest judges. Every 
day since God with plastic hand mold¬ 
ed the sun and stars and set them 
moving with incredible swiftness 
through space, has taught the lesson 
“to be free is to live under a gov¬ 
ernment by law.” Behold the stars 
moving in majestic procession across 
the heavens at midnight! Order is 
there, law is there. 

Law must be supreme. Those na¬ 
tions who have made their own laws 
and obeyed them are the nations that 
have achieved greatness, and, my 
countrymen, loving this republic as 
I do, because it has given me oppor¬ 
tunity for the fullest achievement and 
because its flag protects my wife and 
my children, venerating it because of 
its heroes, statesmen and philosophers 
and its splendid history, I solemnly 
say to you that the first duty of a 
citizen, a duty that should never be 
forgotten, is to obey its laws and to 
sternly condemn those who violate 
them. Appalling and atrocious crimes 
may be committed. It is then that 
reason should dominate the councils 
of men. 

Mob violence—anarchy has in re¬ 
cent times disgraced many communi¬ 
ties, both in the North and in the 
South. In the beginning it was re¬ 
sorted to in most cases to wreak ven¬ 
geance upon the perpetrators of an 
unnamable and fearful offense against 
the laws of God and man, but during 
the past year nearly three-fourths of 
the lynchings have been for other 
crimes. 


Unless this spirit of anarchy can 
be checked, where will it end? 

Nearly all the victims of mob vio¬ 
lence are black men. 

I say to you that white men should 
never forget that the negro is an in¬ 
voluntary inhabintant of this country. 

That his ancestors were brought 
here manacled in slave ships. That 
he was kept in slavery and in ignor¬ 
ance until Abraham Lincoln set him 
free. 

That for weal or woe, he is here, 
and here he will remain, and that he 

is not to blame for being here. 

It should be remembered, too, that 
ours is the dominant race. That we 
have from the beginning made the 
laws, that we make them now, and 
their enforcement is in our hands. 

These things being true, it is our 
solemn duty, not alone for his good, 
but for our own, to teach him that 
there must be obedience to the law. 

That its violation will bring cer¬ 
tain and swift punishment. 

And how can we better teach him 
that lesson than by rigidly doing that 
which we require of him? These 
lynchings are creating race hatred. 

They are planting in the minds of 
the negroes a feeling of mistrust and 
a desire for revenge that some day 
will bring sorrow and ruin and blood¬ 
shed to both races unless moved by 
a wise patriotism and an earnest de¬ 
sire to do justice, we can find some 
means of staying the progress of this 
race hatred that threatens the peace 
and well-being of society in many of 
the commonwealths of the republic. 

In these latter days has come a 
mighty struggle between labor and 
capital. A struggle that has brought 
poverty and distress and suffering to 
tens of thousands of our fellow-citi¬ 
zens—that has caused bloodshed and 
bitterness and hate where harmonious 
relations should exist. Shallow, self¬ 
ish, unreflecting demagogues confuse 
the public mind by “words without 
wisdom” and appeals to passion on 
this, as upon every other great ques¬ 
tion affecting the public weal or woe. 

One thing must be borne in mind, 
because it is the essence of all that 
has been achieved by the fathers, and 
that is a man is born free in Amer¬ 
ica, and as long as he is protected by 
the stars and stripes he shall remain 
free—free to think, act and express 


himself as he sees fit, so long as he 
violates no law and does not encroach 
upon the rights of his fellow-men. 

This is fundamental, and unless it 
can be maintained the Revolutionary 
fathers, and you, the men of 1861, 
who, when your country was threaten¬ 
ed fearlessly faced death in its de¬ 
fense and deemed it a glorious privi¬ 
lege to offer up your lives upon its 
altar, drew your swords in vain. 


THE MISSISSIPPI COLONY. 

The Mississippi Colony here is re¬ 
ceiving many valuable acquisitions 
from that peonage ridden state. The 
newcomers are representatives of the 
best class, are men and women of 
means. In business they have been mi- 
nently successful in Mississippi, and 
they would have been pleased to have 
remained there, but conditions have 
grown intolerable for self-respecting 
negroes. They are well pleased with 
California. 

Mr. Eugene Stricklin, wife and 
niece, Mrs. E. Henderson, Miss Nina 
Stewart and Mr. Shaw, recently of 
Natchez, Miss., and Mr. L. L. Stewart, 
wife and daughter of this city, spent 
the Fourth at the Edmunds villa. It 
was a Mississippi reunion, and a pleas¬ 
ant time was had all around. Mrs. 
Henderson runs a millinery establish¬ 
ment in Natchez, and is prominent in 
the business and social circles of that 
city. Mrs. Henderson is a self-made 
woman, having been reared without 
mother or father. Her grandmother, 
who died a few years ago, after living 
more than a century, belonged to Gen. 
George Washington’s family and met 
many of the statesmen of Gen. Wash¬ 
ington’s time, including Gen. Lafay¬ 
ette. 


In calling attention to the inconsist¬ 
ency and general unworthiness of the 
Afro-American Council, so called, we 
want it understood that personally we 
have no ill feelings towards the gen¬ 
tlemen whose names appear in connec¬ 
tion with what has been said. We criti¬ 
cize their official acts only. As long 
as they claim that the Council is a race 
organization their acts as officers are 
the property of the race. Just as soon 
as they throw off their cloak and give 
the public to understand that the Coun¬ 
cil belongs to them and not to the race, 
the race’s responsibility ceases, and 
The Liberator’s fight is off. This Coun¬ 
cil has no charter because the officers 
could not raise money enough to pay 
for it without going into their own 
pockets. This they never do.

The Afro-American Leg Pullers At¬ 
tempted to Raid the City Tues¬ 
day. The Old Gang getting 
Desperate. 

The election of Mr. Alexander as 
president of the American Council, so- 
called, was a flank movement on the 
part of the old six-bits grafters to 
use his good name to work their graft 
on the unsuspecting public. We 
warned Mr. Alexander of it at the 
time, but it seems that he could not 
free himself from the serpentine 
charms of the human leeches that 
make up the gang. The Liberator’s 
relentless war upon the gang and its 
disgraceful methods not only made its 
occupation profitless but brought the 
gang face to face with the alternative 
of looking an honest day’s labor in 
the face or going hungry—in either 
case to the push a thing of untold 
horror. It was either to get up some 
new scheme to beat the public in the 
name of the Negroes or return to the 
shovel and the hoe. 

It was here the happy thought of 
electing Alexander president and get 
a new lease on life broke upon their 
work-dodging visions. As soon as the 
scheme was carried out one of the 
grafters had the brazen effrontery to 
state to the reporter of one of the 
daily papers that “he as state lec¬ 
turer would have charge of every¬ 
thing, as Alexander was an elevator 
man and could not leave his job,’’ thus 
trying to minify the head and magnify 
the tail. Mr. Alexander was called 
into the scheme to make the league 
the private property of Prince Neimore 
& Co. by cutting down the represen¬ 
tation so as to perpetuate their graft. 
We believed all along and believe yet 
that Alexander is the innocent victim 
of seekers after ill-gotten gains on one 
hand and seekers after cheap notoriety 
on the other, and all at the expense 
of the race’s good name. 


attempt to raid the city 

TREASURY. 

The people have become so accus¬ 
tomed to the schemes of these profes¬ 
sional “leg pullers” to beat the public 
that no device was thought too wicked 
• for them to adopt to win bread with¬ 
out work, but the bold attempt to 


make a raid on the city treasury came 
as a surprise and shocked the whole 
black population. How that gang got 
Mr. Alexander to sign a petition ask¬ 
ing the city council or any other white 
person for money to entertain the so- 
called Afro-American Congress, which 
is to kill time at Pasadena next month, 
is past the understanding of his 
friends. Who ordered the circulation 
of that petition? For what purpose 
was the money to be used? There will 
be only ten or fifteen persons at the 
so-called congress and the good citi¬ 
zens of Pasadena have agreed to tax 
their patience once more to entertain 
that time-killing, graft-seeking gang, 
in the vain hope that it may yet he re¬ 
claimed for some useful occupation. 
Of course, including those who are at¬ 
tracted by curiosity and those in 
search of a free lunch may give them 
more, from time to time, but the brain 
and brawn—the business and profes¬ 
sional men who are conducting and 
supporting race enterprises—will not 
be delegates. What was that money 
for? is a question self-respecting Afro- 
American want answered since it was 
asked for in heir names. They did not 
ask for it. In this city and Pasadeha 
there are at least 6,000 Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans, owning over a million dollars' 
worth of real and personal property. 
If the so-called Afro-American Council 
is a race organization guarding the 
welfare of the said 6,0000 Afro-Ameri¬ 
cans, is it not a reflection upon their 
intelligence to ask the white people 
for money to entertain the Afro-Ameri¬ 
can Congress? The truth of the mat¬ 
ter is, as we have said time and time 
again, that the league does not repre¬ 
sent the thoughtful, intelligent, enter¬ 
prising, progressive members of the 
race, or they would be delegates to the 
congress and would defray their own 
expenses. This the gang knows and 
dare not go to them for money; hence 
the barefaced attempt to hold up the 
city treasury, and this too in the name 
of the Afro-Americans. 

The colored business men, lawyers, 
doctors and preachers, as leaders, 
ought to openly denounce this outrage. 
Have they the backbone? How long 
are these grafters to continue beating 
the public in the name of the Afro- 
Americans?

tan Club Strike It Rich in 
Goldfields. 

Goldfields, June 20, 1905. 
Mr. Edmunds: 

Dear Sir: It gives me great pleas¬ 
ure to write you a few lines to let you 
know how Mac and I are getting on. 
This is the greatest country we were 
ever in, for gold. The people are go¬ 
ing almost crazy—some are doing well 
and every one is making a living. Mac 
and I are printing a paper and we 
seem to be getting there in fine shape 
—have a circulation of 1500 already. 
We are taking ads. from Los Angeles 
and even from San Francisco. 

Water is very scarce here. It costs 
$5 for enough to take a bath, but most 
of us do not take baths, and we save 
quite a little that way. We have many 
saloons and one church. Mac went to 
church last Sunday and when they 
passed the plate for collection, Mac 
put in a $5 gold piece. He did not 
notice it until he got home, and he was 
greatly worried over it. However, he 
consoled himself by saying it was for 
a good cause. He said “it was for 
heaven, to h— with it.” Mac has not 
touched a drop since coming up here. 
He took up some good claims, and has 
saved ajout $5000, He is going back 
to Los Angeles soon to get a large 
cylinder press and more type and a 
big stock of paper. We have taken 
up a number of claims here, and yester¬ 
day I sold one to a Los Angeles com¬ 
pany for $14,500, and they are sending 
for a large amount of machinery. 

Send me a Liberator when you can, 
for I always liked to read it. I will 
send you a copy each week of our pa¬ 
per. I do most of the writing. Mac 
writes the editorials and superintends 
the paper. The miners take a great 
interest in the paper, and some of 
them take and pay for as many as a 
dozen to send East. Of course, we 
give them a little write-up, and they 
are much pleased. Will write again 
soon. JAKE. 


w Mob violence has broken out again 
in the South. In Georgia recently nine 
men were stood against a fence and 
shot down like so many fat hogs. It 
is difficult to conceive how this Chris¬ 
tian nation can tolerate such depravity. 
Where will it end?

AFRO-AMERICAN CONGRESS. 

James M. Alexander, president of 
the Afro-American Congress for Cali¬ 
fornia, has issued the call for this an¬ 
nual gathering. It will be held m 
Pasadena August 7. An interesting 
feature of the congress will be presen¬ 
tation of facts and statistics showing 
advancement by members of the 
Negro race, the numbers engaged m 
commercial enterprises in this state, 
and reports on the success of Negroes 
in new commercial lines. There will 
be an industrial department, in charge 
of William Prince, in which Negroes 
will exhibit their shill in the arts and 
crafts.—The Times. 

To the uninitiated the above has 
the appearance of business, but the so- 
called Afro-American Council has no 
existence in law or fact- It has no 
charter so far as we can learn. The 
only charter held by a race organiza¬ 
tion is held by the American League. 
This Afro-American Council, so-called, 
is composed of its officers and a few 
cohorts held together for the purpose 
of graft and graft only. This so-called 


Afro-American Council has fathered no 
scheme or proposition to advance the 
moral and material interest of the 
race. It has not indorsed by word, 
deed or resolution a single race enter¬ 
prise. It has fathered no scheme to 
aid members of race in securing homes 
and employment, although something 
of the kind is urgently needed to re¬ 
lieve colored immigrants who have 
been coming here in great numbers 
for the past two years. The officers 
of this Council patronize no race en¬ 
terprises and can not show receipt or 
other evidence for any money paid 
colored business men for goods pur¬ 
chased in the past 12 months. They 
read no race papers unless they get 
them free. They slip around now 
among business people gathering sta¬ 
tistics of what has been done that they 
may filch the credit from the rightful 
owners. Because colored business men 
are succeeding wiethout their patron¬ 
age or encouragement they hope to 
get a little cheap notoriety by holding 
up the achievements of others and ex¬ 
claiming, “See what we have done, 
and for no other purpose than to open 
new avenues for grafting. No, this 
Council has no existence in law, has 
no membership, no charter, no object 
but graft, and no man with future as¬ 
pirations will jeopardize his chances 
by allowing himself to he elected to an 
office in this so-called Afro-American 
Council, which really means, measured 
by its tactics, Afro-American conspir¬ 
ators. 

It is regarded by intelligent Afro- 
Americans as the receptacle for dead 
ones. 


zens by mobs, but pharisaically dodged 
lest some law breaker be offended. Of 
course, the victims of the mob are 
black; that makes all the differense. 
It is useless to condemn minor offenses 
so long as murder is winked at or con¬ 
doned. Those ministers of the gospel 
who have nothing to say against and 
infractions of the golden rule, because 
the victims are members of a certain 
race or color, can not hope to wield 
influence against crime of any kind. 
That’s why murder, intemperance, di¬ 
vorce, licentiousness and graft ramify 
every stratum of society. That’s why 
Sabbath desecration is so prevalent. 
That’s why the theater and Sunday 
excursion can get more attendants than 
the churches. 


Elsewhere in these columns we pub¬ 
lish an excerpt from the able speech 
delivered at the Soldiers Home on 
Dcoration Day by Hon. Will A. Har¬ 
ris. His plea for the supremacy of the 
law was timely and pointed and was 
enthusiastically cneered by the im¬ 
mense audience that heard it. He said 
in substance that unless mob violence 
is suppressed it will bring on another 
war 

On that same day and since, many 
prominent men addressed the Ameri¬ 
can people on the evils that beset the 
country, graft being most soundly 
threshed, but not one of these minis¬ 
ters of God uttered a word against 
the wholesale murder of American citi- 


THE WHITE MAN’S BATTLE. 

“Russia is fighting the white man’s 
battle” was the cry of every pro- 
Russian newspaper only a short time 
ago, but a wonderful change in the 
tone of those journals are noted of 
late. They now intimate that Japan 
is fighting the white man’s battle, for 
already millions of white men whose 
necks have been under the heel of op¬ 
pression for centuries are being lifted 
up. The light from the bursting shells 
at Fort Arthur and Mukden lighted up 
pathways through the long night of 
oppression for liberty. 

The deafening crash of the artillery 
has cracked the walls enclosing the 
Czar’s palace and enabled him to hear 
the cry of the oppressed people of 
his mighty empire. White men speak 
for liberty on the streets of his cities 
who hut a few weeks ago were afraid 
to think of it less they be sent in 
chains to die in the coal mines of 
Siberia. The struggle between liberty 
and slavery is now on in Russia and 
though it takes years and rivers of 
blood liberty is going to win. Truly, 
the Japanese are fighting not only the 
white man’s but humanity’s battle. 
Russia has fought and lost the op¬ 
pressor’s battle. She has fought and 
lost the battle of those who believe 
it the divine right of the strong to 
rob and oppress the weak under what¬ 
ever pretext that will best suit the 
occasion. Surely God has chosen the 
righteous heathen to liberate his peo¬ 
ple—the oppressed—from the merciless 
thralldom of the unrighteous Chris¬ 
tian. The days of those who use the 
Christian religion as a cloak to do vio¬ 
lence to rights of the weak are num¬ 
bered. The inauguration of the war 
in the East was one of the events in 
1904 which has moved the world 
along. 

The opportunity of the Russian peo¬ 
ple to secure their liberty has come. 
There is no sacrifice too great to make 
for liberty. It is a crime to spare 
any life that stands in its way. “War. 
is hell,” but through it all paths from 
slavery to freedom lead.

LEST WE FORGET. 

Under the caption of “No Coloniza¬ 
tion” in our June number we pointed 
out some of the dangers to which the 
Negroes expose themselves by segre¬ 
gation. Have the Negroes forgotten 
the mob outrages at Joplin, Mo., and 
Evansville, Ind.? In the cities men¬ 
tioned the Negroes own many fine 
residences and up-to-date business 
houses and pay thousands in taxes 
for the suport of the state and city 
governments, which give them no pro¬ 
tection whatever against the depreda¬ 
tions of lawless white cutthroats. 
Take the Joplin case: The police de¬ 
partment was called upon to arest a 
lot of tramps who were stealing a ride 
in a freight car, among whom was a 
Negro. The brutal officer proceeded 
to beat the Negro with his club for 
riding in a car with white men. The 
Negro drew a revolver and killed him, 
as he richly deserved. He was arrest¬ 
ed and turned to a mob, which tor¬ 
tured him to death. Not satisfied, the 
mob went to the Negro section, set it 
on fire and at the point of shotguns 
and clubs drove out the Negroes with¬ 
out regard to age, sex or condition and 
forced them to spend that winter night 
in a Missouri forest, with no other 
protection from cold than that given 
by the frosty sky. The next day that 
prosperous section, representing the 
struggles and sacrifices of many years, 
was a sea of smoky cinders and its 
inhabitants of a few hours before, al¬ 
though known to be guilty of no crime, 
without food or shelter were hiding 
or fleeing to other parts like so many 
escaped convicts. Heartbroken over 
treatment and losses many of them 
never returned and sought refuge else¬ 
where to struggle for another home. 
The Negroes of Joplin knew nothing 
of the killing till after it was done. 
The Negro who did the killing was a 
stranger, havng just arrived in the 
manner stated above, his coming hav¬ 
ing been telegraphed ahead by the 
railroad people. The burning of the 
Negro section was to them a total loss, 
as the insurance companies refused to 
pay premiums. Had those homes been 
scattered among the white residences 
not one of them would have been 
touched. 

In Evansville, Ind., a brutal Negro 
tough killed a brutal white policeman 
in a pistol duel, which was opened by 


the policeman. The murderer and sev¬ 
eral innocent negroes were lodged in 
jail. A mob, with the support of most 
of the officers, formed to lynch them— 
guilty and innocent. The cry “lynch 
the Negroes, burn up the Negro sec¬ 
tion was raised. Nothing saved the 
Negroes and their section from de¬ 
struction but their prompt actions in 
turning it into a fort and giving the 
mob to understand that they would 
die with their rifles smoking in de¬ 
fense of their homes and families. The 
authorities offered them no protection 
whatever. The troops were called 
out and many of the mob shot down 
only when its members commenced 
looting stores of white merchants. If 
that mob had visited the Negro sec¬ 
tion scores of them would have bit¬ 
ten the dust, which would have re¬ 
sulted in the extermination of the 
Negroes. In neither case had a white 
woman been raped by a Negro; in 
neither case the Negroes offered pro¬ 
tection to the criminal. The outrages 
at Joplin and Evansville have been 
perpetrated upon the Negroes at many 
other cities and can be perpetrated in 
any city in this country. The element 
and sentiment that formed those mobs 
is present everywhere. So successful 
have been the propagators of mob vio¬ 
lence that the life of the Negro is un¬ 
safe wherever floats the stars and 
stripes. 

’Tis a pity 'tis true. 


OUR NATIONAL SIN. 


Preaching in New York on Sunday 
evening, in the Scotch Presbyterian 
Church, Rev. David G. Wylie said: 

“Greed for gold is almost universal 
in America. To use an offensive term, 
‘graft’ seems everywhere. This craze 
for wealth leads to cheating, stealing, 
lying and many immoral features in 
business life. 

“Here in New York, men have tar¬ 
nished their names by the manner in 
which they have dealt with the trust 
funds of a great institution. Men, well 
known, respected, high in commercial 
and social station, have taken fire into 
their hands, and it has burned them 
to the quick. We have had an exhibi¬ 
tion of ‘high finance’ pushed to the 
limit. We need to imitate the munici¬ 
pal authorities of Glasgow in the bank 
scandal, where directors of high stand¬ 
ing were sent behind prison bars. 


“The trial and conviction of guilty 
men who have not scrupled to use 
wrongfully other peoples’ money would 
do much to restore confidence in the 
majesty of law; for law ought to deal 
in the same manner with rich and 
poor. 

“Even at the risk of being called 
sensational, X affirm from this Chris¬ 
tian pulpit that the President of the 
United States, in his dealing with 
grasping corporations, and ex-Presi- 
dent Cleveland, Paul Morton, State 
Superintendent of Insurance Hen¬ 
dricks, Atty.-Gen. Mayer and Dist- 
Atty..Jerome have the opportunity of 
'heir lives to serve hundreds of thou¬ 
sands of their fellow-citizens by right¬ 
ing a great wrong.” 

On the same evening, addressing the 
Holy Name Society at the Church of 
the Nativity, in Brooklyn, Rev. J J 
Donlon said: 

“In the business world it is difficult 
to find men who are honest in the 
strict interpretation of the word. 

ithin the past few months we have 
seen financiers to whom the people 
nad unhesitatingly entrusted their 
money exposed as knaves. 

“People are no longer surprised at 
dishonesty in high places. They have 
come to look upon it as a matter of 
course and the phrase ‘tainted money- 
‘ become a byword and a jest We 
are accustomed to breaches of trust 

cfers hT °l ° ffiCeh0lde - finau-' 
ciers, but when we see these men 

show a .ispesitien even to use judges 

of the Supreme Court to further their 

selfish ends it is time to call a halt. 

We see, too, judges hemming and 
lawmg over the cases of these power¬ 
ful wrongdoers, instead of treating 
them as they deserve, 

“Although we may not realize it 
lus is gradually becoming a pagan na¬ 
tion. These evils are permitted to ex¬ 
ist because most men do not perform 
their full civic duty. 

Citizens should not be strict party 
men. They should insist upon honest 
men and honest measures, and vote 
for them without regard to partisan 
bias.” 

The people are awakening to the 
danger that is threatening the nation’s 
life. The present disregard for law 
and the rapid spread of crime is the 
legitimate result of our present na¬ 
tional policy. The country that puts 
commercialism above manhood rights

sets up the golden calf. The tolera- 
tion of lawlessness in any form by the 
government under any pretext sim¬ 
ply puts a premium upon crime 
and reaps the harvest. For this 
country has winked at nullifica¬ 
tion, mob murders and perjury be¬ 
cause the victims were only Negroes, 
unmindful of the fact that crime is 
contagious and that a judge that per- 
jers himself to liberate criminals be¬ 
cause their crimes were committed 
against the live's or rights of Negroes 
will commit the same offense against 
other citizens when the consideration 
offered is deemed sufficient. The gov¬ 
ernment is tolerating today tne crime 
of the century by taxing nine millions 
of people without representation in 
violation of its constitution and of the 
principle upon which it was founded. 
The Negroes are being humiliated and 
handicapped by class legislation from 
one end of the country to the other 
and this with the connivance of the 
federal government. A country that 
tolerates class legislation, nullification, 
color line and jim cars should not ex¬ 
pect to produce anything but law¬ 
breakers and grafters. You can not 
expect a harvest of patriotism unless 
you plant the seed.

THAT SQUARE DEAL. 

That square deal the President 
promised to the country has been 
lived up to in every particular with 
the exception of cutting down South¬ 
ern representation; on this proposi¬ 
tion he shows a disposition to cater to 
Southern sentiment. This plank in 
the platform upon which the President 
was overwhelmingly elected was too 
plain to be misunderstood. The peo¬ 
ple did not vote blindly—^.ey under- 
stod the platform and indorsed it in 
no uncertain terms. If the President 
is seeking immortality he will not get 
it by uniting the North and South at 
the sacrifice of manhood rights. If the 
President would pursue a policy that 
would secure to every American citi¬ 
zen the full enjoyment of his consti¬ 
tutional rights, and let the Philippines 
go, ho would not only immortalize him¬ 
self but would save the shedding of 
rivers of blood and inaugurate a na¬ 
tional career that would add thousands 
of years to the nation’s life.

THE LIBERATOR. 


UNGRATEFUL WRETCH. 

That negro convict that stole $3000 
worth of jewelry from ex-Governor 
Yates of Illinois, after the governor 
had secured his parole and gave him 
employment, is an exception. Ingrati¬ 
tude of this kind is unknown among 
the negroes. He is certainly a nixed 
blood—a case in which the stray blood 
conquered the honest negro blood. The 
white papers have devoted almost as 
much editorial space to him as they 
have to Booker T. Washington. Leav¬ 
ing the colored race, you can find a 
parallel' to this ungrateful scamp at 
’most any old place. 

You bet you can! 


Last year the six-bits push roped a 
small crowd of idlers into the congress 
by promising an office to each, hinting 
that an office in the league would open 
to the holder many opportunities for 
grafting in the city campaign which 
was to follow. As there is no cam¬ 
paign this year the supposition is that 
the attempt to break into the city 


treasury was to get money to defray 
the expense to Pasadena of all who 
look upon excursions and free lunches 
as life’s highest attainment. If the 
push had got the money it would cer¬ 
tainly have had a full house. 


DEATH OF MR. FOSTER JACOBS. 

When, on the 18th, death claimed 
Mr. Foster Jacobs, a brilliant career 
was cut short. He held a position as 
clerk in the city assessor’s office, 
where he was rated among the most 
efficient. He was a native of Natchez, 
Mississippi, and had been a resident 
of this city about two years. His 
ability and exemplary character was 
immediately recognized and put him 
in the line of promotion. In his death 
the race loses a worthy representative 
and the city assessor’s office a val¬ 
uable member of its worthy force. 


Booker Washington would be noth¬ 
ing but an American negro: "I have 
always been proud of my race, and 
I am prouder of it this afternoon 


than ever before. No temptation, 
were it physically possible,^ could 
make me become a Jap, a Chinaman, 
an Englishman, or any one out an 
American negro. I am told by Mr. 
Jerome, the district attorney of your 
city, that the colored people here are 
a most reputable element. I am glad 
to see that this organization has the 
confidence, the sympathy, and the ac¬ 
tive support of the Christian ministry 
of the city.”—To the New York col¬ 
ored Y. M. C. A., May 7th. 


A COLORED BOY ENTERS THE 
CONTEST. 

Jefferson Ammon, a member of our 
race, has entered the Times scholar¬ 
ship contest. He is every way worthy 
of the support of the race, which sup¬ 
port should be loyal and spontaneous. 
Every colored family ought to sub¬ 
scribe for and read the daily Times. 
Those who are already subscribers 
shouffi pay a year in advance, which 
gives 500 points. New subscribers one 
year in advance 1000 points. If we put 
our shoulders to the wheel as we 
should and must, he will get 50,000 to 
100,000 points.
