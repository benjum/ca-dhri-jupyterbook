REV J. D. GORDON’S WANT OF 
CONFIDENCE IN HIS RACE 


Rev. J. D. Gordon’s “Emanci¬ 
pation Day” address fell like a 
wet blanket upon the thoughtful 
members of his audience. To 
them the address was a frigid dis¬ 
appointment. Though “ right about 
faced, it is the same retrogressive 
note that he was so vigorously 
sounding a year ago in his “Back 
to Africa” wail. A year ago he 
was urging the Negroes here to 
pull up stakes and go back to Africa 
With his doleful cry of “no hope, 
no hope in this country for the 
Negro,” he so wrought upon the 
feelings of many of them, that they 
raised a large sum of money and 
sent him to Liberia, Africa, 
in {search of a promised land. At 
that time he proclaimed he had lost 
all faith in the white man’s sense 
of justice and the future for the 
Negro in this country, according 
to his statements held out nothing 
but black despair. Thus, robed in 
mental “sack cloth and ashes” 
he went about refusing to be com¬ 
forted. 

Well, he went to Liberia but 
the visit was so short, that some 
people think that he didn’t pull off 
his hat there. He made 
the trip, well provided with funds 
furnished by laboring colored men 
and women of this community and 
whether his ministerial salary 
went on, while he was enjoying 
life on the “bounding tide” and 
seeing the sights of London and 
Paris we have not been informed. 

On his return his same note of 
distress “no hope, no hope” was the 
major key of his report—his last 
proclamation, being worse than 
the first. When he left for Africa 
he had no faith in the white man— 


when he left Africa he had none 
in the black! 

Sounds a Backward Note 

Your attention, however, is called 
to his Emancipation Day address— 
the part that had such a cooling 
effect upon the ardor of the youth¬ 
ful colored business men. He said, 
among other things, that its a 
mistake for Negroes to take 
their trade to Negro firms as the 
Negroes are unable to carry them 
from one pay day to another. In 
other words, unless the Negro 
business men can open big houses 
like those on Spring and Broadway, 
Negroes should not patronize them. 
That’s about the only construction 
that can be put upon his remarks. 
In the first place his statement that 
Negro business men cannot 
carry their customers from one 
pay day to another is erroneous. 
There are a number of colored 
grocers in the city who are not 
only carrying scores of Negro families 
from one pay day to another, but 
scores of families of other races 
as well. Rev. Gordon’s ignorance 
on this point is doubtless due to 
the fact that he never patronizes 
a negro business establishment. 

While he lives offthe earnings 
of his own race, (Negroes) whom 
he says are not able to carry you 
from one pay day to another, 
what contribution morally or 
otherwise, has he made in aiding 
them to attain the condition of 
which he complains? For instance 
there is a colored tailor making 
suits from $40 up, no Negro tailor 
makes the $40 and $50 suits that 
Rev. Gordon wears, paid for with 
money earned by Negroes. If the 
Negroes should follow Rev. Gordon’s 


advice lie would soon have to quit 
preaclnngto engage in a less lucrative 
vocation. What the Negroes need 
are ministers who lead their flocks 
along the highway of race confi¬ 
dence instead of sounding the note 
of mistrust whenever the Negro 
and his enterprises are mentioned. 
Give to the Negro, minsters who will 
lead him to Negro business estab¬ 
lishments as well as to the church. 
When all Negro pulpits are filled with 
broad minded, big hearted, race 
imbued Christian men, Negro talent 
and Negro enterprises will go for¬ 
ward by leaps and bounds—to 
the condition where complaints 
would not reach. 


BRILLIANT FABEN FHI 
BALL 


The Charity Ball given by the 
Faben Phi Fraternity at Blanchards 
Hall on New Year’s Evening was 
the most brilliant affair ever given 
in our city. The many beautiful 
gowns of the ladies with the con¬ 
trast of the gentlemen in evening 
dress, the ball room beautifully 
decorated, music that more than 
charmed, all assisted to make the 
occasion a most memorable one. 

Old timers in Los Angeles say 
they had never witnessed such a 
brilliant affair. 

Every detail for the comfort of 
the large number of guests had been 
provided for and every one present 
went home delighted and charmed 
with this, the first affair of the 
Fraternity. 

One of the pretty schemes for 
effectiveness was the arrangement 
over the stage of a festoon of elec- 



















TWO 


trie lights set in beautiful colored 
Japanese lanterns that shed a 
delicate ray of light on the Frater¬ 
nities name * Faben Phi, 1912” 
which was suspended on a purple 
screen in gold letters, the Frater¬ 
nities colors. During the dancing 
of a moonlight and Twilight dance 
all the lights in the hall were ex¬ 
tinguished with the exception of 
the ones set in this beautiful festoon, 
which presented a scene that was 
beyond description. Another feat- 
ture before the first numbers on 
the engagement card, was the re¬ 
ception held by the patronesses 
who were seated around a white 
pedestal holding several pots of 
beautiful flowery plants where all 
the guests were ushered after re¬ 
moving their wraps. This was a 
decided success and at once made 
all present feel as one large family. 

Many beautiful gowns, the 
creation of Worth, were worn, 
among them the following gowns 
were noticed: Mrs. Ankrum, 

blue satin with spangles and orna¬ 
ments of diamonds; Miss M. Baker, 
white chiffon over white satin

chard’s Hall. The music by Mc- 
Vey’s full orchestra was of the 
highest order and gave entire satis¬ 
faction. Mac certainly was at his 
best. 

A GREAT DAY AT THE LYCEUM 


The first program for the New 
Year which was rendered last Sun¬ 
day at the Lyceum, was one full 
of inspiration. Those taking part 
in the program were greeted by 
a large and enthusiastic audience. 
“Mv Country ’Tis of Thee,” the 
opening song, was sung with a 
will, and as the melody made by 
those rich, mellow voices rang out 
on the balmy evening air it im¬ 
parted new life and inspiration 
to all present. 

In harmony with the time and 
occasion, the speakers and those 
assisting them brought a message 
of hope and good cheer. 

Mrs. Moore’s paper on what 
the Negro Women had contributed 
to American progress, was one of 


THE LIBERATOR 


great value. Its statistics and re¬ 
cords of deeds of heroism performed 
by colored women in peace and 
war is a valuable .collection that 
required much painstaking research. 
The historical data of the paper is 
well worth the cost of collection. 


A liens worth 

Mrs. Allens worth, one of the 
founders of Allensworth, Califor¬ 
nia, told the audience of Allens¬ 
worth, its aims, its purposes, its 
people, its enterprises and their 
attendant prosperity. It was an 
interesting talk full of hope and 
put that prosperous coming colony 
before the people in a very favor¬ 
able light. 

Besides farming, the colonists 
are engaged in dairying with success. 
Cows are sold on credit to those 
desiring them. The cream from 
the milk is taken in payment 
till they are paid for the purchasers 
having the use of the milk. In 
this way cows pay for themselves 
while furnishing food for the family. 

Allensworth has a population of 
176 persons, a school of 20 pupils, 
one colored teacher, two stores and 
one hotel. Allensworth is on the 
main line of the Sante Fe Railroad 
between Los Angeles and San 
Francisco; has a depot telegraphic 
and telephone communication; has 
a post office and a colored post¬ 
master. The recent completion of 
a large artesian well has settled 
the water question, assuring an 
abundance of water for irrigation. 
The young people’s banking asso¬ 
ciation holds monthly meetings 
at which time all money saved is 
deposited in the bank at Delano. 

The vocal solo by Mrs. Mabel 
G. Walker Davis was warmly ap¬ 
plauded. It was a marked feature 
of the program. The violin solo 
by Miss Besse Williams was so 
well received that she was com¬ 
pelled to reappear in response to 
an encore. Miss Williams is one 
of the most promising young musi¬ 
cians in the city. She spent last 
summer in Colorado where her 
musical talent was greatly admired 
as shown by the numerous calls 
where she appears before large 
audiences.

\\ hy Rev. Gordon shouldgo to Li¬ 
beria to learn that it is no place 
for the American Negro is a mys¬ 
tery. Any member of his church 
who reads the papers could have 
given him that information. 
Another strange thing in this con¬ 
nection is, that in this city with its 
free schools, colleges, public librar¬ 
ies, newspapers, magazines, tele¬ 
graphs and telephones, that enough 
people could be gotten together to 
pay the expenses of such a trip. 
But if you teach the people not to 
read the newspapers, and they 
follow your instruction any man 
can play the role of feudal lord, next 
door to a college. 


MAYOR ALEXANDER AND THE 
AFRO=AMERlCAN COUNCIL 


Mr. James M. Alexander, Presi¬ 
dent of the state Afro-American 
Council, has had himself elected 
president of the local council. This 
result was brought about by his 
announcement that Mayor Alex¬ 
ander had agreed to appoint no 
Negro to a position unless he had 
the endorsement of the Council 
signed by him, James Alexander. 
There were a number of candidates 
for the office but it was argued that 
as the mayor had taken James 
Alexander into his confidence and 
would recognize no applicant for 
a place without his, James Alex¬ 
ander’s endorsement, it would be 
folly to do other than elect Alex¬ 
ander. After a hot fight, Mr. 
Shackleford had to withdraw from 
the race, putting Alexander in 
complete control of the state and 
local council. 

Whether or not the mayor has 
made Mr. James Alexander and the 
council his sole distributor of Negro 
patronage we are not in the posi¬ 
tion to say. But one thing we do 
know, and that is, neither Mr. 
Alexander or the council have 
supported the mayor for office 
of any kind since the Mayor 
left the Republican convention near- 
nearly ten years ago to run inde¬ 
pendently against Mr. Lauder for 
Supervisor. They worked against 
him and when the mayor was 
recall-candidate against Harper, the 
council supported Harper and when 
he withdrew from the race the or¬ 
ganization under the leadership of 
Mr. James Alexander gave its 
support to Wheeler the Socialist 
labor candidate. The council made 
Smith’s fight against the Mayor 
two years ago, and took no part in 
{he bitter campaign last fall. In 
view of these facts well known to all, 
it is somewhat surprising that the 
Mayor would take the leaders of 
the council into his confidence 
knowing as he doubtless does, that 
he was forced to win without them 
in each of his campaigns. 

Politics makes strange bedfellows 
since the Afro-American Council 
is announcing that “all de pie dat 


de culled brudder is to git is to 
be dished out for de mayor by its 
president, Jim Alexander” as the 
Editor heard one of the Council’s 
members state. 


A MAMMOTH EDITION COMING 


The twelfth anniversary edition 
of The Liberator will be published 
April 1st. It will be a mammoth 
edition and will contain hundreds 
of portraits of the leading colored 
men of the state. Ministers, law¬ 
yers, Doctors, Merchants and men 
who are making their marks in 
many callings. In men who have 
done things, California leads the 
Pacific Coast. Cuts of many of 
the splendid homes owned by the 
colored people will also appear. 
Churches, lodges, stores and offices 
of our business and professional 
men and women will testify as to 
the Negro’s splendid achievements 
in this wonderland of the great 
west. How a mere handful of 
colored people in this city grew to 
20,000 in 15 years, accumulating 
millions of wealth will be graphic¬ 
ally told. 

This mammoth edition will be 
mailed to every part of the civi¬ 
lized world and will be a perpetual 
memorial of Negro achievement. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 

Mr. W. J. Bowman is on the sick 
list. His speedy recovery is sin¬ 
cerely hoped for.
