THE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY 

OF THE NEGRO 


The dollar is mighty. It will 
not do everything, but it can cause 
to be done many things. Money 
may be the root of many evils, 
but certainly it is not the root of 
all evil, nor is money itself an evil. 
In the getting of it there is but one 
just limit, and that is, honesty. 
Within the bounds of straight¬ 
forward, downright, old-fashioned 
honesty one may pile his dollars 
as high as lie may. A monetary 
standard should never be absolute, 
but, in spite of ourselves, money 
counts. 

A commercially successful 
people will ultimately command 
and demand political and civil 
recognition. The Jew has suffered 
many racial persecutions and em¬ 
barrassments. He staked his 
amelioration, almost solely, upon 
his commercial opportunity. Often 
the opportunity was almost nil, 
but lie made it anyway. More 
oitJjBffio competition was severe— 
WTeiess he observed the strict- 
es^economy, outwitted and out¬ 
sold his competitors, and, if he 
did not put his competitor out of 
business, he made a place for him¬ 
self. By pulling together racially 
the Jew built his commercial life 
so strong that he has become an 
almost controlling factor in many 
business centers. His pennies 
have become dollars and his dol¬ 
lars are counted by the millions. 
Who has not heard of the despised 
Jew? Who has not heard him 
maligned? Who has not known 
him discriminated against? But 
the Jew disarmed his enemies and 
increased his friends by the path 


of gold. A rather materialistic 
method for political and civil free¬ 
dom, to be sure, but a near-cut 
way no doubt, in a rather materail- 
istic world. 

While the Jew to this day is 
ostracised in many sections and 
snubbed in many social centers— 
the Jew has created social centers 
of his own, and, by forced march, 
he has taken others. 

The Negro’s commercial oppor¬ 
tunity is by far better than the 
Jew’s was at the beginning. In 
the first place the Negro has a 
mighty constituency. There are 
ten million persons of his own race 
to be fed, clothed, doctored, 
drugged, sheltered and buried. At 
the lowest estimate it will take $10 
per month to feed, shelter and 
clothe each person, or one hundred 
and twenty million dollars annually 
for the race. Let us suppose there 
is a profit of 5% net on this volume 
of business; if so, that would yield 
six million dollars annually in 
the hand of the business men who 
controlled Negro trade. This 
would give three thousand Negro 
Merchants a living income of 
$2,000 per year. The Jew had 
to go outside of his race for busi¬ 
ness. He had to over-ride racial 
barriers to succeed commercially. 
The Negro can turn his racial 
disadvantage to advantages. The 
Negro can succeed commercially 
among his own people—he 
the numbers. But more, the Jews 
never were an industrial factor in 
society. They were, and are, too 
few in number to figure in the 
labor market, the agricultural 


field and in the industries. The 
Negro has a monopoly, to a large 
extent on labor. He has physical 
strength and endurance. He has 
numbers to man large jobs. He 
can furnish labor for a Panama 
Canal or a trans-continental rail¬ 
road. Pie is a reliable, tractable 
laborer. This country needs the 
Negro. He is the best common 
labor that the world knows, free 
from strikes and lockouts. This 
country is dependent upon Negro 
labor. This makes the Negro in¬ 
dependent. 

With these points of advantages 
the Negro can enter into the com¬ 
mercial world and succeed, pro¬ 
vided, of course, there is racial 
co-operation. And this there 
should be. Not every Negro will 
stand by Negro enterprises, for 
this would be impracticable and 
inexpedient. Let the Negro take 
advantage of race prejudice and 
complain not. When white clerks 
insult Negro women and will not 
accord them courteous treatment, 
let the Negro simply go ahead 
and build a store o{ his own. 
If a shoe store, owned by a white 
person, will not treat Negroes as 
other patrons are treated, then, 
let a Negro open a shoe store; 
and if all the Negroes buy shoes 
of the Negro merchant someone 
will miss the trade. We might 
carry the illustration into further 
detail, but the point sticks out: 
the Negro has a most inviting 
commercial opportunity. Will he 
see it? If he does, will he seize 
it?

BOOKER T. MAKES PLEA TO 
RACE 


Dr. Washington Urges Negroes to 
Enter Farming and Commercial 
Lines 


(Special to The Advocate) 

Chicago, August 21.—A plea 
to Negroes to cease depending 
on odd and uncertain jobs as a 
means of livelihood and to enter 
farming and commercial lines was 
made tonight ny Dr. Booker T. 
Washington in an address before 
the National Negro Business League 
convention. 

He pointed out that the buyers 
of farm products, household fur¬ 
niture, buggies and wagons, and 
even coffins did not ask whether 
the goods came from the hands of 
a white or colored man. He also 
pointed out that the South and 
West, with their millions of acres 
of unused lands offer welcome to 
the farmer regardless of national¬ 
ity, and said: 

“Now is the time—not in some 
far-off future, but now is the 
time—for us as a race to prove to 
the world that in a state of freedom 
we have the ability and the in¬ 
clination to do our part in owning, 
developing, manufacturing and 
trading in the natural resources 
of our country. If we let these 
golden opportunities slip from us 
in this generation, I fear they will 
never come to us in a like degree 
again. 

“There are more than 270,000,000 
acres of unused and unoccupied 
land in the South and West. 
From ownership of the soil comes 
independence, self-support, happi¬ 
ness, and real manhood rights. 
Land that can be gotten at $10 
an acre now, a few years hence 
cannot be gotten for two and three 
times that much.” 


CORRUPTION IN POLITICS 


One of the reasons assigned for 


the wholesale disfranchisement of 
the Negro was that he corrupted 
the ballot. For this reason he 
was an unworthy and unsafe voter. 
Upon this plea the Negro in the 
South has been disfranchised and 
his disfranchisement has been ac¬ 
quiesced in and condoned in sec¬ 
tions of the country that boast 
of its historic and traditional in¬ 
terest in liberty for every man, 
woman and child. In the mean¬ 
time, those who lifted their hands 
in holy horror against the Negro 
voter and would have none of him, 
seem not to be altogether free from 
the sin which led them to disfran¬ 
chise the Negro. When we were 
approaching constitutional con¬ 
ventions and in the midst of them 
in the South one would have 
thought that the white vote of the 
South, to a man, would be non- 
purchasable, incorruptible and ideal 
in every regard. One needs only, 
however, to read the more recent 
accounts of white primaries to 
note that, although the Negro has 
been barred from politics in the 
South, corruption and buying of 
votes still prevail. What shall we 
say of the white man during a 
recent campaign in the State of 
Mississippi where the highest and 
best were accused not only of 
corrupt political methods, but of 
buying and selling votes, and when 
lying became an everyday charge? 
What shall we say of the recent 
campaign in the State of South 
Carolina where all manner of poli¬ 
tical corruption has been alleged? 
What shall we say of the status in 
the City of New Orleans where, 
at the time of this writing, the full 
force of city police is standing 
ready to quell any riot at the 
ballot box, for it is alleged that 
there may be irregularities and 
other corruption of the ballot? 
The whole story is amusing. It 
has two effects upon the Negro: 
The Negro in the first place laughs 
at this pharasaical boast of the 
white man of his absolute freedom 
from corruptiou. On the other 
hand, the Negro has a feeling of 
resentment because of the hypo¬ 
crisy and downright conceit by 
which he has been politically 


throttled. It was not in The in¬ 
terest of a pure ballot, per se that 
the Negro was disfranchised; it 
was simply a part of the continuous 
and persistent program to keep 
the Negro under. The Negro is 
not altogether a fool. He can see 
these inconsistencies and can punc¬ 
ture the loud boasts and phara¬ 
saical claims of his more favored 
brothers and then deep down in 
his heart the Negro says: “What 
inconsistency!"' But statesman¬ 
ship and government based upon 
such deceit and unholy injustice 
cannot be permanent. The Negro 
knows this. The wheels of the 
gods grind slowly, but they grind, 
nevertheless, and the Negro can 
afford, with prayer and patience, 
to abide his time.

SUPERVISOR McCABE WINS 

Although defeated for nomina¬ 
tion on the Republican ticket, 
he received more votes on the 
Democratic ticket than did the 
Democratic candidate, and, ac¬ 
cording to law, is the nominee 
on that ticket. 

In the coming election Mr. Mc¬ 
Cabe is very sure to get the full 
Democratic vote, the Taft, and 
colored vote, which will insure 
his re-election. 

As a member of the board Mr. 
McCabe stood for an absolute 
square deal on the question of 
the admission of colored girls to 
the nurse training school. He 
urged the admission of all worthy 
applicants without regard to race 
or color. When the polls open 
in November Mr. McCabe will 
receive the votes of every thought¬ 
ful Negro man and woman in his 
district. In questions of public 
policy Mr. McCabe as a member 
of the board stood for a square 
deal for the Negro along with 
other citizens. The Negro asked 
nothing more and should be satis¬ 
fied with nothing less. 

The white citizens of the entire 
city understand fully Mr. McCabe’s 
position and have their eyes upon 
the colored voters of his district 
and will note whether they will 
stand by the man who advocates 
giving them a square deal. The 
Negro can gain no friends by be¬ 
coming an ingrate; and of all the 
sins ingratitude is the meanest. 
The black man who would work 
against the re-election of Mr. Mc¬ 
Cabe is not only a base ingrate to 
McCabe but a traitor to his people 
who would close the door of hope 
to his own women and girls. 

If there is such a Negro among 
us he should be exposed and os¬ 
tracised; for, if one Negro proves 
a traitor, then the whole race is 
looked upon as traitors and will 
be treated accordingly. 

Mr. Colored Voter, you have 
as much at stake as the editor of 
this journal has—whether your 
sons and daughters shall be treated 
as other citizens is in your hands. 
You have one vote, no other 


American citizen has more. With 
his vote, the white mail secures 
protection of the law, position and 
power. If he will, the Negro can 
do the same thing for himself. 
Think it over. 


DR. BOOKER T. WASHING¬ 
TON’S ADVICE 


Elsewhere in this journal we 
publish excerpts from a speech 
delivered by Dr. Booker T. Wash¬ 
ington in which he urged the colored 
people of the Southern and Eastern 
cities to purchase farming lands, 
which are still to be had in large 
quantities. What is good for the 
Negroes in the South and East, 
in this particular, is good for the 
Negroes of this city. Iti the im¬ 
mediate vicinity of this great city 
are thousands of acres of desert 
land that will, in the near future, 
be supplied with water for irriga¬ 
tion which can now be home¬ 
steaded. By making small im¬ 
provements these same lands, when 
under irrigation, will be worth from 
$75 to $200 dollars per acre. 

In the great Coachella Valley, 
just five hour’s ride from the city, 
are thousands of acres of the finest 
farming lands on earth which can 
be purchased on ten year’s time 
at $25 to $100 per acre, 10% cash, 
6% interest. This land produces 
cotton, dates, oranges, grapes and 
every variety of vegetables. The 
farmers of this valley send their 
products to the market 6 weeks 
earlier than from any other sec¬ 
tion, thereby obtaining top prices. 
Crops yield from $50 to $100 per 
acre and even higher. This land 
is sold on terms so reasonable that 
they are within the reach of every 
man and woman who is able to 
work. These rare opportunities 
to purchase farming lands for a 
song, the ownership of which will 
make you independent, will not 
long go begging as they are going 
now. 


GO BACK TO THE PULPIT 


As a politician and office seeker 
the average Los Angeles colored 
preacher makes a mess of it. He 





















THE LIBERATOR 


FIT! 


is usually weak and vacillating, 
readily becoming the tool of cor¬ 
rupt white politicians and the 
companion of the low, vicious, 
disreputable Negro political thug. 
The Negro political thug thinks 
he is doing politics when he is 
betraying his race. Hence the 
Negro political preacher who falls 
into his hands pulls off* deals so 
raw that Judas Iscariot would 
scorn him. For heaven's sake, 
go back to the pulpit, you are not 
bad, you are just too green to 
deal with wily white politicians. 
They use you and then boast of how 
cheapty the “Nigger" preacher can 
be bought.

which this country has ever known in assuring 
big profits on every dollar invested. Subdividing 
land and selling orchards planted from our im¬ 
mense stock of growing olive and orange trees
