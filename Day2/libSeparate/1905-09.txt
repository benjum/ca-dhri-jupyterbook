THE LIBERATOR. 


Rev. Robert J. Burdette 
pays a Tribute to the 
Negro. 

Says the Educated Negro 
Can Do Something Be¬ 
sides Sing. 

THE BAPTIST WORLD CONGRESS. 

Rev. Robert J. Burdette, in his com¬ 
ments on Baptist World Congress, 
while taking exceptions to a colored 
delegate’s reference to the difference 
between the treatment the American 
negro receives at home and that he 
receives in England, the Doctor paid 
the American Negro a splendid tribute. 
If he had called to mind the manner in 
which the colored delegates were treat¬ 
ed who attended the Methodist World 
Conference he'd in this city last year, 
he would perhaps have considered ex- 
c« ptions gi mindless. Although the 
delegates last mentioned constituted a 
body of as distinguished ministers and 
educators as ever visited this city, the 
white hotels would not give them so 
much as a cup ot cold 1 water by way 
of accommodation, for iio other reason 
than that their skins’ were dark. This, 
too, in the city the home of the Doc¬ 
tor’s church—a city that boasts of its 
churches and institutions of learning. 
No one gets more discomfort out of 
the fact that the American Negro gen¬ 
tleman is treated as such, only when 
in foreign lands than he does. After 
paying tribute to Henry Ward Beech¬ 
er’s great work in England in the six¬ 
ties, Rev. Burdette speaks of- the-coK- 
ored man and brother as follows: 

Two Sides of a “Friendship.” 

This, and other scenes of the ’Sixties' 
came back to me very vividly one other 
night, when one of the colored breth¬ 
ren saw fit to praise our cousins of 
England as the people of the land 
where a man was judged by his mind 
and soul rather than by the color of 
his skin. He made his point at the 
expense of his American brethren and 
was rewarded by a triple wave of ap¬ 
plause, hearty and long continued. I 
didn’t object to the colored brother 
expressing his gratitude for welcome 
which the English brethren gave him 
and his. But it did seem to me that 
his gratitude need not have slapped 
at his American brethren. For I, sit¬ 
ting on the platform with him, had 
been a Union soldier. And I remem¬ 
bered very well, that while my com¬ 
rades and myself were willingly and 
gladly risking our lives on Southern 
battlefields that he and his people 
might be free, if the English govern¬ 
ment had had its way at that time,

shall be preserved at all hazards/* 

After reading the statutes relating 
to this matter, His Honor continued: 

“This Court will guard with a jeal- 
ous eye the purity of the ballot box, 
and the Court is assured that the At¬ 
torney^ eneral will do his duty in as* 
sisting the Court in the proper pun¬ 
ishment of all violations of the law in 
this regard; and that the Sheriff and 
his deputies will do their duty in car¬ 
rying out the law in November.” 

The Court pronounced against play¬ 
ing baseball on Sunday, directing the 
Grand Jury to find out whether the 
law was being broktn in this regard, 
and if so to bring offenders to punish¬ 
ment. 

The Commercial-Appeal comments 
editorially in part as follows: 

“This is a healthy utterance. It is 
the most significant that uJdge Moss 
has given expression to in a long time. 
Within the few brief words quoted 
above can be found lurking a deter¬ 
mination that the city of Memphis 
shall be freed from a stigma that has 
clung with uncomfortable closeness to 
the voters who direct the affairs of 
the city. There is a great deal 'in this 
promise of Judge Moss. It has been 
a common saying of late—“what is the 
use of voting, my vote won’t be count* 
eel.” There is the assurance in his in¬ 
structions to Sheriff Monteverde that 
the vote will be. counted, for Sheriff 
Monteverde is as fearless in carrying 
out the instructions of the Criminal 
Court as Judge Moss is in giving them. 

Nothing that has Happened recenii\ 
gives more encouragement to the great 
body of the voting public as yester¬ 
day’s declaration. Memphis is a great 
and growing city, and every man with 
a spark of ambition is working along 
a common way to make it the greatest 
city in the South, but every election 
has added weight. There have been 
assaults at the polls, there have been 
charges and counter charges of steal¬ 
ing ballots, there have been false 
counts and a red record of destroyed 
votes. 

The entire matter has been a stench 
in the nostrils of the community and 
the statement of Judge Moss that he 
will see that there is an honest elec¬ 
tion in November, and his instructions 
to Sheriff Monteverde to take such 
steps as may be necessary to prevent 
fraud, comes as a refreshing breath 
of air. The more conservative citi¬ 
zens had intended to take steps of 
some character to make such a thing 
possible, but Judge Moss, radical and 
severe in this as in other things, has 
taken the initiative. There were those 
yesterday who heard of the charge 
and who shrugged their shoulders with 
that suggestive indication q? doubt, bift 
those close in touch with the court 
said that he was never more in earnest 
and that his word and his instructions 
to the Sheriff were a sufficient guar¬ 
antee that he had passed from beyond 
all clutch or hold of politicians. 

The charge taken literally is the 


most encouraging evidence of a better 
political regime than the people of 
Memphis have yet received. 

He says further: 

Memphis in the past has been a city 
sadly ridden. There are a series of 
smutty pages in the history of the city 
wliich future generations will read 
with regret. Eminent leaders in the 
affairs of the city in times, past have 
promised great things in the way of 
honest elections, but have accom¬ 
plished little, and there is a black stain 
attached to the record of so many past 
elections that it is only with regret 
that the matter is now mentioned.” 

The above from the C. A. must be 
humiliating to its editor. As a citizen 
of Tunica county, Miss., we remem¬ 
ber when that journal made heroes 
of every lyncher and ballot box thief. 
The C. A/s editor labored under the 
delusion that a thief is a respector of 
persons. One set of white men have 
got all the offices and keep them, by 
practicing upon the hungry outs what 
all of them formerly practiced upon 
the negroes. 

The Commercial’s pupils have out¬ 
witted their teacher. 


JEFF DAVIS HOOTED DOWN. 
The Governor of Arkansas Sells a 
Pardon. 

Special to the Commercial Appeal. 

Ozark, Ark., Sept. 19.—The climax 
of tne political battle between Gov. 
Jeff Davis and Attorney-General Rog¬ 
ers was reached here today when the 
two candidates engaged in the most 
bitter and personal debate that has 
marked the compaign up to the present 
time. 

Charges and counter-charges were* 
hurled back and forth, each man ad¬ 
dressing himself directly to the other 
and daring him to deny the accusa¬ 
tions. 

Governor Davis devoted more than 
half an hour to an arraignment of the 
Auorney-General, then announced 
that he would not refer to the latter 
again during the campaign. 

Mr. Rogers declined to be disposed 
of in that manner, however, and an¬ 
nounced that while he had been forced 
into the fight to protect himself, he 
nad only siarted, and intended to pre¬ 
sent proof of his charges against Gov¬ 
ernor Davis. 

The most remarkable demonstration 
occurred during Mr. Rogers’ speech, 
when Governor Davis tried to inter¬ 
rupt him with a question. The crowd 
hooted the governor down, and only 
permitted the governor to proceed at 
Mr. Rogers’ request. Governor Davis 
apparently had a large part of the 
crowd with him while he was speak¬ 
ing, hut the Rogers men came to the 
front later, and when the attorney- 
general had spoken for a short time 
he had aroused the crowd to a high 
pitch of enthusiasm. 

Congressman John S. Little, who is 
a candidate for governor, spoke this 
morning, and Hon. W. F. Kirby, can¬ 


didate for attorney-general, followed. 

In the afternoon Governor Davis and 
General Rogers were the speakers. 
The governor exhibited a note showing 
that General Rogers had borrowed $450 
and that one of the indorsers was M. 
D. L. Cook. The governor endeavored 
to make much capital out of this, and 
said he had ordered the note litho¬ 
graphed, and would distribute 50,000 
copies of it over the state. 

His Life Is Pure. 

“I have no dark chapter in my life 
such as to force me to threaten to kill 
a man who tells it,” declared Governor 
Davis. “Rogers came to my office and 
jumped on my private secretary—a 
cowardly act. He knew that if I had 
been there I would have whipped him 
like a dog. I want to tell him that 
he had better not come to my office. 
Now I dismiss Mr. Rogers.” 

The crowd yelled its appreciation 
when the governor faced the attorney- 
general in a dramatic manner on sev¬ 
eral occasions. 

When the governor concluded there 
were calls for Rogers, and he was 
loudly cheered when he was intro¬ 
duced. Mr. Rogers spoke in a more 
quiet manner than his opponent, but 
at times defied him to deny his accu¬ 
sations. He read a letter from Dave 
Young, a Hot Springs saloonkeeper, 
who declares that Governor Davis 
promised to pardon him of fines- 
amounting to $1600 and costs, but that 
the governor had told him to keep the 
matter off until after the election. 
Young claims that he afterwards gave 
$150 to a party for Davis to pay life 
insurance with. This was 18 months 
ago. Since then, a few weeks ago, 
the money was repaid to him. 

Referring to the charge. Governor 
Davis made against him, General Rog¬ 
ers said: “These charges are false, 
as false as false can be, and the ac¬ 
cuser knows it from the bottom of his 
heart. What does Governor Davis 
know about the penitentiary? He nev¬ 
er attends the board meetings. I 
charge him with violating his oath of 
office when he fails to attend the meet¬ 
ings.” 

General Rogers repeated his Forrest 
City explanation of the Cook note. He 
declared that he had never accepted 
a gift or donation to conduct his cam¬ 
paign. 

It will he remembered that Gover¬ 
nor Davis was expelled from the Bap¬ 
tist church for immorality some years 
ago, but that did not defeat him for 
re-election. The governor and his at¬ 
torney-general are charging each oth¬ 
er with gross breaches of honor. What 
a howl would go up if they were ne¬ 
groes? It would be proof of the ne¬ 
groes’ unfitness for anything but 
slaves.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT? . 

There are scores of colored families 
in this city owning homes represent- 
ign a money value of $1500 to $4000. 
Aside from furnishing them a place 
to eat and sleep, they yield no income 
whatever, the owner being compelled 
each day to seek employment of oth¬ 
ers, leaving his children to the street 
and evil associations that are sure to 
lead to a life of crime. Now if the 
homes in question were turned into 
cash which can be easily done, the 
owners could purchase from three to 
five acres of land just outside the city 
limits on one of the inter-urban car 
lines. With money named, each pur¬ 
chaser could pay cash for his land, 
and build suitable cottages and imme¬ 
diately become self-supporting. Such 
a place devoted to the production of 
vegetables would not only furnish 
pleasant and healthful employment to 
a family of from four to eight persons, 
but furnish the means for properly 
educating the children of such a fam¬ 
ily, with something to spare. The ex¬ 
perience and practical knowledge the 
children would gain by such training 
would be of inestimable value to them 
in after life. If each child is given 
a small piece of land to cultivate, al¬ 
lowing him or her to put the money 


made from sales in the bank to their 
own credit, they would discover in a 
short time that they could employ 
themselves at better wages than any 
one else is willing to give them. The 
lessons thus learned in money-making 
and self-employment would soon lead 
to the combination or capital, the cre¬ 
ating and handling of large business 
enterprises. If our suggestion was 
taken it would only be a short time 
before this property would come into 
the city, realizing for the owners’ small 
fortunes, and the business experience 
gained by the children would enable 
them to profitably handle the fortunes 
that would certainly fall to them. 


TWO noble women gone. 

It is with sincere regret that we 
chronicle the deaths of Mesdames C. 
C. Flint and L. C. Young, which oc¬ 
curred in this city on the 22d and 23d 
respectively. The high standing of 
their husbands as leaders placed them 
in positions where they could and did 
render valuable service in upbuilding 
the race. Than Mrs. Flint no nobler 
woman ever lived. Possessing a sweet 
and retiring disposition, ever ready to 
aid any good cause, she was univer¬ 
sally loved and is sincerely mourned 
by all who had the good fortune to 
know her. 

Two noble women have joined each 
other in the home of the great and 
good. Peace to their asnes. 


A BRUTAL MURDER. 

The killing of Mr, Godfrey on Labor 
day was brutal in the extreme. The 
verdict of the coroner’s jury was the 
strongest inducement to the commis¬ 
sion of more such crimes ever given 
in this section. The charge that God¬ 
frey was drunk cuts no figure what¬ 
ever. He had whipped the man that 
insulted him, and was leaving the 
scene as best he could when knocked 
down and killed by a murderer, with 
whom he had no difficulty. If the kill¬ 
ing of Godfrey was justifiable on the 
ground that he was drunk then any 
murderously inclined person can knock 
down and kill on our streets any drunk 
he meets. Admitting that the fall 
killed him, who caused him to fall? 
The negroes will learn from Godfrey’s 
fate that while they have a perfect 
right to join labor organizations,” the 
safest way to take part in a Labor 
day parade is from a second-story win¬ 
dow. Individually, the men composing 
that jury may be all right, but collect¬ 
ively they are unfit for such service. 


Elsewhere in these columns will be 
found comments by Rev. Robert J. Bur¬ 
dette on the part the Negro played in 
the Baptist World Congress held in 
London, England, during the past sum¬ 
mer. It is needless to state that the 


article will be read with interest. Next 
month we will give the Southern view 
as set forth by Rev. A. W. Bealer of 
Cartersville, Ga. Than he, no baser 
hypocrite ever stood in pulpit. What 
a pity, a great noble soul like Doctor 
Burdette had to associate on terms of 
equality with malevolent little spirits 
line Bealer and Dixon. 


KEEP THE SIDEWALKS CLEAR. 

It seems as if a gang of hoodlums 
insist on making the sidewalks and 
steps of our churches their headquar¬ 
ters for smoking cigarettes and the 
discussion of unclean subjects. It is 
embarrassing for ladies to come to 
church unaccompanied, especially in 
the evening, when they have to push 
their way through a crowd of loud¬ 
mouthed dudes and cigarette fiends 
before they can get into the church. 
If these hoodlums have no more re¬ 
spect for the church tnan to hang 
around their steps and sidewalks dis¬ 
turbing their meetings and annoying 
the pedestrians, the churches out of 
respect for themselves ought to call 
on the police, if necessary, and make 
these future jail birds and convicts 
move on. 


LADIES SHOULD REMOVE THEIR 
HATS. 

The trustees of Wesley Chapel will 
hereafter insist on the ladies remov¬ 
ing their hats during the services. 
This rule should be adopted by all of 
our churches if it has not been already. 
Wearing hats by ladies in public as¬ 
semblies is, in but a few instances, a 
custom of the past, and in those in¬ 
stances where they are worn they are 
certainly annoying and it is nothing 
short of an imposition of which women 
ougnt not knowingly oe guilty. 


The Broadway Department Store’s 
annual fall opening eclipsed all former 
openings. The crowd packed Broadway 
and Fourth almost to suffocation for 
a block away. Taken all in all it sur¬ 
passed anything of the kind ever wit¬ 
nessed in the city.

THE NIAGARA MOVEMENT. 

* s Nia gara Movement? 
I he Niagara Movement is an organiza¬ 
tion composed at present of 54 men 
resident in 18. states of the United 
States.. These men having common 
aspirations have banded themselves 
together into one organization. This 
organization was perfected at a meet¬ 
ing held at Buffalo, N. Y., July 11, 
and 13, 1905, and was called “The 
Niagara Movement.” The present 
membership, which of course we hope 
to enlarge as we find others of like 
thought and ideal, consists of minis¬ 
ters, lawyers, editors, business men 
and teachers. The honor of founding 
the organization belongs to F. L. Mc¬ 
Ghee, who first suggested it; C E 
Bentley, who planned the method of 
organization and W. M. Trotter, who 
put the backbone into the platform. 

The organization is extremely sim¬ 
ple and is designed for effective work. 
Its officers are a general secretary and 
treasurer, a series of state secretaries 
and a number of secretaries of specific 
committees.. Its membership in each 
state constitutes the state organiza¬ 
tion under the state secretary. 

Other persons it seeks to convert io 
its way of thinking; it respects their 
opinion, but believes thoroughly in its 
own. This the world teaches us is 
the way of progress. 

What the Niagara Movement Proposes 
to Do—Platform of Principles. 

What now are the principles upon 
which the membership of the Niagara 
movement are agreed? As set forth 
briefly in the constitution, they are as 
follows: 

(a) Freedom of speech and crit¬ 
icism. 

(by An unfettered and unsubsi¬ 
dized press. 

(c) Manhood suffrage. 

(d) The abolition of all caste dis¬ 
tinctions based simply on race and 
color. 

(e) The recognition of the principle 
of human brotherhood as a practical 
present creed. 

(f) The recognition of the highest 
and best training as the monopoly of 
no class or race. 

(g) A belief in the dignity of labor. 

(h) United effort to realize these 
ideals under wise and courageous lead¬ 
ership. 

All these things we believe are of 
great and instant importance; there 
has been a determined effort in this 
country to stop the free expression of 
opinion among black men; money has 
been and is being distributed in con¬ 
siderable sums to influence the atti¬ 
tude of certain Negro papers; the prin¬ 
ciples of democratic government are 
losing ground, and caste distinctions 
are growing in all directions. Human 
brotherhood is spoken of today with a 
smile and a sneer; effort is being mane 
to curtail the educational opportuni¬ 
ties of.the Colored children; and while 
much is said about money-making, not 
enough is said about efficient, self-sac-

toil of head and hand. Are 
not all these things worth striving for? 
The Niagara Movement proposes to 
gam these ends. All this is very well 
answers the objector, but the ideals 
are impossible of realization. We can 
never gain our freedom in this land. 
To which we reply: We certainly can- 
not unless we try. 

Ceaseless Agitation, Exposure of 
Wrongs Unerring Way to Liberty. 

if we expect to gain our rights by 
neiveless acquiescence in wrong then 
we expect to do what no other nation 
ever did. What must we do then? We 
must complain. Yes, plain, blunt com¬ 
plaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing 
exposure of dishonesty and wrong— 
this is the ancient, unerring way to 
liberty, and we must follow it I 
know the ears of the American people 
have become very sensitive to Negro 
complaints of late and profess to dis¬ 
like whining. Let that worry none. 
NO NATION ON EARTH EVER COM¬ 
PLAINED AND WHINED SO MUCH 
AS THIS NATION HAS, and we pro¬ 
pose to work. These are the things 
that we as black men must try to do: 
Need of Work—Things to be Done. 

To press the matter of stopping the 
curtailment of our political rights. 

To urge negroes to vote intelligently 
and effectively. 

To push the matter of civil rights. 

To organize business co-operation. 

To build school-houses and increase 
the interest in education. 

To open up new avenues of employ¬ 
ment and strengthen our hold of the 
old. 

To distribute tracts and information 
in regard to the laws of health. 

To bring negroes and labor unions 
into mutual understanding. 

To study negro history. 

To increase the circulation of honest, 
unsubsidized newspapers and periodi¬ 
cals. 

To attack crime among us by all civ¬ 
ilized agencies. In fact, to do all in 
our power by word or deed to increase

AN UNKNOWN NEGRO HERO PRE¬ 
VENTS FRIGHTFUL WRECK 
IN MISSISSIPPI. 

WAYNESBORO, Miss., Sept. 19 — 
An unknown negro prevented a fright¬ 
ful wreck on the Mobile and Ohio Rail¬ 
road near here today. The railroad 
telegraph operator at this point re¬ 
ceived orders for fast passenger train. 
No. 4 to meet the south-bound local 
at Boyce, six miles north of Waynes- 
boro. The operator in his hurry forgot 
to deliver the order and the fast train 
went through Boyce like a cannon 
bail. An unknown negro happened to 
be at the turning point of a sharp 
curve and saw both trains approach¬ 
ing each other at the rate of fifty miles 
an hour. Standing in the middle of 
the track, he began signalling both 
trams and the engineers being at¬ 
tracted by his wild gesticulations, ap¬ 
plied the air brakes. Both trains were 
stopped just in the nick of time, the 
engines being only three feet apart 
when they were brought to a stop. 
After saving the two trains the negro 
disappeared in the woods without giv¬ 
ing his name. The railroad operator 
at Waynesboro immediately resigned 
by telegraph. 


The statement of the principles and 
purposes of the Niagara Movement 
must meet the approval of all justice 
and liberty loving citizens irrespective 
of race or color. It will not, o- course, 
have the approval of many Negro of- 
ficeseekers, who would sacrifice their 
race and everything else for office. 
And certain white men whose chief 
desire is to so restrict the Negro’s 
rights as to reduce him to a condition 
worse than slavery, will raise their 
favorite howl about negroes wanting 
social equality. This has usually been 
sufficient to frighten the average white 
man to silence like unto death. This 
old howl about social equality will not 
deter any manly Negro from contend¬ 
ing for the rights guaranteed him by 
the Federal Constitution. The Negro 
is an American citizen and will enjoy 


WESLEY CHAPEL LITERARY 
SOCIETY. 

The literary department of the En- 
wortli League, of which Mr, J. H. 
Stephens is President, held its first 
meeting in the new church on the 19th 
inst. The audience was served with a 
very good programme, which consisted 
of vocal and instrumental selections 
a paper, “The Success of the Negro.'* 
by Miss Moore, and a debate “Re* 
“l™ 1 ' ™at foreI sn immigration 
should be further restricted ” The de¬ 
baters were Mr. Jas. A. Warren and 
Emanuel Hall in the affirmative, and 
Mr. J. H. Stephens and Mrs. W H 
Stoval in the negative. The arguments 
being fair on both sides, the judges 
decided it was a tie. Mr. Jas. A. War- 
ren one of the debators, is a valuable 
addition to our literary and church 
workers He graduated from one of 
our Southern colleges last summer and 
is also a brother to Mr. Elis N War¬ 
ren, who is well known and respected 
in our community.
