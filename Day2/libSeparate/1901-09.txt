The White Press 


Sees the Folly of Encourag¬ 
ing the Mob. 


Have Endangered the Lives 
of White Men. 


Changed Their Tune. 


“Lynch law appears to be on the 
Increase in this country and in the 
negro race. In the southern states we 
recall no recent instance of the lynch- 
majority of cases the victims are of the 
ing of a white man. That such acts 
disgrace our nation and tend to graver 
consequences than many realize is suf¬ 
ficiently evident. In the end society 
will have order, and communities 
which show incapacity to govern them¬ 
selves will he ruled with the strong 
band. Lynching not only disgraces 
the community in which it occurs, but 
tends directly to the increase of 
crime. Especially is this true when 
the executioneers are of one race, and 
the victims are of another. Swift and 
certain punishment under the solemn 
forms of the law is an effective deter¬ 
rent of crime. Death at the hands of a 
mob has the opposite effect. A race 
numbering millions in one country 
cannot be subdued by the fear of 
lynching. They can be, and in the 
South are being, turned into wild 
beasts, reckless of their own lives and 
of the lives of others. The object of 
lawful punishment is repression of 
crime. The object of lynching is wild 
vengeance upon some one assumed to 
be guilty. Every negro in Mississippi 
knows that the three persons who were 
lynched o nThursday at Carrollton 
met their fate, not because they were 


criminals, but because they were ne¬ 
groes. Had they been white they 
would have been duly convicted 
before punishment. We know that 
the low-class negro is prone to 
crimes against women. The planters 
who are said to have been prominent 
in the Carrollton lynching were seek¬ 
ing by terrorism to secure the safety 
of their families. They will never do 
it by such means. On the contrary, 
brutal negroes will be made more dan¬ 
gerous, and those who would* other¬ 
wise be good citizens will be led to 
aid and protect them. In a conflict of 
races the blacks will stand by each 
other, with ever-lessening regard for 
law and justice. * *. * Negro crime 

can never be suppressed by white men 
alone. The respectable negro element 
must be enlisted in the cause. And 
that can never be accomplished while 
negroes are lynched for crimes, for 
which white men would he tried.”— 
S. F. Chronicle. 

--o- 

LYNCHING. 

Some incidents in the recent epi¬ 
demics of lynchings have illustrated 
with extraordinary clearness the fact, 
which was already coming to be un¬ 
derstood, that the cause of lynching is 
not the delay nor the uncertainty of 
legal punishment. The mob at Pierce 
City, Mo., killed two or three innocent 
men and banished a large number of 
others, but has not yet caught the 
guilty man, who will be punished, if 
at all, by the law. It was not the un¬ 
certainty of the law that impelled the 
mob, but its certainty. The law would 
have singled out the guilty wretch 
and punished him, but the mob was 
thirsting for the blood of the innocent, 
and preferred indiscriminate massacre 
to discriminate punishment. Still 
more clear was the case at Asheville, 
Ala. Here the guilty wretch was al¬ 
ready .convicted and sentenced to 
death. The trial had been as summary 
and ruthless as any improvised vigil¬ 
ance committee could have provided. 


The mob, in that case, could have had 
no conceivable motive but contempt or 
defiance of law. If two white men had 
to be killed to stop that mob and save 
for a few days the life of a con¬ 
demned negro, the lesson was all the 
more impressive. The life of the ne¬ 
gro was not worth saving, and was al¬ 
ready forfeited, but the majesty of the 
law was worth saving at any cost.— 
Fresno Republican. 

WHY SO MANY HOMICIDES? 

The columns of the daily press, as 
well as such statistics as have been 
compiled, seem to confirm the asser¬ 
tion that homicides, are increasing in 
this country at a percentage much 
greater than that of the increase in 
population. Tins fact furnishes a sub¬ 
ject for deep study on the part of our 
criminologists. There seems to be no 
apparent reason for such an increase 
in our murder records. While we have 
been insisting, in spite of the reference 
often made to “the good old times,” 
that public morals have not deterior¬ 
ated, but have steadily improved, we 
are confronted by the fact of an in¬ 
crease in the form moral depravity re¬ 
garded as one of the worst known to 
ethics or law. To what can be as¬ 
cribed the cause of this situation? * 

* * It must be apparent to every un¬ 

biased observer that the laxity of the 
law against lynchers in the South lias 
had a considerable influence in pro¬ 
moting homicide there. A very large 
portion of the murders committed in 
the United States during the last five 
years have been the work of mobs. 
These crimes, many of which were ac¬ 
complished by burning the victims at 
the stake, are of the most brutal and 
heartless character imaginable. Such 
scenes, accampanied by the wild ex¬ 
citement which attends them, tend 
greatly to brutalize those who witness 
them, and every failure to punish 
those who are guilty of these crimes 
encourages others to commit similar 
outrages. * * —L. A. Times.

A NATIONAL CALAMITY—THE LES¬ 
SON IT TEACHES. 

To say that President McKinley is 
dead, died at the hands of an assassin, 
is one of the saddest things that we 
were ever called upon to chronicle. 
The heads of an entire nation are 
bowed in sincere and heartfelt grief 
for the untimely taking off of one of 
their noblest sons. A soldier, states¬ 
man, citizen, whose public and private 
life has never been assailed. In life 
he enjoyed the confidence of the entire 
country. His death is a personal loss 
to every true American citizen. It is a 
national calamity. The lesson taught 
the American people is a costly one 
and should not be forgotten. It shows 
the fearful cost of tolerating lawless¬ 
ness under any pretext, whether it be 
the cowardly anarchist, who shoots 
down in cold blood his unsuspecting 
innocent victim, or the brutal, heartless 
mob, which murdered its vicitm merely 
to appease their thirts for human blood. 


It amounts to the same in the end—the 
cheapening of human life, rendering 
the lives of all unsafe. The crazed 
brained anarchist murders his victim, 
believing it his duty and brings upon 
his head the violent hands of the law 
and the hatred of mankind. But the 
mobs roam in thousands, killing and 
burning defenseless citizens without 
fear of punishment, claiming to be 
“our best citizens,” and the fact that 
our lawful authorities take no cogniz¬ 
ance, their murders, heartless and 
brutal as they are, become popular,and 
respect for law ceases to be a duty or 
a virtue. This talk of down with the 
anarchists will not insure the safety of 
the lives of our public men until the 
mob is stamped out also. Let the Amer¬ 
ican people who have always had the 
manhood and patriotism to meet every 
emergency crush this species of an¬ 
archy before it crushes them. The white 
press is already trying to ignore this 
national disgrace, which has been 
largely instrumental in bringing upon 
us our present national calamity. The 
reason is obvious. If the nation is to 
live, mob law mu-st go. 


THE PRESIDENT A VICTIM OF 
THE MOB SPIRIT. 

Since the cold-bloocled shooting of 
our good president by the anarchist 
Czolgosz has aroused the people as 
nothing else could against anarchy and 
anarchists and a demand will be made 
for laws for the suppression of this 
band of cold-blooded murderers of in¬ 
nocent people. When the people set 
to work to rid the country of anarchy 
no species of this dangerous disease 
should be overlooked. The mobs that 
have been murdering and burning 
American citizens without the 
slightest hindrance for the past 
twelve months have done as 
much to bring about the fiend¬ 
ish attempt upon the president’s 
life as the assassin himself by setting 
the law at defiance and bringing our 
civiliaztion into contempt. The an¬ 
archist must go, whether he be a cow¬ 
ardly Czolgosz or a Ben Tilman in the 
federal senate. Upon this subject the 
Times comments strongly as follows: 

“Finally, this desperate action of a 
degraded man should- fill us with a de¬ 
termination to insist more strictly up¬ 


on the enforcement of law and order. 
There has been altogether too much 
laxity in this direction of late. The 
liberty of which we boast is rapidly de¬ 
generating into license. The courts 
are becoming lax in their methods and 
justice too frequently halts, or stum¬ 
bles. Let us have a revulsion of pub¬ 
lic sentiment on this subject. Let a 
strict line be drawn between law¬ 
breaking and law-abiding citizens. Let 
it be clearly realized that, in this 
country, where the people are sover¬ 
eign, there is absolutely no excuse for 
any contempt or defiance of the laws 
that have been made by the people 
themselves.” 


THE NEGRO ALWAYS ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE. 

It is a remarkable coincidence that 
the negro has played a prominent part 
on the side of the government in ev¬ 
ery catastrophe that has befallen it 
since his advent within its bounds. In 
spite of the fact that the country has 
never treated him with the considera¬ 
tion due man; he has defended her 
flag with his life whenever it has been 
assailed, whether by foreign) or do¬ 
mestic foes. In peace, with his mus¬ 
cles, he has added to her wealth and 
material welfare. In war he fought 
her battles, always returning to the 
pursuits of peace, only to be forgotten. 
When President Lincoln was assas¬ 
sinated the entire negro race was 
stricken with grief. The first to at¬ 
tend President Garfield, when he fell 
by the assassin’s bullet was Dr. Pur¬ 
vis, a colored physician. Mr. Halph 
Wamley, colored, was a member of 
the jury that convicted Guiteau, the 
assassin. It was James Parker, col¬ 
ored, who felled Czolgosz after he had 
fired the two fatal shots into the body 
of President McKinley. He had gone 
there to shake the President’s hand, 
just in time to fell his assassin. 
Brethren, let us take courage. God 
brought us to this house of bondage 
in order that we might assist the 
American people in working out the 
great destiny of human freedom that 
has been entrusted to their hands. 
Faith in God, obedience to the laws, 
industry, honesty and frugality will 
bring us into our rightful heritage.

PHENOMENAL PROGRESS OF THE 
NEGRO RACE. 

In Education, Religion and the Ac¬ 
cumulation of Property. 

(Speciall prepared for The Liberator 
by Hon. Cyrus Lindell of Lincoln, 
Neb.) 

At the conclusion of the Civil war 
the negro found himself in a peculiar¬ 
ly awkward position. He found him¬ 
self an unfettered adult with the ex¬ 
perience of a little child, so far as the 
practicable responsibilities of freedom 
were concerned. Almost at the same 
time the duties of citizenship were 
placed upon him by constitutional 
amendment. Such a precipitation of 
august responsibilities upon the re¬ 
cently emancipated slave, formed a nu¬ 
cleus for much adverse comment by 
the many who were then opposed to 
him as a citizen . Indeed, when one 
stops to consider this action from an 
unbiased standpoint, one must admit 
that there was some justifiable argu¬ 
ment advanced by those who opposed 
such hasty action. By this action of 
enfranchising the negro, there were 
some results immediately manifested 
in the days of reconstruction that have 
had a very decided tendency to mili¬ 
tate against us in the south. This, 
however, was far from the intention of 
the good men and women who were in¬ 
strumental in giving the negro his cit¬ 
izenship, for the reason that they had 
in view the restoration to him of as 
much as possible of the good 

things of which he had been so 
long deprived of by slavery, just 
as soon as possible. But there 

were a number of unscrupulous car¬ 
pet-baggers to be considered. These 
men flocked to the south and sought 
to engender a hatred between the two 
races in the south, and by this means 
place themselves in high offices. How 
well they succeeded, history tells. This 
hatred did not confine itself to the 
black and white races of the south, but 
soon found place in the breast of the 
southern white man against the so- 
called “Yankee.” Unscrupulous greed 
was the cause of sowing these seeds of 
discontent where Lhe seeds of harmony 
should have been sown. 

THE NEGRO SOLVES THE PROB¬ 
LEM. 

Amid this jungle of conflicting preju¬ 


dice the negro paused in his phantom¬ 
like chase for political greatness and 
realized that he had yet to fit himself 
for the duties and responsibilities of 
life, and qualify for the eminence of 
American citizenship. The negro real¬ 
ized that he needed education. With 
the realization of this truth he had 
found the key that would unlock the 
door of prejudice and uproot the 
sprouts of hatred that had been 
planted. When in the early ’70s this 
idea of education had become generally 
a set desire, there arose from the hum¬ 
ble log cabins of the American negroes 
such a hustle, and actual activity to 
accomplish their desires for culture as 
have never been put forth by any peo¬ 
ple in the history of the world. They 
were the days of the Freedman’s Bu¬ 
reau, the old blue-back spelling book, 
the spelling match; the days of the 
barefooted oby and girl, with a zeal 
and determination to learn something; 
the days of pine-knots, that furnished 
light for the little groups of poorly 
clad students by night; these were the 
days when God had come to lift and 
guide with His own strong hand a 
much neglected and persecuted people. 
In a short time method and syhtem 
found a place in the conduct of the 
education of the young negro. School 
houses began springing up here and 
there, and the negro took advantage of 
every opportunity that was offered. 
After the common school of the olden 
time came the graded school. Then 
there was a demand for higher educa¬ 
tion, which was met by the erection 
of such schools as Hampton, Fisk and 
Howard universities. Today the ne¬ 
gro is proud of some of the best Nor¬ 
mal schools and colleges in America. 
He has twenty-seven thousand school 
teachers, one thousand lawyers, two 
thousand physicians, and a host of 
educated men and women fitted for 
other spheres in life. 

CHURCH WORK. 

Nature has been generous in dealing 
with the negro from the standpoint of 
piety. He has ever been religiously in¬ 
clined and faithful to his church. 
What he has done in the line of church 
work is the result of persistent and 
concentrated effort. His success in this 
is but a sample of what he can do 
along other lines . Today, out of elev¬ 
en million negroes, three million are 


church members. The following is a 
statement of money handled by him in 
his church work for the past thirty 
years: 

Church property owned by 

negroes in the U. S.$26,600,000 

Salaries paid preachers from 

1870 to 1880 .$22,500,000 

Salaries paid preachers from 

1880 to 1890 . 45,000,000 

Salaries paid preachers from 

1890 to 1901 . 66,000,000 

Maintenance of organiza¬ 
tions . 16,000,000 

Home and foreign missions. 3,000,000 


Total ..$179,100,000 

That is a large amount of money. 
With such a sum of money one could 
construct a railroad from ocean to 
ocean, three thousand miles, at a cost 
of $59,700 per mile. It is to be hoped 
chat the negro will get a sufficient re¬ 
turn for this monster investment. It 
is not out of place however, to suggest 
that the trend Ox the negro pulpit must 
be toward the proper educational quali¬ 
fications. Ignorance must leave the 
negro’s pulpit. You are seen by the 
entire country through your churches; 
then your churches must be intelligent¬ 
ly conducted. 

TAXPAYERS. 

With but thirty-eight years of free¬ 
dom, the negro, today, pays taxes on 
$325,000,000 worth of real estate. Slow¬ 
ly but surely, step by step, he is be¬ 
ginning to take his place among the 
citizens of the country. This be¬ 
ginning makes for him a per capita of 
$29.50 in real estate for every black 
ma^n, woman and child in the United 
States. He spends millions of dollars 
foolishly every year, but experience 
will soon overcome that. The negro 
is a success as a citizen, the race has 
progressed with more rapidity than 
any other race under like circumstances 
has ever advanced in the history of the 
world. The young negro of today 
should start in life with a fixed' pur¬ 
pose to succeed in some line. Let all 
unite to build up our race and thereby 
complete the link that will unite all 
in the great brotherhood of man. 

Yours for success, 

CYRUS LINDELL.

The Afro-American Con¬ 
gress Elects its Officers. 

An Aggravated Aggrega¬ 
tion of Political High¬ 
waymen. 

The work d-one by the late Afro- 
American Congress has not tended to 
increase the confidence of the Afro- 
Americans in the so-called league. As 
a race organization it has secured for 
its members no privileges or advant¬ 
ages that they did not enjoy before. In 
shaping the financial and political fu¬ 
ture of the race it has had no influence 
whatever. In this city, to be a mem¬ 
ber -of the league is regarded as a 
detriment and no colored man who 
wants a job of cleaning spittoons will 
jeopardize his chances by admitting 
that he is a member of the Afro- 
American League. The league’s en¬ 
dorsement for a position debars the 
unfortunate applicants’ petition from 
any consideration whatever. This is 
due to no defect in the organization, 
but to the fact that it has been used 
merely for the benefit of its officers, 
especially the officers of the local 
league, who are generally men in 
whom respectable people have no con¬ 
fidence. As a result colored men who 
had the interest of the race at heart 
would have nothing to do with it. A 
perusal of the following list of offi¬ 
cers recently elected will lend no in¬ 
spiration to those interested in the ad¬ 
vancement of race in this end of the 
state: President, T. b. Morton. San 

Francisco; first vice-president, S. B. 
Carr, Pasadena; second vice-president, 
George Russell, Bakersfield; secretary, 
James Alexander, Los Angeles; assist¬ 
ant secretary, F. W. Moore, Alameda; 
treasurer, William Oakman, Pasadena; 
state organizer, J. J. Neimore, Los An¬ 
geles; chaplain, Rev. S. W. Hawkins, 
Los Angeles. The new directorate 
consist of Geo. M. Warner, Los Ange¬ 
les; William Prince, Pasadena; C. 
C. Flint, Los Angeles; Rev. D.R. Jones, 
Los Angeles; William Pickney,Bakers¬ 
field; Norman Williams, Riverside; 
Ed Jones, Fresno; Dudley Sebree, 
Stockton; G. W. Wilson, Marysville; 
J. C. River, San Francisco; C. H. Over- 
ton, San Jose. 


There are a number of good men 
among the above list of officers, but 
they are simply to be used to give the 
thing a look of respectability. The 
above list of officers taken as a whole 
as an aggravated aggregation of politi¬ 
cal highwaymen,among whom are men 
who have no regard for the truth, 
chronic deadbeats, men who do not 
support their families, leaders whose 
only pursuit is idleness, who set no 
examples, have nothing to give but 
advice, who have not the manhood to 
face an honest day’s labor; this, with 
a so-called sin killer, is the gang who* 
is to do politics for what there is in it 
and this in the name of the Afro- 
Americans of this state. The Libera¬ 
tor will camp on the trail of these six- 
bit “cusses,” and don’t you forget it.

PLAYING TO THE GALLERY. 

During Monday’s session of the Afro- 
American Congress a resolution was 
offered endorsing a Mr. Davis of San 
Francisco for a place in the commis¬ 
sary department. Before the vote was 
taken some old gentleman asked 
whether the applicant was a republi¬ 
can. Mr. Morton, to whom the ques¬ 
tion was addressed, replied, “that the 
fact that he had- endorsed him was the 
best proof of his (Davis’) republican¬ 
ism, as he (Morton) would recom¬ 
mend no negro for office but a republi¬ 
can.” This cheap appeal to the preju¬ 
dice of flie ignoramuses of the race 
called forth much unfavorable com¬ 
ment among the intelligent members 
of the audience as to his fitness for 
leadership. His friends sought to 
straighten up the matter by stating 
that Morton didn’t mean what he said, 
but was merely playing to the gal¬ 
leries. Now, if Mr. Morton meant what 
he said, he is too narrow and small to 
lead a people who are rapidly growing 
in intelligence and wealth as the ne¬ 
groes are doing in this state. If he 
did not mean what he said, and has a 
habit of saying one thing and mean¬ 
ing another, his audience will be at a 
loss to know when he means what he 
says—a funny position for a leader. 
Playing to the galleries is the main 
chance of the demagogue. The day 
has passed when a difference of opin¬ 
ion made negro enemies, especially in 
Southern California. The intelligent, 


progressive negroes of this section 
make integrity, fitness and personal 
worth the only requisite for the en¬ 
joyment of their confidence. We en¬ 
tertain no personal feeling against Mr. 
Morton, but simply take issue with his 
public utterance at a meeting said to 
be held in the interest of race advance¬ 
ment.

Elsewhere in this edition we are 
pleased to present to our readers a 
splendid cut of Dr. M. E. Sykes, one 
of the leading physicians in this city. 
By a thorough knowledge of his pro- 
fession and a close attention to his 
business, he has built up an enormous 
practice, which is by no means con¬ 
fined to one race, but to the public 
generally. His successful manner of 
treating diseases has made him so well 
and favorably known that he needs no 
extended mention at our hands, but we 
speak of him rather to show that there 
is room at the top.

A PENNY SUBSCRIPTION. 

There is a very worthy movement on 
foot to raise a penny subscription by 
the colored people of the United States 
for the benefit of Mrs. Ruth Brown 
Thompson and her faithful husband, 
Mr. Henry Thompson. Mrs. Thompson 
is the daughter of John Brown,the libe- 
erator, and is now 72 years old. Mr. 
Thompson is 79. Mrs. Thompson’s 
health has been so feeble during the 
past few years that the presence of her 
devoted husband is continually re¬ 
quired by her side. Their only means 
of support is a faithful daughter,whose 
entire salary as teacher has been spent 


MRS. RUTH BROWN THOMPSON 
REMEMBERED. 

Mr. T. B. Morton of San Francisco 
was one of the many distinguished 
visitors who made the pilgrimage to 
the home of Mrs. Ruth Brown Thomp¬ 
son, daughter of John Brown, the lib¬ 
erator, during the present summer. He 


to relieve their wants. Even this has 
been found insufficient to meet the 
many and urgent demands upon it. To 
meet some cf these demands their home 
was mortgaged, and came very near 
being sold from under them, but was 
saved by the timely aid of friends. We 
called upon Mr. and Mrs. Thompson on 
the 9th inst., and found Mrs. Thompson 
much improved in health and spirits, 
but they are hard pressed. The colored 
people of this state ought to raise $200 
in the next thirty days for these dear 
old people. We should not let them 
want for anything. Let each one who 
reads this send a dollar for them to 
Hon. W. S. Melick, Pasadena, Cal. 


presented her with a valuable memento 
in the shape of a nugget of gold. The 
dear old lady has not words to express 
her appreciation of this token of re¬ 
membrance. Mr. Morton rendered very 
material assistance in lifting the mort¬ 
gages off the Thompson home by rais¬ 
ing $33.48 among friends in San Fran¬ 
cisco.

Emancipation Proclamation 

The 22d of this month is the thirty- 
ninth anniversary of the issuing ol 
the proclamation of emancipation by 
President Lincoln. At the time it was 
issued the country was in the throes 
of civil war. It was undergoing a fear¬ 
ful scourge for its innumanity t-o man, 
in allowing the African to be held and 
sold as a chattel. It was the aim of 
the administration to save the country 
with slavery or put down the war 
without reference to its abolition, but 
the hand of God in the struggle was 
seen, and after two years of disas¬ 
trous fighting and a fearful loss of 
life and property with the chances of 
success evenly divided between the 
combatants, it became apparent to all 
that the country could not be saved 
unless slavery was abolished. Accord¬ 
ingly, President Lincoln framed the 
great document that gave Freedom to 
four million slaves, saved the country 
and made him immortal. Immediately 
after the promulgation of that great 
document the cause of the Union re¬ 
ceived a new impetus and the tide of 
battle set in against the Confederacy, 


with Appomatox as its climax. The 
progress made by the country in every 
avenue of human achievements, since 
the emancipation, has given ample 
proof that freedom is the best and hap¬ 
piest condition of a country, and best 
stimulates the productive qualities of 
its citizens. The advancement made 
by the emancipated slaves has been 
phenomenal and has already repaid the 
country a thousand times over for its 
sacrifice in securing their freedom. 
While it is true, there are disturbances 
here and there, caused by the hatred 
engendered by slavery, the general ten¬ 
dency of the country is toward a larger 
freedom and a kindlier feeling between 
man and man. 


THE NEGRO IS COMING. 

In spite of the bitter persecution to 
which the American negro is subjected 
he is coming, coming all along the 
line. Every year adds to his real es¬ 
tate holdings. He has fourteen bank¬ 
ing establishments, thousands of stores 
and he is to be met with in every ave¬ 
nue of industry that white people will 


allow him to enter. In every avenue 
he enters, if left alone or if no force 
is used against him, he makes a suc¬ 
cess. His haimy, contented disposi- 
iton bears him up in adversity and in 
prosperity he harbors no revenge. He 
is always praying to go to heaven,but 
will commit no rash act to get there, 
therefore, he never commits suicide. 
He rarely ever tackles such high-toned 
diseases as consumption. He shows a 
strong tendency to avoid the charitable 
institutions of the country. Although 
drunkenness and crime are on the in¬ 
crease in this country, they are on the 
decrease among the negroes. His birth 
rate is so much in excess of his death 
rate that the mobs are trying to help 
out the death rate. 'He generally 

avoids divorce courts. He can live on 
50 cents a day and buy a home. He 
never strikes except with his. bread¬ 
winning implements. His country will 
yet be proud of him. 

-p- 

When a woman reads a paper and 
exlaims, “that’s a lie,” something has 
been said. 

—-o- — - 

While the law sleeps, mob law in¬ 
creases. For every negro lynched a 
white man klls a white woman.

AFTER BEN TILMAN. 

The negro press and leaders have 
been very severe in their criticism of 
Mr. Tillman, the mob leader, who is 
making a tour of the country sowing 
the seeds of murder and anarchy. 
When we take into consideration Mr. 
Tillman's environments he needs our 
charity rather than our criticism. Had 
he been born in Massachusetts or 
Maine he might have been a Philips 
or Garrison. It is certain that he 
would not be traveling over the coun¬ 
try advocating the' right of the strong 
to murder and rob the weak. He is a 
victim of circumstances—the legitimate 
offspring of slavery and its brut¬ 
al teaching . Being the product of the 
poor white trash of the South and be¬ 
ing far removed from the elegant of his 
race, his early training was such as did 
not develop the noble qualities inher¬ 
ent in the human family, but rather 
baser ones. He is a living, active em- 
bodyment of slavery's vicious teaching 
and proves again that it not only cursed 
both master and slave but the poor 
whites even worse, for its degredation 
fell heaviest upon the latter, filling 
their bosoms with undying hatred for 
the black race, which have fallen com¬ 
pletely into the hands of this class of 
whites since the emancipation. The re¬ 
sults of the war and the advancement 
made by the negroes since their eman¬ 
cipation has simply increased the hat¬ 
red of the: Tilman element which is 
now in the ascendency in the South, 
with emissaries traveling overtheNorth 
preaching the gospel of murder, hate, 
anarchy and robbery. Some time ago 
one Polk Miller a member of the same 
dangerous band of cold blooded mur¬ 
derers made a speech before the Chau¬ 
tauqua at Long Beach in which he not 
only indorsed lynching with its cold 
murder of defenseless women and its 
burning at the stake features, but he 
even charged Mrs. Harriet Beecher 
Stowe with falsehood, because she con¬ 
tributed so much to the overthrow of 
human slavery a system that for cen¬ 
turies made the women of a whole race 
the, ^victims of the unbridled lust of 
the men of another race. When we be¬ 
held an audience of Christian workers 
as they silently listened to Miller 
preach the gospel of murder and hate 
upon a platform erected- by them for 
the purpose of proclaiming the gospel 


of peace, and beheld still another au¬ 
dience going wild with applause at the 
announcement of Ben Tilman that he 
and his gang of law breakers have de¬ 
cided to set the constitution and 
laws of the country at defiance and 
commit murder and robbery at will, 
we concluded that if we entertained 
contempt for anybody in this connec¬ 
tion it is not for Tilman or Miller.

A MOTHER’S AWFUL NIGHT. 

The murder of Mrs.' Betsie McCray, 
her daughter and son by a blood¬ 
thirsty mob composed of 500 white 
men at Carrollton, Mississippi, on the 
night of the 3rd of August was one of 
the most heartless, uncalled for mur¬ 
ders in the annals of the South’s 
bloody deeds. The boxers were never 
guilty of a fouler deed. For brutal 
heartlessness the actions of that mob 
ofk brave (?) white men, the proud 
defenders of female virtue (?) can be 
pitted against the most fiendish crimes 
known to savegry. Mrs. McCray was 
an industrious, well behaved colored 
woman and she and family enjoyed 
the confidence of all who knew them. 
This being the testimony of the white 
citizens of Carrollton. Every scrap of 
evidence secured tended to establish 
the innocence of the ace—sd. Young 
Taliaferro, son of the murdered peo¬ 
ple, declared the prisoners innocent 
and pled for their lives, but the mob 
thirsted for negro blood and the fact 
that the prisoners were defenseless 
women aroused no sympathy for them. 
To secure a confession the prisoners 
were inhumanly tortured. The mother 
seemed insensible to torture, and ,with 
a devotion possessed only by a 
mother, prayed for the repose of her 
dear children's souls until she was 
swung into the air. The mob wanted a 
confession; it would satisfy the Amer¬ 
ican people and justify their crime. 
From being drawn up and down by 
ropes the neck and wrists of the girl 
presented the appearance of a piece 
of bloody beef, but she made no con¬ 
fession, having none to make. The re¬ 
port sent out that she confessed was 
the same old thread-bare lie always 
sent to the country. Southern mobs 
believe in confessions and usually 
torture one from their prisoner, 
whether guilty or not. Go it, gentle¬ 
men. You are sowing to the wind only 
to reap the whirlwind.

Fiends at Work. 


Kenyon Warren Hubert F. Ives

Ward <5t Bailey 


In the past thirty days five colored 
men have been burned by mobs 
in the South. Four were burned 

at the stake with all of the 

fiendish brutality characteristic of 
Southern mobs. Peter Hampton an 
aged colored man at Pierce City, Mo., 
charged with no crime was burned to 
death in his own home by a mob of 
1,000 white men armed with rifles, who 
surrounded his house, set fire to it arid 
cremated him. The other four victims 
were slowly burned, everything being 
done that was possible to prolong their 
lives and suffering. The torture of and 
burning of Abe Wilder at Nelson ranch 
near Red Ranche, Texas, was the most 
shocking ever witnessed. The details 
of that grewsome atrocity will never 
be known. It is best. Civilized minds 
could not stand it. Six thousand white 
men, women and children turned out 
on Sunday, August 25th, to see a negro 
man burned at the stake. It was a 
great treat to them. Churches and Sun¬ 
day schools were abandoned and 
preachers and church members, teach¬ 
ers and pupils rushed pell mell to take 
part in the barbecue. According to the 
methods pursued in civilized communi¬ 
ties neither of these victims are guilty, 
as neither of them had a trial and 
therefore have not been proven guilty. 
The reports of confessions and proof 
gathered by mobs, bent on violating 
the law is not worthy of the consider¬ 
ation of honest men . Men who will 
burn a human being at the stake will 
lie. Dear reader, would you not 
hate to have a man or woman 
live near you who had taken part 
in burning a human being at the 
stake? Could you trust such a wretch 
with your children? No language can 
describe the low fiendish brutality of 
such human brutes.

DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT. 

In the north, when a white man gets 
tired of seeing his wife live he kills 
her, then commits suicide or tries to 
escape the gallows via the accident or 
insane route. In the south, he sends 
his negro man to a distant part of his 
farm, murders his own wife, takes an 
hour or more’s ride among his neigh¬ 
bors. On his return, he finds her dead, 
as he left her. He calls his hired man 
up and accuses him of the crime, gives 
him a chance to escape, then gives 
the alarm, knowing well that there 
will be no. investigation. Bloodhounds 
soon run the negro to the earth, the 
mob which never fails to get a confes¬ 
sion when one is needed, burns the 
negro at the stake with indscribable 
torture. Justice is satisfied, and the 
matter is dropped. In the north all 
white women that are murdered are 
murdered by white men; in the south 
they are murdered by negroes, who 
murder them just to get burned at the 
stake. Isn’t strange? In the north 99 
per cent of the crimes are committed 
by white men, in the south all of the 
crimes are committed by negroes. 
Strange things, some negroes are. 


The toleration of the mob by the 
federal government has made the white 
American citizen so lawless that our 
great good president, the head of the 
greatest nation on earth cannot shake 
hands with the people without being 
shot like a dog. 

-o- 

Anarchy must be stamped out. The 
most dangerous Anarchy that confronts 
the nation today is the mob. The laws 
will have to be enforced without fear 
or favor, or no life will be safe. When 
we set to work to banish, or hang An¬ 
archists Ben Tilman should head the 
list. 

-n- 

The attempt to place the blame for 
the cold blooded shooting of the Pres¬ 
ident upon Mr. Hearst, is in our judg¬ 
ment cowardly. The mob spirit has 
been encouraged by the entire white 
press of America. Read the head lines 
describing mob murders and see for 
yourself. We have said all along that 
it would lead to a national calamity.

“MADE THIS WORLD TOO HOT FOR 
HIM.” 

Was the shameless manner in which 
the Los Angeles Times called attention 
to the burning of an American citizen 
at the stake by a Tennesee mob a short 
time ago. In the presence of six thous¬ 
and men, women and children the vic¬ 
tim passed through the fiery ordeal 
without uttering a cry. The above 
headline is only a sample of mob en¬ 
dorsement that culminated in the das¬ 
tardly shooting of our great President.

ARCHISTS.

plauded Ben Tillman, when he de¬

most contemptible band of Anarchists 
that ever contaminated our free air

WESLEY CHAPEL, M. E. CHURCH 
NOTES. 

The spontaneous concert and enter¬ 
tainment given last Friday evening, 
September 13, under the management 
of Mrs. C. W. Holden, Mrs. F. L. Don- 
ohoo and Miss L. J. Holden, was a fine 
affair and a success financially. Net 
proceeds $31.46, which was turned over 
to the Steward’s Fund. 

Sunday, the 15th inst., was a sad 
day on account of the great sorrow 
caused by the assassin’s hellish deed. 

At 11 a. m. the pastor, Rev. Dono- 
hoo, took for his subject “Our Dead 
President, William McKinley;” his 
theme, “A Great Man Has Fallen.” His 
text was, “Know ye not that there is a 
prince and a great man fallen this day 
in Israel?” 2 Sam. 3:38. Rev. Donohoo 
spoke from his heart, setting forth in 
glowng terms the greatness of Presi¬ 
dent McKinley. He first showed that 
men were not born great,but they made 
their own greatness. And that McKin¬ 
ley was great in all that goes to make 
up moral and spiritual character. He 
was great intellectually. He was a 
great statesman and he was a great 
husband. Then he handled, “He Has 
Fallen,” which was indeed touching to 
every heart. In closing he showed how 
we may, and urged upon each one, to 
become great in their own sphere of 
opportunities. It was a powerful ser¬ 
mon and the large audience who heard 
it will not soon forget it. 

In the evening a memorial service 
was held and the following program 
was rendered: Song, “That Beautiful 
Land;” invocation, Mr. Wm. Liester;. 
song, “America.” President McKin¬ 
ley’s Boyhood and Military Record,Mrs. 
E. Tibbett; President McKinley in 
Marriage and as Devoted Husband, 
Mrs. E. G. Hill..; song, “Star-Spangled 
Banner;” President McKinley’s Politi¬ 
cal Career, Mr. F. R. Rogers; McKin¬ 
ley as President, pastor; solo, “I Sur¬ 
render All,” Miss Maggie McCray; as¬ 
sassination and Death of President Mc¬ 
Kinley, Mrs. F. L. Donohoo; solo, 
“Nearer, My God, to Thee,” Miss Cath- 
rine Wites; Miss Lennie Hardwell sung 
“We Shall Part, But Not Forever.” 
Prayer by the pastor. Mr. Frank Wiley 
presided. The service was impressive 
throughout. The edifice was filled to 
overflowing. One young man joined the 
church. Collection $20. 


Mrs. Bowden has organized a literary 
and social club for the elevation of the 
young people. The club has an excel¬ 
lent membership of young people, and 
is to meet once a month at the homes 
of different members. Its principal of¬ 
ficers are Mrs, Bowden, superintend¬ 
ent; Miss Rosa McGowan, president; 
Miss Vada Watson, secretary. 


Pasadena entertained the Odd Fel¬ 
lows’ convention. 

~The reception and collation tendered 
the Odd Fellows by the Pasadena lodge 
was the most brilliant affair of the 
kind ever given in that city. It was a 
credit to all concerned.

ON WITH THE SCRAP. 

There is an “awful” scrap going on 
between the Western Outlook and J. 
J. Neimore. If what the Outlook says 
of Neimore is true he is indeed a 
honey. If all reports are true how the 
Eagle man can get through the towns 
between here and Sacramento with 
a whole skin when he goes up there to 
finish his little job is a mystery. A 
colored gentleman supposed\ to be 
Neimore was roughly handled at Bak¬ 
ersfield a short time ago. 


The Rev. C. H. Anderson of Pennsyl¬ 
vania Avenue recently purchased of 
Williamson Brothers a magnificent 
Shonlnger piano of which the family 
is very proud. For fair and square 
dealing and first-class goods we heart¬ 
ily recommend Williamson Bros, to our 
friends and patrons.

vidual owners who have put up cash

BOB COULDN’T GET LODGING. 

There is a rumor going the rounds 
that the devil refused Bob Ingersoll 
lodging when he reached that winter 
resort, stating that all of his best 
heated rooms had been let to distin¬ 
guished church members up in the 
United States. From the actions of 
those American church members in 
London, who left a big hotel because 
their colored brethren were entertained 
his satanic majesty will have to in¬

NORTHERN NEGRO OUTRAGES. 

A suburb of staid old Philadelphia 
furnishes the latest example of mob 
violence against negroes. The account 
reads almost like a repetition of the 
news of similar outrages in northern 
states that have been reported recently. 
In the case of South Camden a negro 
was arrested for an offense, the nature 
of which is not stated in the dispatch, 
and a vengeful mob soon collected. At¬ 
tacks were made indiscriminately on 
the homes of negroes, and many might 
have been killed but for the time’y ar¬ 
rival of a strong police force. 

These recent manifestations of hatred 
toward the negroes in northern com¬ 
munities are difficult to understand. 
There is no rational justification for it. 
The negroes are naturally the most 
peaceful element of the population, 
and there is no reasonable incentive 
for such hostility against them as has 
recently been reported. The only solu¬ 
tion of the mystery seems to be a 
nortward spread of the intense anti¬ 
pathy that has developed in the south 
within the last few years. It seems 
improbable that northern people of 
average intelligence should be influ¬ 
enced by southern matred. * * —L.

LYNCHER PUNISHED. 

Member of Alabama Mob is Sentenced 
to Life Imprisonment. 

WETUMPKA, Ala., Aug. 28.—Geo. 
Howard was today convicted of mur¬ 
der in the first degree and sentenced 
to life imprisonment. Howard was a 
member of the mob which lynched 
Robert White, a negro, in this county 
some months ago. 

Howard is one of the most prominent 
farmers in this part of the country. 
White, who was accused of shoting at 
a white man, was taken from the offi¬ 
cers who had him in custody and was 
hanged. 

-o- 

Colored men, let us unite in an effort 
to smash all dives owned by negroes 
and encourage our young men to seek 
honorable employment. This is the 
only way to win the confidence of re¬ 
spectable people. 


Elsewhere will be found the card ot 
Osburn and BIackstone,the well known 
Pasadena shoe men. This is a reliable 
firm, noted for their fair dealing, and 
sell nothing but first-class shoes. Our 
Pasadena readers will do themselves a 
favor as well as us to give this firm a 
trial. 

—-o- 

The only thing that we are proud 
of in connection with the fact that 
we were born in the South is that we 
left it. It is indeed hard for anyone 
with a spark of human feeling in his 
bosom to find anything in a sec¬ 
tion in which to take pride where 
defenseless women are hanged on the 
public road and their bodies riddled 
with bullets for no other reason than 
that they are black. Why has South¬ 
ern chivelry fallen fr«m its high place 
into the valley of degradation and 
barbarism? Where, oh, where have 
all of the brave white men of the 
South gone? 


The refusal to allow negroes to en¬ 
list in the First Cuban artillery shows 
that the hellish American color preju¬ 
dice is paving the way for trouble in 
Cuba. The United States is the small¬ 
est great country on earth, when the 
question of color is being considered. 
Gentlemen, the negro is here, and you 
are going to complete the work of ab¬ 
sorbing him that you enjoyed so well 
when he was a slave.

THE ODD FELLOWS HOLD A 
SUCCESSFUL CONVENTION. 

The Odd Fellows’ convention was a 
successful one, every section of the 
state being represented. The reports 
of the various departments of the order 
showed a healthy growth, and the fu¬ 
ture of the order looks bright. The 
entertainment at Elks’ Hall was a 
success in every particular. The pro¬ 
gram was especially interesting and 
elicited much favorable comment. 
Among the excellent pieces rendered 
was one by Mrs. G. M. Warner. Mr. 
J. Thomas Norris, one of the popular 
young men, was made one of the grand 
officers for the ensuing year.

White Ministers after Mob. 

Waited Too Long. 

“It is nearly time that men should 
comprehend that human welfare is 
never advanced by methods of lawless 
violence. 

* * * 

.“Vain is the attempt to suppress 
crime or to secure better conditions in 
society through the ferocities of lynch 
law. Every act of mob violence is a 
lapse tpward barbarism. 

“Every one of the recent mobs, 
whether in the South or North, and 
whatever the ground of the hate which 
may have been behind them, helped to 
make possible the crime committed on 
last Friday in Buffalo. 

“And whoever works corruption in 
public office, corporation or institution, 
or overrides law, promotes anarchy. 

“There must be a high reign of law 
or a low reign of lawlessness. Law 
must be made honorable by honorable 
administration of law.” 

WARREN F. DAY, D. D., 

Senior pastor of the First Congrega¬ 
tional Church, 

“We must stamp out these condi¬ 
tions which breed anarchy as merci¬ 
lessly as we stamp out the conditions 
which create the plague, the smallpox 
and the yellow-fever. 

“Lack of proper respect for the law 
and constituted authority is one of the 
curses of our country and we see ‘It 
permeating every fiber of society. Law¬ 
lessness is not the stock-in-trade of the 
anarchist only. Anarchism is only the 


worst and fiercest manifestation of it.”

How the President was Shot 

“I was in the line waiting to shake 
hands with the President. 

“This fellow (Czolgosz), when I left 
the door, crowded in front of me. I was 
next to a little girl, 12 years old, and 
wanted to keep there, but he kept along 
beside me, and crowded in. I tried to 
keep him out, but at last I said, ‘You 

--, go on then.’ 

“The President shook hands with the 
little girl, and then reached out his hand 
to this fellow. 

“Bang, bang! went a revolver, which 
the fellow had in his right hand near his 
waist. He had his hat in his left hand. 

‘ When I heard the shots I grabbed him 
eo ”_throwing his forearm around the 
neck of the reporter fiom behind by way 
of illustration, and causing the subject 
of his illustration to experience strangu¬ 
lation. “ ‘You son-! You’ve shot 

the President!’ I shouted. 

The hold I had on his th;oat caused him 
to throw up the hand with the revolver. 
If it hadn’t been for that ac ion he wou’.d 
have fired the other three shots. As 
soon as his band went up, Foster grabbed 
the revolver. 

"An artilleryman grabbed the weapon 
out of Secret Service Officer Foster’s hand 
and drew a big knife on him. He must 
have thought Foster looked like an an¬ 
archist. He did look more like one than 
the other did, because he had glasses and 
a three-days’ growth of beard. 

“Just then a big, fleshy officer struck 
the man that fired the shot a heavy blow 
in the face. It knocked us both down. 
The murderer tried to get up, but I held 
him down by that elbow clasp of his 
throat. If he had got up, he would have 
escaped,because the struggle was all about 
Foster, who kept crying: ‘It ain’t me that 
shot the President. There he is!’ In 
spite of that he got pommeled up by the 
artillerymen and the guards.” 


His name was Sanchez and he wanted 
a marriage license, so he raised ?2 and 
with his bride-to-be he hunted up Sam 
Kutz, the marriage, license clerk. 

“I am 23, she is 38. We live on Boyle 
Heights,’’ said Sanchez, in answer to the 
regulation questions. 

“What is your postoffice address?” 
asked Sam. 

“Boyle Heights,” was the answer 
“Yes, yes; that’s all right, but where 
on Boyle Heights?” 

“We live in the brush,” was the re¬ 
mark. 

Sam gave it up. 

The couple hurried away to get mar¬ 
ried before returning to their brush 
home. But the wedding was celebrated 
in the brush colony, where along the riv¬ 
er bottom and among the scrub live 
many Mexicans in their little huts of 
reeds and brush. 


Queen's Eitterest Enemy 

Through the death of the widow of the 
murdered Conservative, Premier Canovas, 
Queen Christina is relieved of the pres¬ 
ence of one of her most bitter foes. In¬ 
deed, it is doubtful whether there was 
anybody in Spain who hated the regent 
more intensely than this proud noble¬ 
woman, who used to be known in former 
times at Madrid as the ‘ Queen of Cuba,”

Fall Millinery 

Is here for Your Inspection and Selection: 

From the Daintiest Bonnets up to the largest 
Picture Hats. These may both be called extremes 
and all faces could not be suited with only these 
two styles. Therefore we have made every pro¬ 
vision for those requiring special shapes and sizes. 
All the New and Natty Creations in Pompadours, 
Napoleons, Continentals, Turbans, Etc., have 
temporary quarters at our store, but will soon find 
permanent resting places on the heads of fair 
wearers. We want you to be among the number.
