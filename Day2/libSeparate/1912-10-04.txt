LA FOLLETTE FOR WILSON 


Articles Show 

Warmly Commends Him in Recent 
Editorial 


Strikes a Hard Blow at Hopes of 
Roosevelt 


Madison (Wis.) Oct. 1—(Spec¬ 
ial Dispatch.) The reader of the 
five La Follette articles on Roose¬ 
velt, which will run in a series at 
intervals of a week beginning Fri¬ 
day, will come to this conclusion: 

Senator La Follette and his 
following will vote for Gov. Wil¬ 
son for President. 

Roosevelt will be out of consi¬ 
deration by the attack on him 
as a fake progressive, who is parad¬ 
ing around the country with a 
false-face platform and hollow 
promises which his record shows 
he will not endeavor to keep. 

Taft will be pictured as a con¬ 
servative, but thoroughly honest, 
a quality not conceded to Roose¬ 
velt. 

La Follette’s Advice. 

There will be no discussion of 
Wilson, but in his advice to Pro¬ 
gressives La Follette will point the 
way out of the dilemna presented 
by the Taft and Roosevelt candi¬ 
dacies. It will be this: 

Real Progressives should main¬ 
tain their organization within the 
Republican party, so that in 1916 
they will be ready to take upon 
their shoulders the task of leader¬ 
ship and the work of reform. 

To maintain this organization 
within the party bind allegiance 
to party nominee and the party 


He Will Vote for N 

declaration is not essential. No 
aid or encouragement should be 
given to a third party, which is 
trying to divide the Progressive 
Republican movement. 

In his articles La Follette will 
clothe both Taft and Roosevelt 
'with reactionary mantles and he 
will leave his readers to judge 
which of the three candidates is 
wearing a Progressive cloak. 

Friendly to Wilson. 

La Folletters magazine has taken 
an unusually kindly interest in 
Woodrow Wilson. An editorial in 
the current issue entitled, “A 
Worthy Sentiment/ 7 pours encom¬ 
iums on Gov. Wilson for the way 
he handled the New Jersey fight 
for the United States Senator. 
The editorial bears the stamp of 
La Follette’s own workmanship 
and reads in part as follows: 

“Considerations of party har¬ 
mony appear to have modified 
Woodrow Wilson 7 s opposition to 
boss Smith not in the least degree, 
Smith thought the election of Wil¬ 
son as Governor of New Jersey 
and the rise of the Democratic 
party to power in that State 
opened the way for his easy acces¬ 
sion to a seat in the United States 
Senate. Wilson thought other¬ 
wise. He declared the voice of 
the voters as expressed in the Demo¬ 
cratic primaries should prevail. A 
pitched battle ensued. Wilson was 
victorious. 

“Now Smith is again pressing 
his desire to be United States 
Senator. Perhaps it occurred to 


ew Jersey Man 

him that Wilson as a candidate 
for President, might find it inex¬ 
pedient to show the same aggres¬ 
sive opposition to him that he show¬ 
ed as Governor of the State. If 
so, he found that the other formula 
of boss politics do not apply this 
time/ 7 


COL. ROOSEVELT’S MISTAKE 


In his ambition to succeed presi¬ 
dent Taft as president of the U. 
S., Col. Roosevelt has made the 
mistake that wrecked the politi¬ 
cal hopes of both Webster and 
Blaine. Mr. Webster destroyed 
forever his chances to be president 
by voting for the infamous Fugi¬ 
tive Slave law—that law although 
violating eveiy principle of justice 
and reducing to slavery, as it did, 
every free man of the North, 
Mr. Webster voted for it to win 
over the support of the slave hold¬ 
ers to his presidential aspirations. 
That vote drove away from him 
the friends of liberty and won for 
him the bitter contempt of the 
slave holders. 

To make friends with those who 
opposed the enjoyment by the Ne¬ 
groes of their civil and political 
rights, Mr. Blaine vacated the 
speaker’s chair and went down 
upon the floor of the House to 
defeat “The Force Bill/ 7 a Grant 
administration measure designed to 
enable the Federal Government to 
enforce it guarantees of political and 
civil rights to all regardless of race or 
creed. As the result of the defeat 
of that bill, The Negroes are 
denied the right of civil protec-

tion and subject to the caprice of 
the mob from one end of the coun¬ 
try to the other. When too late, 
Mr. Blaine discovered his mistake 
and like Webster summed up his 
brilliant career in two words— 
“Disappointed Hope” 

At the outset of his administra¬ 
tion, President Taft paved the way 
for its failure by promising to violate 
the oath he was taking to uphold 
the constitution and laws of the 
country—by denying to the Negro 
citizens of the South the right to 
hold public office in that section 
unless the Democrats there agreed 
to their appointment. Pres. Taft 
was the first ruler of this great 
nation to recognize the color line 
in the performance of his duties 
as president. President Taft pos¬ 
sessed many good and great quali¬ 
ties; but when he agreed to abridge 
the rights of the Negroes, because 
they were weak, he committed 
a fatal blunder, and, as a result, 
he faces certain, humiliating defeat. 

But Col. Roosevelt is attempt¬ 
ing to secure a third term as presi¬ 
dent by repeating, in a more 
aggravated form, the blunders that 
wrecked the political fortune of 
of Webster and Blaine, and threat¬ 
ens to make president Taft a 
nonentity, the equal of the for¬ 
gotten president, Hayes. Col. 
Roosevelt's now famous “Julian 
Harris letter," reduced to its logi¬ 
cal conclusion, would nullify the 
rights of the entire Negro race. 

President Taft would recognize 
the rights of Southern Negroes to 
hold office—provided that no white 
man of that section opposed it. 
In other words, he would make 
the Negro’s enjoyment of his con¬ 
stitutional rights depend upon the 
willingness of his white neighbor 
to respect them. 

Col. Roosevelt, to get the South¬ 
ern white vote and the Northern 
Negro vote, would go president 
Taft one better—by completely 
nullifying the Southern Negroes’ 
constitutional rights, until such a 
time in the remote future, that the 
people with whom the Negroes 
are competing, will regard them¬ 
selves as far enough ahead to grant 
the Negro the exercise of his 


God-given rights without incon¬ 
venience to themselves. 

President Taft, so far as we have 
been able to learn, has made no 
attempt to keep Southern Negroes 
out of National Conventions; but 
Col. Roosevelt, head of the Progres¬ 
sive Party, agreed to their exclusion 
from the Progressive National Con¬ 
vention at its very outset. 

Col. Roosevelt professes great 
friendship for the Negro race, and 
proposes to prove it by abridging 
their constitutional rights. The 
slave holders took the same posi¬ 
tion and claimed that the best way 
to promote the Negro’s interest 
was to keep him in slavery. The 
Colonel is, doubtless, well acquaint¬ 
ed with the history of the world 
and its people; but we doubt his 
ability to point out a single instnace 
where the opportunities of a people 
have been increased by keeping 
them in shakles. Brownsville 
might have been forgotten; but 
the “Julian Harris letter" will 
prove a political millstone about 
Col. Rooseveltis neck. If after 
he bolted the Republican Conven¬ 
tion at Chicago and formed his 
new third party he had made the 
absolute freedom of every Ameri¬ 
can citizen to enjoy his constitu¬ 
tional rights, without regard to 
race, color or section, one of the 
cardinal principles of the Progres¬ 
sive party, he not only would have 
secured the 600,000 Negro votes 
of the North, but would have 
challenged the admiration of the 
people of the South, and been 
swept into the presidential chair. 
As planks in Col. Roosevelt’s new 
third party platform his “Door of 
Hope” and his “All men up and 
not some men down," would have 
proven a talisman, that would have 
attracted to his party the lovers 
of liberty, and seekers for larger 
opportunities in every section of 
the country. 

But the Colonel has crossed the 
Rubicon. 


THE LADIES OF THE BOOKER 
T. WASHINGTON ART AND 
INDUSTRIAL CLUB ENTER¬ 
TAINS. EDITOR EDMONDS 
PAYS GLOWING TRIBUTE 
TO WOMEN OF THE RACE. 


The reception tendered their 
husbands by the ladies of the Book¬ 
er T. Washington Industrial and 
Art Club, at the home of Mrs. 
A. Lively, 910 East 32nd street, 
on the evening of Sept. 26th, was 
one of the pleasantest as well as 
the most profitable entertainments 
of the season. The spacious front 
rooms were tastefully decorated; 
the color scheme being green and 
yellow. These, with a .profusion 
of cut flowers, gave the place the 
appearance of a fairy land. 

At an early hour the guests 
arrived; every section of the city 
being represented. The beauti¬ 
ful suburb of Hollywood sent in 
its full quota showing that Holly¬ 
wood is taking a lively interest 
in the good work the Club is 
doing. 

Music was furnished by Masters 
Perry and Patrick, young musi¬ 
cians who have charge of the Club’s 
orchestra, which is made up entire¬ 
ly of young boys and girls. 

The club has given the young 
people of the neighborhood a pro¬ 
minent place in the organization, 
and many of the exhibits of ex¬ 
cellent handiwork are contribu¬ 
tions of the young people. The 
club is putting forth special efforts 
to keep the young people in school, 
and is rapidly raising a fund to 
open a place of business that will 
furnish them employment in keep¬ 
ing with their fitness. This will 
be strictly an industrial store and 
the goods sold will be largely 
manufactured by the club. Fur¬ 
niture and house furnishings, made 
by the club members, will consti¬ 
tute the bulk of the stock. One 
of the club members has promised 
a long lease free on a lot upon which 
the club will erect a building. 
The club is preparing to give a 
public exhibit in a short time at 
which visitors from ail over the 
city will be invited. 

















THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


Program. 

After a short program the speak¬ 
er of the evening,. the editor of 
this journal, delivered a short 
address, devoting his time mainly 
to what the colored women have 
contributed to race progress. 
He highly complimented the ladies 
of the club for the efforts they were 
putting forth to keep the boys and 
girls in school and at the same 
time preparing to make them self- 
supporting on the conclusion of 
their education. Discussing the 
nobility of Negro womanhood, he 
showed how far hundreds of years, 
the dominant race around us have 
thrown every protection possible 
around their women. The}' have 
given them education, and comfort, 
and leisure, for physical and mental 
culture, placed them in splendid 
homes, provided them with every¬ 
thing to delight the eye and stimu¬ 
late the imagination; the walls 
of the living rooms of the mothers 
were decorated with splendid paint¬ 
ings and costly statuary. With 
an eye to the future, this was done 
that children born amid such pleas¬ 
ing surroundings would make men 
and women as physically and men¬ 
tally perfect as human beings could 
be. 

“Note the difference: For more 
than two hundred years your 
mothers were slaves having nothing 
they could call their own, not 
even their bodies. The men 
who owned the black women made 
their virtue a plaything. Amid 
cheerless and uninviting surround¬ 
ings, amidst squalor and want, 
their children were forced to be 
born out of wedlock, placed upon 
the auction block, sold as articles 
of merchandise and scattered like 
the leaves of the forest. Thus, 
generation after generation, went 
through that heart-crushing mill. 
In spite of all these hardships and 
heart-breaking scenes, your mothers 
have given the country some of 
its greatest soldiers, statesmen, 
philosophers, scholars and poets; 
and it is conceedecl today that the 
only American music is that which 
originated in the souls of your 
noble mothers. Although their 
homes were poor, with no paintings 


or statuary to lend a charm to the 
cheerless walls of their cabins, they 
furnished the country with men and 
women whose physical develop¬ 
ment, beauty and intellectual 
equipments are second to none un¬ 
der the sun. 

“Look about you, and you will 
find that the percentage of mental 
and physical deformity is less 
among you than any other people 
while the percentage of physical 
beauty is as great as that of others. 
The power to think and construct 
where opportunity is equal, is 
nowhere wanting. These are tho 
tests by which time estimates the 
worth of a people. These are the 
tests by which you are to be meas¬ 
ured in years to come. These 
things show that although your 
mothers possessed neither material 
power nor wealth, they possessed 
that which is better—pure hearts, 
nobility of character, beautiful and 
vivid imaginations. Taking no 
part in the sins they were forced 
by their masters to commit, hence 
they transmitted to posterity 
only the best that was in them. 
These are a few of the things which 
your mothers accomplished- under 
the most adverse circumstances. 
Free from their handicaps, the 
future of your race is very largely 
in your hands. What the Negroes 
of the next century are to be is 
in the hands of the Negroes of 
today. I congratulate the ladies 
and members of this club for the 
high place you are trying to make 
for the young people of this city. 
It is high time that some one should 
commence the work, that you are 
doing. The fact that there are 
twenty thousand of us in this city 
and that the men among is in 
spite of the thousands of dollars 
they earn annually do not furnish 
employment for twenty skilled 
young men and women only goes 
to show the importance of your 
work and its urgent necessity.” 

The editor closed his address 
by making a strong plea to the 
ladies urging the necessity of edu¬ 
cation—the practical education, 
that one gets after leaving school; 

“Books,” he said, “tell only of 
the past, they fit us for grappling 


with the future, but the education 
which fits us for dealing with the 
present, the education which makes 
us practical men and women of 
today is the education we get from 
the study of the newspapers and 
magazines that come from the 
press by the thousands daily, week¬ 
ly and monthly. The people who 
fail to read the newspapers and 
magazines are ignorant for all 
practical purposes of today even 
though they hold college diplomas. 
When the Negro becomes well 
acquainted with himself by read¬ 
ing his own books and papers he 
will no longer need look elsewhere 
for ideals, but will find that his 
own race has furnished ideals in 
abundance, and when in want of 
inspiration, he will read the writ¬ 
ings and orations of Douglass, 
Dunbar, Du Bois, Booker T. Wash¬ 
ington, Kelly Miller and a host 
of others. As a race we are rich 
in ideals in every noble depart¬ 
ment of life. The trouble with us 
is that we are ignorant of our own 
achievemnto. If we would read 
and support our own newspapers 
we would soon discover that 
some of the most brilliant news¬ 
paper men in the country are 
Negroes. If the Negro press of 
this country had the support of 
the Negroes a powerful press would 
spring up which would change the 
sentiment of the country towards 
us and their power would be felt 
and the “Door of Hope” every¬ 
where be forced wide open. If the 
Negroes of America are to enjoy 
their constitutional rights they will 
have to own and operate a power¬ 
ful press to build up a sentiment 
fovorable to the enforcement 
of law regardless of race or creed. 
This, they can and must do. 

At the close of the address re¬ 
freshments consisting of sandwiches, 
cream pie, punch, cakes, candies 
and ice cream, all furnished by 
the baking department of the club. 

The follwoing guest were present:

PRES. TAFT, COL. ROOSEVELT 
OR GOV. WILSON—WHICH? 


The Negro voters of the country 
are face to face with a situation 
they have never met before. They 
have a choice of three presidential 
candidates: Pres. Taft, candidate 
of the old line Republican; Col. 
Roosevelt, Bull Mooser Republi¬ 
can candidate; and Gov. Wilson, 
candidate of the Democracy. 
Pres. Taft’s Southern Negro policy 
has made him unpopular with the 
Negroes everywhere. Col. Roose¬ 
velt’s “Julian Harris letter” and 
the Brownsville memories have 


won for him the solid hostility of 
the leading Negroes throughout 
the land. Of Gov. Wilson not 
much is known, so far as the 
Negro is concerned. However, the 
fact that the leading Negroes of 
of his state are loyally supporting 
him is significant. With respect 
to the Negroes, Mr. Taft’s platform 
is his “Southern Negro policy.” 
Col. Roosevelt’s platform is his 
“Julian Harris Letter.” From the 
above it will be seen that both 
Pres. Taft and Col. Roosevelt 
recognize race, color and section 
in their platform. 

Gov. Wilson says: “If elected 
president I will be president of 
the whole nation. I will know no 
white or black, no North or South, 
no East or West, no home-born 
or foreign-born; but will treat 
every citizen according to the law. 
If, as president of the United States, 
any law should be passed by Con¬ 
gress abridging the rights of the 
Negroes I would veto it.” 

You have here the positions of 
the three principle candidates re¬ 
specting the rights of the Negro. 
While it is true these men are only 
representatives of parties, as 
president, their policies, respecting 
the Negroe’s rights, whether favor¬ 
able or unfavorable, will be very 
apt to become the nation’s policy. 
Hence, while the Negro is debating 
this subject, it would be well 
to pay some attention to the 
individuals. 

It must not be taken for granted 
that Mr. Debs will be over-looked 
by the colored voters. On the 
contrary he will receive thousands 
of their votes. 

Out of all this confusion of presi¬ 
dential candidates the Negro will 
be benefited. It will not be posi- 
sible this year to repeat the blunder 
that has so long proven fatal to 
their rights—voting solidly for one 
party regardless of issues. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


The address to men only, deliver¬ 
ed at Wesley Chapel by Rev. 
Charles Stewart last Sunday af¬ 
ternoon, under the auspices of the 
Y. M. C. A., was attended by a 


large audience. The absence of 
boys from 14 to 20 years was not 
only noticeable but regrettable as 
well. Dr. Stewart vividly described 
the dreadful effects upon the health 
and character of the race by ig¬ 
norance of hygiene and fast living. 
And the warning that he gave those 
present should have been heard 
by every young colored man in 
the city. 


The El Dorado Gold Star Min¬ 
ing Company, having employed 
an expert mining engineer, have 
commenced development work in 
earnest. They expect to reach 
paying ore in a short time. The two 
years work since reorganization 
have been productive of much en¬ 
couragement to the Company. 
The engineer declares that 60 feet 
more of development work will 
open up the mine in good shape 
and put it on a paying basis. 


Under the auspices of the Lit¬ 
erary department of the Epworth 
League, Rev. Chas. Stewart de¬ 
livered his lecture: “Uncle Ned and 
His Son,” to a crowded house. 
The lecture proved both instruc¬ 
tive and amusing. 


THE LYCEUM’S DEBATE 


The debate: “Resolved that the 
Progressive Party ought not to 
have the Negro Vote,” will be con¬ 
tinued at the Lyceum next Sunday. 
The debate is attracting consider¬ 
able attention, big crowds attend¬ 
ing the meetings. All persons are 
allowed three minutes to discuss 
the subject, while the jmdges are 
preparing their decision. 

Messrs. E. B. McClellan and 
L. A. Watson will again take the 
affirmative, and Mr. J. Thos. Nor¬ 
ris and Miss Maude Morrison will 
take the negative. Those wishing 
to hear a live, interesting discus¬ 
sion will do well to visit the Ly¬

THE GREATNESS OF THE OLIVE IS THE 
GREATNESS OF GIBRALTAR. The advance 
of California land values is the advance of GIB¬ 
RALTAR. The strength of co-operation is the 
strength of GIBRALTAR AND IS BACK OF 
THE EARNING POWER OF YOUR DOLLAR. 
1287 SHAREHOLDERS are back of GIBRALTAR 
and have given it the weight of their approval. 
The largest olive nurseries in the world are joined 
to the greatest prosperity of the olive industry 
which this country has ever known in assuring 
big profits on every dollar invested. Subdividing 
land and selling orchards planted from our im¬ 
mense stock of growing olive and orange trees 
are a big factor in assuring the sale of stock for 
15c by January 1. PREFERRED STOCK IS 
UNLIMITED IN SHARING ALL GREATER 
PROFITS BEYOND THE 8% GUARANTEED.
