hey leave school and grow up in ig¬

ter they are older they often see the 
need of education, and if these was a 
night school for our people many would 
go. 1 have been in such schools when 
m .®“ 1° years olfl came in and began 
with the alphabet, waling to study 
hard for the rudiments of an educa¬ 
tion.' 

He told the story of a young colored 
girl in Los Angeles who was denied ad¬ 
mission to one of the local private 
schools because of her race, and said 


that the management gave as an bxcusp 
for excluding her that there were some 
Southern pupils in the school who 
would probacy leave if she were ad-

against in many cases, although we are 

supposed to have equal rights so far as 

pres* 1 '* 1 * C scboo,s are concerned.”_Ex- 

The above from an interview with 
Rev. Chandler by the Express reporter 
is indeed strange reading to those ac¬ 
quainted with the splendid educational 
advantages offered to its youths by this 
state and city without regard to race, 
color or condition.- A college education 
is offered every youth in the state free 
of charge. Now ,if they refuse it whose 
fault is it? To attribute it to race or 
color prejudice is to make a statement 
that cannot be borne out by facts. 
“There are few of our children,” he 
says, “who ever reach the high school, 
just because they are disheartened be¬ 
fore they advance far enough. There 
are many more white boys and girls in 
this state who never reach to the high 
school than there are negroes, count¬ 
ing men, women and children. Thou¬ 
sands of white children leave the com¬ 
mon school every year before they 
reach the seventh grade. 

What disheartened them—race pre¬ 
judice? In both cases it is largely due 
to the fact that they are allowed to do 
about as they pleased. In this connec¬ 
tion we regret to say that too many 
parents, both white and black, take less 
care of their children than they do of 
their poodle dogs. The refusal to ad¬ 
mit colored children into private 
schools is no argument in favor of 
drawing the color line in the public 
schools, if there are colored people • 
who prefer to send their children to a 
private school let them organize such a 
school. To say that any considerable 


number of colored children have left 
the public schools on account of race 
prejudice and are growing up in ignor¬ 
ance in consequence, is to cast a seri¬ 
ous, uncalled for reflection upon an 
honorable corps of teachers and officers 
who are actuated by the highest mo¬ 
tives. This we are satisfied Rev. Chand¬ 
ler would not knowingly do. There is 
more or less race prejudice everywhere 
in this country, and California is no ex¬ 
ception, but it has not driven a single 
colored child from the public schools of 
this state who wanted to learn. It has 
not kept one out who wanted to learn. 
This cry about race prejudice is the fa¬ 
vorite dodge of every colored boy and 
girl who want to leave school to hang 
around the street and visit dives and 
dens of vice, and the pity of it is, they 
have no one at home to protest against 
their downward course. 


COLORED SCHOOL TRUSTEES. 

We know several cases where colored 
men are serving as trustees of schools 
m their respective school districts, al¬ 
though their entire districts contained 
from 2 to 6 colored children each, the 
balance, numbering sereval hundred, 
being white. Was it race prejudice or 
the absence of race prejudice that 
prompted the white citizens to elect 
these negroes to assist in supervising 
their schools? In each case, however, 
the colored men elected are heavy prop¬ 
erty holders and public spirited citizens. 
Mr. G. W. Albright, the well known 
colored orator, is trustee of one of our 
suburban schools. 

Not long ago a colored minister of 
this city was nominated for member of 
the school board, a position that would 
have enabled him to stand between the 
colored children and race prejudice, if 
any existed, but he was so well pleased 
with the happy condition of the colored 
children in the city schools, he refused 
to let the people elect him, which they 
certainly would have done had he con¬ 
sented to run. Now to boil this whole 
matter down the colored people, that is,

the intelligent, enterprising element 
among them, are satisfied with the gen¬ 
erous provisions now existing for the 
education of their children, and while 
they would not object to mix teachers 
for mixed schools, they will never aid 
in drawing the color line in the public 
schools by establishing colored schools. 
In the mixed schools in New York and 
Illinois these are mixed teachers and the 
world is moving on just the same. But 
this question need not be discussed. In 
no state in the Union are the colored 
people better treated than they are in 
California. Few states offer its colored 
citizens better opportunities to acquire 
and enjoy wealth than California does. 
The churches, schools and colleges of 
this state, like the truths of our pre¬ 
cious Bible, are open free to all. 


Thereisno Negro 
Question 

Says the Washington Post. 

Ignorant White Voters are 
as Dangerous as Ignor¬ 
ant Negro Voters. 

THE POST AND THE RACE QUES¬ 
TION. 

The Washington, D. C., Post goes to 
the root of the matter when under the 
caption of “ i'oo Much of the Negro 
Question” it says: 

“There is no negro question of any 
great importance that cannot be solved 
by the very simplest of processes. 
We have only to treat the negroes un¬ 
der genera] rules applying alike to all 
other classes of our heterogeneous pop¬ 
ulation and pay no further attention to 
them as negroes.” 

“Why should we concern ourselves 
about the negro any more than about 
the Sicilian, the Malay, the German, 
the Russian, or the Portuguese? Why 
should they be segregated and set 
apart as a specially favored people? It 
is true that for tw'O or three centuries 


they were slaves, but they have been 
free for forty years., and during that 
period they have enjoyed the same ad¬ 
vantages of education and opportuni¬ 
ties of improvement that have been 
offered the whites. It is a fact, indeed, 
that nine-tenths of the complaints and 
agitation proceed from negroes who 
were born free, wnile the few survi¬ 
vors of slavery are as a rule well con¬ 
tented with their lot. The truth is 
that a dispassionate examination of 
their present attitude reveals more of a 
pretense of superiority than a petition 
for equality. They make the negro 
question themselves with an imprudent 
and clamorous demand for what they 
call ‘recognition.* ” 

The Post continues: 

“The state owes nothing to the 
negro more than to any other citizen— 
that is to say, it owes protection of his 
life and property, equal rights before 
the law, equal facilities for education. 
We do not approve—on the contrary, 
we deplore and denounce—the exclu¬ 
sion of the negro from the ballot box 
merely because of his race and color. 
In our opinion the illiterate, shiftless, 
and irresponsible whites make just as 
bad citizens as do negroes of the same 
kind. Suffrage laws should not dis¬ 
criminate. They should take note of 
all disqualifications, mental, moral, or 
material, and apply them to whites 
and blacks alike. Under that arrange¬ 
ment—and it prevails in nearly every 
part of the country—the negro has no 
excuse for annoying his neighbors 
with childish reproaches and recrimina¬ 
tions. If he wants to become a capital¬ 
ist, let him set about it as white men 
have had to do; if he wants to get 
into society, let him make himself 
eligible and and acceptable to those 
who control its entrances. He will 
never become rich by loafing around 
and living on the wages of confiding 
cooks and chambermaids, nor will he 
endear himself to society by sticking 
out his under lip and looking for a 
casus belli every hour 01 the day.” 

“None of this applies to the honest, 
industrious and self-respecting colored 
people, who can be found in hundreds 
of thousands between the Potomac and 
Gulf of Mexico. It applies to the push¬ 
ing, impertinent, half-educated and 
wholly futile negroes w'lio are making 
all this tiresome noise. 


“Any one who has read history 
knows that there is no royal road to 
wealth, power, greatness, influence for 
race or class. The race that rules more 
than half the civilized world today 
lived in caves like the hears 2000 years 
ago. The Latins who rule the rest of 
it knew the meaning of civilization 
only a few centuries earlier. Egypt 
was the examplar of culture, the arts 
and sciences, when all the Caucasian 
races were steeped in a hideous and 
appalling barbarism. But none of 
these races rose to eminence and dom¬ 
ination by complaining of injustice 
and persecution. What they got they 
earned. What they received they were 
entitled to. Nations, peoples, individ¬ 
uals, stand or fall upon their merits. 
Social evolution is not affected by silly 
outcry and peevish lamentation. 

“We are weary of this ‘Negro Ques¬ 
tion.’ It is nonsense.” 


WHAT WILL MY SON DO? 

Ask any one of the numerous par¬ 
ents whose children are hanging 
around the street, why they don’t send 
them to school and invariably the 
the query will come: What will they 
do after they are educated? They will 
go to work and make a place for them¬ 
selves if they are worthy of existence. 
Just think of the amount of honorable 
labor there is to be done to keep the 
world going. There will be men to be 
made and homes to be built and to 
beautify, forests to fell, lands to till, 
and factories to fill. There is our 
great country to be developed and gov¬ 
erned. There will be victories to be 
won and crowns to wear; kind words 
to be spoken, noble deeds to be per¬ 
formed; the world to save from sin 
and heaven to enter in. Nothing for 
your children to do in the midst of all 
of this glorious work? Shall your 
children starve in the thoroughfare of 
plenty? Although we have mentioned 
only a few of the small pieces of work 
that is to be performed. Yet, it must 
be performed by educated men and 
women.

WHY EDWARDS KILLED 
FOSTER. 


HE STRIKES EDWARDS’ WIFE, 


THE BURNING OF SAM HOSE 
RECALLED. 

From a reliable source we received 
the following particulars of the killing 
of Foster at Benton, La., by Edwards, 
which are as follows: On the morning of 
the killing, Foster went to the field 
where Edwards, his wife and a number 
of laborers were cnopping cotton. After 
abusing Mrs. Edwards, Foster slapped 
her, whereupon he was knocked down 
by some one supposed to be Edwards. 
Foster got up mounted his horse and 
rode rapidly to the house for his gun 
as the sequel showed. In the meantime 
Edwards and his. wife took refuge in 
their cabin and none too soon for Fos¬ 
ter returned armed with two six shoot¬ 
ers and accompanied by the overseer 
who was also armed. When informed 
that Edwards and his wife had gone 
to their cabin, Foster and his body 
guard followed and on reaching the 
yard, tied their horses and with a pis¬ 
tol in each hand Foster and the negro 
driver approached Edwards’ cabin, 
whereupon Edwards armed with a dou¬ 
ble barreled shot gun stepped in front 
of his door and shot Foster dead thus 
saving his own life and that of h's wife. 
He did not shoot Foster from ambush 
as reported in the Associated Press, 
but in the precise manner as stated 
above. The killing would have been 
justifiable under the circumstances if 
Edwards had shot from ambbush as 
most men would have done. The unex¬ 
pected appearance of Edwards in front 
of his cabin with shot gun paralyzed 
both Foster and his body guard. When 
Foster fell dead the negro driver threw 
away his guns and crie lustily for 
mercy which was given. Armed with 
the guns of his would be slayers, Ed¬ 
wards quietly walked away from the 
scene with the air of a man determined 
to sell his life as dear as possible. 
That’s why the Louisana mob has 
been so careful to avoid a meeting 
with him unless reliably informed that 
he was dead or unarmed and securely 


chained. Although the facts as stated 
above were well known to the people 
of that community, false reports were 
sent out and preparations were made 
to burn him at the stake if he could be 
captured asleep or unarmed. It was 
also well known that the other negroes 
on the farm had no more to do with the 
killing than the governor of that state, 
and the murder of Rev. Smith and Mc- 
Land was one of the most cold blooded 
murders in the history of mob mur¬ 
ders except me murder of Rev. Lige 
Strickland after the burning of Sam 
Hose. 

Hose, it will be remembered killed 
his employer near Atlanta, Ga. in self 
defense, according to the statement of 
the deadman’s wife. She says that 
Hose called upon her husband for a 
settlement and after a few words her 
husband, whom she says was very 
quick tempered, ran into the house, 
secured his revolver and ran out, she 
followed him only to see him killed by 
an axe thrown by Hose who imme¬ 
diately left the place. As is always the 
case false reports were sent to the 
country which were readily believed. 
Hose was charged with killing the man 
at the latter's supper table, then out¬ 
raging his wife all of which were 
known to be false bby Clark Howell, 
editor of the Constitution and his gang. 
Hose was captured and turned over to 
the mob, who notified all of the white 
people in the surrounding towns in¬ 
cluding Atlanta, the capital of the 
state to bring their wives and young 
ladies to see him burned alive. Ac¬ 
cordingly churches and Sunday schools 
were abandoned and every body. re¬ 
paired to the scene. Perfectly nude, 
in an elevated position, the victim was 
chained to an iron stake in full view 
of the women and children. The ears 
of the victim together with nameless 
portions of his body were cut off and 
sold to the highest bidder. With knives 
in their hands the members of the mob 
fought for an opportunity to cut a 
slice out of his quivering flesh for a 
memento. After this shocking manner 
of torture had been carried to excess 
without bringing from the victim the 
slightest expression of pain, fire was 
brought and what remained of the 
spark of life was slowly burned out. 
When his baked liver protruded from 
a hole made by knives and fire the 


mob again fought for slices which were 
sold at 35 cents each. As far as Hose 
was concerned the tragedy was ended 
and his innocent spirit had returned 
to the God who gave it. His troubles 
were over, not so with the mob. Not 
so with the country that permitted it, 
not so with women ana children who 
witnessed it. The image of that crime 
and the horrid appearance of that tor¬ 
tured victim will be transmitted by 
them to their posterity. Nothing re¬ 
ceives and transmits images so per¬ 
fectly as woman.

ALL IS WELL. 

The God of love who reigns above 
Placed me on earth to dwell; 

He’ll guide my feet to waters sweet, 

I feel that all is well. 

If Truth and Right and reason’s light, 
Within my spirit dwell. 

They’ll banish tears and blinding fears 
They teach me all is well. 

When fleeting breath or pain and 
death, 

Or seething waters swell, 

This beacon light will banish night, 

I know that all is well. 

This is my song when troubles throng, 
And this I love to tell; 

In weal or woe, Oh, this I know 
That all, that all is well. 

When my eyes close in death’s repose, 
And I bid earth farewell, 

Oh, may I say without dismay, 

I know that all is well.

A FITTING RECOGNITION. 

Our bright local contemporary, the 
Liberator, says: “The recognition re¬ 
ceived by colored voters of this state at 
the hands of Governor Gage, by the po¬ 
sition given Mr. Wickliffe, is a splen¬ 
did victory for the independent colored 
voters.” The extract alludes to the 
appointment of G. W. Wickliffe, a 
promising young colored attorney, to a 
$1200 clerkship in the office of the board 
of harbor commissioners at San Fran¬ 
cisco. The appointment was probably 
made, however, solely on the ground of 
the personal fitness of the appointee, 
coupled with a recognition of the fact 
that capability and ■ not color is the 
proper test of fitness. 

The appointment which the Liberator 
thus commends should help to dispel 
the pessimism which that paper is wont 
to display in discussing the prospects 
of the colored people. For example, it 
says, relative to the recent decision of 
the supreme court in the insular cases: 
“The people owe obedience to no court 
that orders them to disobey the golden 
rule.” That rule is admirable as a 
moral law and theoretically perfect, but 
mankind will have to reach a higher 


plane of evolution before the rule is 
adopted in all circumstances of life. A 
little reflection will convince our zeal¬ 
ous contemporary on that point. Nor 
is it wise to hold the Republican party 
responsible for outrages in the south 
which it deplores and deprecates, but 
is powerless to stop. But the Liber¬ 
ator means well, as this extract proves: 
“We love law, but hate lawlessness. To 
plead for the enforcement of the laws 
is the best proof one can give of his 
devotion to the women and children of 
his country. To help make the law 
supreme is to glorify God.”—The Her¬ 
ald. 

Our esteemed contemporary, The 
Herald, says: “The appointment of Mr. 
Wickliffe was probably made however, 
solely on the ground of the personal fit¬ 
ness of the appointee.” Upon this point 
we take no issue with the Herald, but it 
was the independent colored voters un¬ 
der the leadership of the Liberator 
that caused the discovery of his per¬ 
sonal fitness. This appointment is 
hailed by the colored voters of this 
state as the dawn of better things. If 
the negro continues to become less par¬ 
tisan and more American in his voting 
there will be other discoveries made 
that will benefit him. Rampant par¬ 
tisanship is poor politics. The solid 
negro vote has injured the negro, just 
as the solid South has been detrimental 
to the South.

Mrs. C. E. Jeremiah, of San Fran¬ 
cisco, a former resident of South Pas¬ 
adena is visiting her friends and for¬ 
mer neighbors. As she came entirely 
unheralded her visit was the most 
agreeable surprise that they have had 
for some time. The improvement in 
her health and appearance is so marked 
that some of her friends could hardly 
recognize her. Mr. Jeremiah’s friends 
were pained to hear that he was suffer¬ 
ing with rheumatism. Mr. and Mrs. J. 
L. Edmunds entertained Mrs. Jeremiah 
at dinner on the 9th inst. Mr. and Mrs. 
Jeremiah will shortly make Portland, 
Oregon their permanent residence. 


MR. B. R. RANDOLPH. 

Mr. Randolph, our popular police¬ 
man, will spend his vacation in San 
Francisco. He has made a good record 
on the police force, and the residents 
on his beat feel that their persons and 
property is safe when he is on duty. He 
is a dignified, and fine looking officer. 


Much of the colored prejudice that 
exists in this state is due to a certain 
class of negroes who will themselves 
draw the color line whenever they im¬ 
agine that they can profit by it. They 
run from the color line in one section 
of the country, then persist in drawing 
it where they stop if it does not already 
exist. The more attention you give to 
the things that will add to the prosper¬ 
ity of your community, the more you 
will be treated as a citizen. The less 
you think abbout your color, the better 
it will be for you.

THE SOUTH’S MISTAKES. 

“The mistakes of my life have been 
many,” addresses itself to our dear 
southland with unusual force at this 
time, as there seems to be no news 
from that section, but its mobs and un¬ 
constitutional constitutional conven¬ 
tions, which are now attempting to le¬ 
galize nullification. The money that 
should be spent in educating the ignor¬ 
ant white and black masses of that 
section is being squandered by conven¬ 
tions to legislate the manhood out of 
the negroes and poor whites. The 
time that the people of that section 
should be devoting to the develop¬ 
ment of its great natural resources to 
the promotion of commerce and gen¬ 
eral prosperity, is now, under the 
leadership of demagogues.being wasted 
in the attempt to degrade the very la¬ 
borers to whom they owe the little 
prosperity they now possess. The 
negro’s labor has made the South bud 
and blossom like the rose. He cleared 
her forests, built her cities, educated 
her people. For his two hundred and 
fifty years of unrequitted toil he asks 
not a cent. Against those ' who 
wronged him in the past he cherishes 
no resentment. He stands with his 
face to the future and his back to the 
past. The demagogues are trying to 
turn him around. The mob seems de¬ 
termined to turn him around or put 
him in the ground. They can do the 
latter, but never the former. The 
• negro is free, he is going to remain 
so. To future prosperity of the South 
demands it. When the South enslaved 
the negro she made a mistake; when 
she purchased the slaves of the North¬ 
ern slave holders, who sold their slaves 
because they could not make the busi¬ 
ness pay, she made a mistake. The 
belief that slavery is the best condi¬ 
tion for labor is a mistake. The agi¬ 
tation for the extension of slavery was 
a mistake. The Dred Scott decision, 
the fugitive slave law and the firing up¬ 
on Fort Sumter, were mistakes. The 
organization of the Ku Klux Klau and 
the toleration of its offspring—the mob 
—are mistakes. The attempt to legis¬ 
late the negro out of his rights, to 
tax him without representation, to dis¬ 
franchise him and yet count him for 
congressional apportionment, is a seri¬ 
ous blunder, and, like slavery, will 


work great injury to the South. Al¬ 
ready the making of the so-called ne¬ 
gro question the paramount issue of 
every campaign has dwarfted Southern 
manhood, driven statesmen from the 
halls of legislation and filled their 
places with mob leaders and pigmies 
It has driven the Haynes and Hamp¬ 
tons from the federal senate to make 
room for brainless blackguards of the 
Pitchfork Tillman type. For the past 
three quarters of a century everything 
has been sacrificed to fixing the “nig¬ 
ger.” It has stifled her industries, 
denied the entry of capital, suspended 
the operation of the law and set up 
the rule of the mob. History will re¬ 
peat itself. If our Democratic breth¬ 
ren of the South keep up the pace at 
which they are going in the disfran¬ 
chising business self-preservation will 
compell the North to treat the inequal¬ 
ity of suffrage they persist in producing 
just as it did slavery. Then the South 
will need the assistance of the negro to 
keep that section from becoming a non- 
enity. The policy of the South toward 
the negro is wrong.

Miss Kittie E. Bradly had one of the 
fingers on her left hand so badly 
crushed by being caught in the machin¬

sincerely regretted by her friends. Miss

still send forth sweet strains of music 
at her bidding.

“LORD, YOU PROMISED TO BE 
WITH ME NOW,” 

Were the words of “Prophet” or Rev. 
Smith, as he and McLand were being 
led away by a mob at Benton, La., that 
had decided to hang them for being on 
the farm when Edwards shot Foster. 
Though guilty of no crime, in spite of 
his pleadings for another opportunity 
to see his loved ones, he was led away 
to the slaughter by the mob. 
“Unmindful," though a weeping wife, 
And helpless offspring mourned.” 

His plea for mercy fell like mist up¬ 
on the rocks of a desert. Without re¬ 
dress his widow and orphans must 
bear their loss alone. There are none 
who dare offer consolation; no Red 
Cross society to relieve their wants. 
The constitution guarantees them and 
their race nothing. The stars and 
stripes offer them no refuge beneath 
its folds. Slavery had its day, so well 
the mob, but the end must come. 

“For God hath marked each sorrow¬ 
ing hour, 

And numbered every secret tear. 

In heaven’s long age of bliss will pay 
For what his children suffer here.”

The prompt action of Governor Gage 
in the Modoc lynching and his offer 
of $5000 for the apprehension and con¬ 
viction of the murderers is indeed 
commendable and shows that the gov¬ 
ernor is not in sympathy with the mob 
mania that is now disgracing the 
whole country. It was the most cold¬ 
blooded uncalled for murder that has 
occurred in this state for years. It is 
sincerely hoped that the good citizens 
of Modoc county will assist the author¬ 
ities in bringing the murderers to jus¬ 
tice. 

The cold-blooded murder of an old 
man of 72 years and bis sons on a 
larceny charge 4s so inhuman that 
language is inadequate to properly de¬ 
scribe it. 


Mr. William A. Willyms, a distin¬ 
guished scholar and linguist and class¬ 
mate of Archbishop Corrigan, died 
in New York on the 1st. He was the 
sacristan of the Roman Catholic 
church of St. Benedict, the Moor. He 
was the son of a Viginia slave, and was 
educated in Rome for the priesthood.
