FORMER PREACHER WEEPS ALL 
DAY IN COUNTY JAIL 


Mr. John W. Watson, white, a 
former minister of the gospel is 
facing serious charges concerning 
his financial deals. Preaching was 
too slow. 

Accusers Legion. 

The “get-rich-quick” deals ^of 
Watson are said to have netted him 
a large sum of money in the last 
year. Here are some of the things 
of which he is accused: 

Embezzlement of $2,500 from 
William W. Phalen by a “ second 
mortgage deal.” He was convicted 
on this charge. 

Accused of swindling Henry Col¬ 
ton, Frank and Lillian Broman, A. 
and Ollithea Thelander, and Minnie 
E. Blighton out of $1,300. 

J. H. Buchanan, retired capitalist 
formerly of Pueblo, Colo., claims 
Watson swindled him out of $15,000 
in various deals. 

A. J. Edgar, No. 429 West Sixty- 
ninth street, claims to have been 
swindled in a $1,200 note deal. 

Alleged to have embezzled $300 
from Mrs. F. : D. Truckmiller of 
Pasadena. 

Attorney J. A. Donnell declares 
Watson secured $2,600 from a 
client of his by fraudulent means. 

Mrs. F. C. Fleming of No. 1041 
Marengo avenue, Pasadena, says 
,she lost $2,750 she entrusted to 
Watson to invest. 

Miss S. N. Landis, a sister of 
Mrs. Fleming, claims to have lost 
$1,000 in a similar manner. 


Hinister in Jail for 
Embezzlement. 


Ella Baker, a poor woman, says 
she lost $1,200 through buying a 
house of Watson which later burned 
down. Watson is said to have 
sold the furniture that was saved 
and to have collected the insurance, 
keeping the money for his own uses. 

Joseph Tanner says he lost $1,000 
through a Watson deal. 

Anna Stewart asserts she lost 
$1,5000. 

Dr. S. F. Kurpiers of Boyle 
Heights alleges he lost $3250 in a 
deal with Watson. 

Watson had an office in the Cur¬ 
rier building. 

Watson, who lives at 635 Hobart 
boulevard, was arrested just after 
he had alighted in the downtown 
district from an automobile in 
which were seated his wife and 
daughter. He was tried in the 
Phalen case and was convicted. 
Judge McCormick refused to grant 
him a new trial and now his attorney 
Jud Rush, is making preparations 
to appeal the case. 


SEEK WHITE MURDERS TO 
LYNCH THEM IN N. C. 


White Southern Men Cut Throats 
of White Man and Wife, Rob 
House and escape—Murdered Man 
Relative of Thomas Dixon, of 
"Clansman”— Lynching Habit 
Threatens White Men. 


Winston-Salem, N. C., Dec. 14,— 
Armed posses today are pursuing 
two masked men who murdered 
Charles Dixon and his wife in their 


home at Fallston, Cleveland county. 
A lynching is sure to follow the cap¬ 
ture of the men. 

Dixon, who is a relative of Thomas 
Dixon, the auth6r-playwright, was 
called to his barn by masked men, 
who cut his throat. Returning to 
the house they cut Mrs. Dixoffis 
throat, and left her for dead. Then 
they ransacked the house, but found 
only $50. 

Mrs. Dixon was able to give an 
accurate description of the men be¬ 
fore she died. 


NEGROES BECOMING 
THRIFTY 

(Nashville Tennesseean:) Negro 
banks in the United States are 
increasing at a rapid rate. 

Altogether there are now fifty- 
seven Negro savings institutions 
in this country. 

Tennessee has four; Alabama, 
seven; Georgia, four; Mississippi, 
eleven; Virginia, seven; Texas, six; 
North Carolina, six; Florida, South 
Carolina and Maryland, one each; 
Oklahoma, two. 

Pennsylvania and Massachusetts 
have one Negro bank each, and 
Illinois has two, these being the 
only four in the North. 

Deposits in Negro banks aggre¬ 
gate $5,200,000 and their capital 
stock is $1,600,000. 

The first Negro bank was organ¬ 
ized at Richmond, Va., in 1888, 
and the second at Birmingham in 
1890.

THE LIBERATOR 


WANTS HEAVY DAMAGES 


DR. LUIS ENTERS SUIT AGAINST 
THE FOLLOWING PARTIES 


Drs. J. R. Sheppard, Pope Har- 
rald, G. W. Cole, Gasham Newman, 
Avenger Lee and Len Williams. 

Upon the trial and conviction of 
G. M. Newman in the county court 
recently, Drs. J. R. Sheppard, 
Harrald and Lee, pled guilty to the 
mobbing of Dr. R. T. Luis, a reput¬ 
able colored physician on the night 
of August 8th, in the Eight-mile 
bottom, east of Marshall. As an 
outcome of the mobbing and the 
result of the parties pleading guilty, 
Dr. Luis has asked in the District 
Court for $15,000. $5,000 actual 

and $10,000 exempliary damages 
—Marshall Daily Messenger, Dec. 
22, 1911. 

(All of the above parties are 
colored people. They have learned 
the white man’s trick of mobbing 
those whom he cannot otherwise 
overcome.) 


The Negro must take more ser¬ 
iously to heart the fact that he 
is compared to the whites, not 
making show enough. He has the 
education and the money and there¬ 
fore is without excuse for not do¬ 
ing more in the material world. 
Here in Dallas, he has more churches 
and schools than anything else. 
This is not true of the white man. 
He has more factories, stores, shops, 
and other bread-winning labor¬ 
using enterprises than churches 
and schools. He reasons that his 
off-spring must have a means of 
support—a way to get what is 
needed for earthly comfort before 
going into the heaven and hell 
business, and we are much of the 
opinion that the black man might 
profit by his example. Let us 
establish a few more enterprises 
which offer us a means of liveli¬ 
hood, for if we do not live we will 
not need anything in this world— 
and blame little in the world to 
come.—Dallas Express. 


RACE HATE ENDORSED 
BY REV. STOUT OF SANTA MON 
ICA 


Rev. J. A. Stout of Santa Monica 
spoke at the Forum last Sunday. On 
his notices printed beneath his 
cut lie announced himself as preach¬ 
er, elder, singer, lecturer, etc., etc., 
concluding with: “ He is undoubted¬ 
ly the most eloquent orator of the 
race.” Of course, meaning less 
verbiage like the above can always 
be depended upon to attract those 
creatures who talk when awake 
and think when they sleep. 

Mob Law Upheld 
Addressing his audience, Rev. 
Stout said among other things: 
“I am proud that the Negroes of 
the South are oppressed, hated 
and discriminated against because 
it makes business.” This state¬ 
ment cruel and un-Christian-like 
as it was was roundly applauded. 
Rev. Stout being a minister of 
the gospel ought to mean just 
what he says. Mob law with jim 
crowism and the nameless cata¬ 
logue of fiendish brutality that 
follows in its train, not only has 
not made business for Negroes, but 
has made none for the community 
that tolerated it. The fact that 
the Negro has accumulated millions 
of wealth in the South is not due 
to Southern oppression, but in 
spite of it, in spite of mob law, in¬ 
justice, cruel discrimination on ac¬ 
count of color, in spite of systematic 
robbery to which they have been 
subjected to by soulless planters 
and dishonest merchants. Southern 
Negroes own 53 banks, with a 
capital of more than a million dol¬ 
lars. Suppose the Negroes of the 
South had, had a square deal; 
if with everything against them they 
have accumulated millions could 
they have done more had the South 
given them a man’s show? Mob 
outrages, race discriminations and 
systematic injustice have not at 
any time or place made money for 
anybody. The man who believes 


and preaches such pernitious, bar¬ 
barous doctrine be he preacher or 
what not is a mighty poor adviser. 

That kind of pride is possibly the 
reason why Rev. Stout has made 
such a miserable failure at Santa 
Monica. And that’s why he can 
always draw a crowd at the 
“Fool’s Paradise.” A man who 
has to be kicked and cuffed around 
to make him provide for his family 
will never provide for them. The 
same is true of a race. The man 
who believes the contrary is not 
prepared to lead anybody or advise. 
If Rev. Stout believes what he 
says, he could quit preaching with¬ 
out doing the Golden Rule any 
harm, and his race can dispense 
with his advice without loss. 

WESLEY CHAPEL NOTES 


Rev. Mr. Fisher, assistant pastor 
of the Tabernacle M. E. Church, 
Pasadena, filled the pulpit Sunday 
morning. He preached a forceful 
sermon on tithing and aroused 
much interest in the way God 
would have the church supported. 
Without salary, Dr. Fisher is giv¬ 
ing his time to this work among 
the churches. He was followed 
by Col. Allensworth who closed the 
services with appropriate remarks. 

The memorial services held in 
honor of the late Rev. R. C. Bed¬ 
ford which took place in the evening, 
were attended by an unusually 
large audience, the entire city be¬ 
ing represented. The eulogy on 
the life and work of Rev. Bedford 
delivered by Attorney W. O. Tyler 
was in every way befitting to the 
occasion and subject. So eager 
was the audience to hear every 
word of the speaker that the falling 
of a pin would have been heard. 
It was an able address and had to 
be heard to be appreciated. 

In his five minute introductory 
remarks, Rev. Kenchin spoke vol¬ 
umes on the unending lives of those 
who live for the good of others. 
Mrs. Anna Owens sang a sweet 
solo. The exercises were impressive 
and entertaining throughout occu¬ 
pying front seats were members 
of the bereaved family. Mr. R. 
C. Owens presided.

THE LYCEUM 

The audience at The Lyceum last 
Sunday was not so large as the 
Sunday previous, but what it lacked 
in numbers was made vp in en¬ 
thusiasm. The discussion of cvr- 
rent topics occupied the time. 
The discussions were able and in¬ 
structive. Rev. W ade, Mrs. Snell 
and Messrs. Norris, McClellan and 
Snell, each made short addresses. 

The Lincoln-Douglas Day which 
will be celebrated next month will 
be made a grand affair. Prof.

A BIG INCREASE IN CIRCULA= 
T10N 

The January increase of The 
Liberator’s circulation is the largest 
in its history. The people are 
beginning to realize the value of 
the paper as never before, while 
the city leads all in new subscribers 
the suburban towns are coming 
up grandly, Pasadena and Santa 
Monica leading. The fact that our 
new subscribers are all volunteers 
is significant. 

The Liberator’s clean, able, fear¬ 
less policy is doing the business. 

The public man who don’t want 
his acts as such criticised will 
have to give up his job whether 
it’s office holding or preaching. 

If a preacher’s public utterances 
merit criticism they are going to 
get it. If any set of men ought to 
be guarded in what they say, it is 
the ministers of the gospel. The 
Deified men have all gone to 
heaven. 


Jack Johnson has agreed to 
fight Jim Flynn for a purse of 
$30,000. Now the white ministers 
who can witness all kinds of bru¬ 
tality and fiendish outrages by 
mobs without raising a hand, can 
get busy. In the prize ring the 
Negro has something of a man’s 
show; if mobs would give their 
Negro victims an animal’s consider¬ 
ation, these ministers would cry 
out against the mob law. 


WILL ADDRESS THE LYCEUM 

Attorney Edward Bi rton Ceruti, 
of New York, will address the Ly¬ 
ceum this Sunday, January 20th 
at 4 o’clock P. M. 

Everybody cordially invited.

A MAMMOTH EDITION COMING 


The twelfth anniversary edition 
of The Liberator will be published 
April 1st. It will be a mammoth 
edition and will contain hundreds 
of portraits of the leading colored 
men of the state. Ministers, law¬ 
yers, Doctors, Merchants and men 


who are making their marks in 
many callings. In men who have 
done things, California leads the 
Pacific Coast. Cuts of many of 
the splendid homes owned by the 
colored people will also appear. 
Churches, lodges, stores and offices 
of our business and professional 
men and women will testify as to 
the Negro’s splendid achievements 
in this wonderland of the great 
west. How a mere handful of 
colored people in this city grew to 
20,000 in 15 years, accumulating 
millions of wealth will be graphic¬ 
ally told. 

This mammoth -edition will be 
mailed to every part of the civi¬ 
lized world and will be a perpetual 
memorial of Negro achievement. 

A NEW FIRM 

On page six we publish the 
announcement of The People’s In¬

attention of our readers to the 
opportunities this firm offers them 
for safe as well as profitable invest¬ 
ment. The names of the officers 
and stockholders are a sufficient 
guarantee of the trustworthiness 
of the Company. 

Dr. Somerville the president, is 
a well known—and-popular young 
dentist whose success in his chosen 
profession eminently fits him to 
head the company. Mr. Eugene 
Walker is a member of the Chamber 
of Commerce with a first-class rating 
in Bradstreet and Dun. Dr. Lig¬ 
gett and other officers and members 
of the board of directors are so well 
known and popular that extended 
mention is unnecessary. The fact 
that the first 15.,000- shares placed 
on the market were sold in 15 days 
shows the confidence enjoyed by 
the company. A careful reading 
of the company’s announcement 
and an examination of the personnel 
of its officers and stock holders 
can but inspire confidence.

A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY PASS= 
ING 

The Linwood Acres Tract situated 
partly in the city of Watts and 
fifteen minutes ride from the busi¬ 
ness center of this city, offers the 
colored home-seeker the best oppor¬ 
tunity ever offered in this vicinity. 
The soil is unsurpassed in point of 
fertility adapted to the production 
of vegetables of every variety 
and can be grown -every month in 
the year.. One acre of this land 
planted to vegetables will furnish 
continuous employment at $50 to 
$75 per month for one able bodied 
man to make and market his crops. 
The truck farmer plants and gathers 
every day in the year and is the 
best paid farmer in the state. 
Owing to its situation, the Linwood 
truck gardner has at his door, 
market facilities second to none. 
Besides this city, the bay cities 
of Long Beach, Redondo Beach, 
Naples and Manhattan, furnish 
the truck gardner a ready market 
for everything produced. The 
Long Beach and Redondo electric 
lines furnish ten minute car service 
to the city or to the ocean. The 
famous automobile boulevard from 


the mountains to the sea, passes 
the tract. In short, Linwood is 
connected with this city and ocean 
by the best system of public roads 
in the country. If you want to 
become self-supporting and inde¬ 
pendent, buy an acre or more of 
land at Linwood. Price $1,200
