IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO 
DISFRANCHISE THE NEGRO? 


It would appear that the above 
query is far-fetched, considering 
the issues that brought the Republi¬ 
can Party into existence and made 
it the force that it is in National 
politics. “ This country cannot long 
exist,” said Lincoln, the patron 
saint of the Republican Party, 
“half slave and half free.” ’Twas 
the cause of freedom that made 
the party strong and. put it into 
power. The perpetuity of our 
Government lies in our being ab¬ 
solutely true to the democratic 
principle that underlies all our 
history and should underlie all 
our legislation—namely, all men 
are equal. It was the championing 
the cause of freedom and liberty 
that gave virility to the Republican 
Party and brought under its banner 
the voting strength of the Nation. 

The Democratic Party—certainly 
in the South—is a class organiza¬ 
tion open and above board. Its 
chief exponents to-day boldly de¬ 
clare against universal suffffrage- 
a declaration wholly at variance 
with the American ideal. But the 
disease is catching. Is the Repub¬ 
lican Party infected? Let us see. 
There is a complaint, in some 
quarters of the Grand Old Party, 
that Southern delegates figure all 
too largely in the selection of the 
Republican nominee for President. 
These Southern delegates help to 
nominate—it is claimed—but count 
very little in the election. Hence, 
the Grand Old Party says that 
Mississippi and Louisiana will not 
be permitted to vote in the National 
Republican Convention only in 
proportion to the local voting 
strength. 


At the recent meeting of the 
National Executive Committee the 
matter was brought forward and 
had considerable backing. Now, 
we are not interested in the question 
as a partisan; we are interested, 
however, in the moral phase of the 
question and interested as this 
scheme sanctions the wholesale 
disfranchisement propaganda that 
has been carried forward in the 
South so successfully. 

On the face of it, this proposition 
to equalize the votes in the Nation¬ 
al Convention on the basis of Re¬ 
publican votes seems eminently 
fair. But let i s not be too hasty 
in concluding, vftiy has not the 
Republican Party a larger vote in 
the South? Largely because Ne¬ 
groes are disfranchised and they 
are disfranchised, among other 
reasons, because they are Repub¬ 
licans. The Republican Party, 
therefore, cannot accept this new 
proposition without endorsing in 
toto the full program of the South 
in disfranchising loyal and patri¬ 
otic Negro citizens: 

At a recent meeting of the Re¬ 
publican National Executive Com¬ 
mittee, General Clay ton,, of Arkan¬ 
sas, opposed the change in the rule 
of apportionment, and based his 
objection primarily upon the in¬ 
justice which wo 1 . Id be inflicted 
upon the Negroes, not only of the 
South, but of the entire country by 
having the seal of approval placed 
upon their disfranchisement by 
Democratic legislators. He scored 
the “rank injustice of supplement¬ 
ing Democratic disfranchisement 
of American citizens in the South 
by corresponding disfranchisements 


in our conventions.” 

Continuing, General Clayton 
said: “In this connection, I am 
able to show in round numbers, 
based upon the census of 1910, 
the Negro population in some of 
our Northern and doubtful States— 
namely, Massachusetts, 28,000; 
Connecticut, 15,000; New York, 
134,000; New Jersey, 90,000; Penn¬ 
sylvania, 194,000; Ohio, 111,000; 
Indiana, 160,000; Illinois, 109,000; 
Missouri, 157,000; Kansas, 55,000; 
Mar viand, 232,000; total, about 
1,295,000. 

“The colored people of these 
and other States would be more 
than human if they did not resent 
at the polls such rank injustice, 
which, together with what their 
brothers in the South are endur¬ 
ing, would seem to justify them 
in making terms with the party 
into whose keeping their rights 
seem already to have been relegated. 

“The efforts to change the rule 
of apportionment do not appeal* 
to have originated with the Re¬ 
publican masses, nor even with 
the local conventions that appoint 
delegates, but with the delegates 
themselves. 

“ I am glad to see from newspaper 
announcements that Senator Boi rne 
or some of his friends, who may be 
delegates, contemplate the revival 
of this question in the next National 
Convention, in which case I hope 
the question will be thoroughly 
thrashed out and not confined to 
any five-minute rule, such as pre¬ 
vailed in the last, so that it may be 
finally settled, and whatever harm, 
if any, may have resulted from the 
close vote upon the proposition in

THE LIBERATOR 


the last convention may be com¬ 
pletely removed/' 

This squarely facing of the issue 
by General Clayton is thoroughly 
in harmony with his record for 
forty-five years touching the poli¬ 
tical rights of the Negro. The 
General and his family have stood 
bravely for the full manhood rights 
of the Negro. His voice in behalf 
of the Negro has rung out clearly, 
and there has never been any 
equivocation in his position with 
reference to these rights. 

It is well that the issue is up. 
It will be met. The Negro will 
meet it in or out of the party. May¬ 
be it is well to remind our friends 
that every Negro in the North has 
a cousin, or a brother, or an uncle, 
or a father, or a friend in the South. 
And a vote cast in New York by 
a Negro will be counted. Add to 
this the fact that the Democrats 
in New York have just made a 
Negro a deputy sheriff. And there 
is food for thought.—Southwestern 
Christian Advocate. 


WHITE MINISTER MAKES MOON 
SHINE WHISKEY 


Nashville, Tenn., Jan. 15.—The 
Rev. Joseph R. Smith of Sewanee 
was brought to Nashville today by 
Deputy United States Marshall 
W. A. Kilgore and Deputy Collector 
W. H. Tyler, after having been 
bound over to the April term of the 
federal court on a charge of making 
moonshine whiskey. At a pre¬ 
liminary hearing Saturday night 
Mr. Smith pleaded guilty to the 
charge. 

The minister has for several 
months been the regular pastor of 
three small churches near Sewanee. 
His “wild-act” still was located in 
the smoke-house a few yards from 
the parsonage and less than a quar¬ 
ter of a mile from his princia! 
church. The outfit destroyed by 
the officers was complete and nearly 
100 gallons of good beer and mash 
were found. 

The “wild-catting" parson was 
caught only after an all-night chase. 
He asserts he did not know it was a 
violation of the law to make 
whiskey, but knew it was wrong 


to drink it. He also stated he had 
never sold any of his whiskey 
but had given some of it to a few 
of his parishioners for medicinal 
purposes. 


THE LYCEUM 

The interest at the Lyceum last 
Sunday showed no abatement. The 
actions of the committee represent¬ 
ing the Lyceum which visited the 
Mayor to secure the appointment of 
a colored man on the censor board 
was endorsed by resolution. Attor¬ 
ney Paul M. Nash discussed at 
considerable length the nurse train¬ 
ing affair at the county hospital. 
He told of the work done, and to 
be done in order that justice may 
be had. His address threw much 
light upon the case and the deter¬ 
mination to fight it in the courts 
and at the ballot box was greatly 
intensified. 

Attorney Ceruti delivered a short 
but strong address. After which 
current topics were taken up and 
discussed in a manner that brought 
out much information. 


LINCOLN=DOUGLAS DAY 


The Lyceum will celebrate Feb. 
11th in honor of the birth days of 
Lincoln and Douglass which occur 
on the 12th and 14th of this month. 
Judge Henry C. Dillon will deliver 
the eulogy on the life of Lincoln 
and Prof. Jas. C. Moore will pay 
tribute to Frederick Douglass. 
These addresses will be followed by 
three minute speeches by capable 
persons. Music will be furnished 
by church choirs. There will be 
a number of instrumental and 
vocal solos. 

Everybody is invited and should 
show their appreciation of the 
services rendered humanity by 
those great Americans by being 
present. All seats free. Do your¬ 
self the honor to be present, 4. p. 
m., 1209 Central Ave. 


George Watkins a newspaper 
advertising representative of the 
S. P. Co. in Oakland was a visitor 
in our midst for a few days this 
week. 


MINOW DAY AT THE FOOL’S

every way trustworthy. 


DR. HILL TO PREACH SPECIAL 
SERMON 


Dr. J. T. Hill will preach a special 
sermon on “The Person and Office 
of the Holy Spirit.” Everybody 
cordially invited. Dr. Hill’s ser¬

instructive as he is a man well 
equipped intellectually and other¬ 
wise. 


The residence of Mrs. Foster, 
812 East 4th street, was the scene 
of an enjoyable luncheon on the 
27th. Those present were Madames 
Street, Carroll and Miss Morton. 
The evening was spent discussing 
people and incidents of other days.

WESLEY CHAPEL NOTES 


Rev. Jas. A. Warren conducted 
the services last Sunday in the 
absence of Rev. Kenchin. 

Sister Dollie Lewis preached a 
very impressive sermon at the 
close of which quite a number of 
people went to the altar for prayer. 

Singing by the choir and con¬ 
gregation seemed unusually fine. 


Rev. E. W. Kenchin who is 
filling Dr. Thomas’ place in the 
Parliaments “America for Christ” 
will speak in the Northern cities 
this week. He is one of the 
brightest young men in the M. E. 
Church and the coming great leader 
of the race in this country. 


MR. NOAH D. THOMPSON OF 
TUSKEGEE IS HERE 


It was our pleasure to meet 
Mr. Thompson this week for the 
first time, although he has been 
in the city for some months. He 
is a member of Tuskegee’s board 
of managers having charge of the 
advertising department and mana¬ 
ger of the student and publications 
at that famous school. While he 
admires the Angel City, he is still 
a Tuskegeean heart and soul. 


Mr. C. C. Flint’s campaign for'a 
seat in the city council two years 
hence is growing apace. His an¬ 
nouncement several weeks ago re- 
cieved the general approval of the 
colored voters. The colored voters 
will make a strong pull for repre¬ 
sentation in the next council. Re¬ 
presentation in the city council 
will put an end to the jim crow 
spirit that is being propagated 
here by the city and county offi¬ 
cials. There are thousands of lib¬ 
eral minded white voters who will 
help the colored voters in their 
fight for a square deal. Whitley 
got 40,000 votes—Flint can be 
elected. His election is a crying 
necessity.

A RARE CHANCE 

Linwoocl Acres offers the home 
seeker the best chance to be had 
in this vicinity. Just 15 minutes 
ride from the business center, 
ten minute car service. Rich land, 
plenty of water. An acre of that 
land with a five room cottage, costs 
less than the same cottage on a 
lot 50x150 feet in remote parts 
of the city with no better car 
service. Linwood is only a few 
blocks from schools and churches, 
second to none. Don’t imprison 
your children in a little city lot, 
when you can give them the free¬ 
dom of a country home in the 
freest, finest state on earth. If you 
want to see Linwood, ring u p Harry 
Mitchell, Main 4525. 

Mr. and Mrs. Paul Brown of 
Burlington Ave. were delightful 
host and hostess on Tuesday even¬ 
ing of this week when a small 
company of friends dropped in to 
spend a few pleasant hours. The 
evening was charmingly spent with 
music and conversation after which 
delicious refreshments were served. 

The Boyle Heights Pleasure 
Club gave a very charming affair 
on Wednesday evening last in the 
nature of a reception at he home 
of Mrs. C. M. Stokes, 3117 Clinton 
street. 

Mrs. Hattie Day was a delight¬ 
ful hostess on Sunday last when she 
entertained a company of six at 
a luncheon.

MR. Cu WALTER SNELL 


CHRISTOPHE 


We are pleased to acknowledge 
receipt of a copy of Christophe a 
Tragedy by Prof. W. E. Easton of 
this city. It is a well written, 
entertaining story dealing with the 
political history of Emperial Haiti. 
Prof. Easton deserves the success 
his book is meeting with. Already 
1,000 copies have been sold. 


The editor being one of the first 
to declare war against machine poli¬ 
tics in this city and state, and having 
assisted in its overthrow, we know 
of no individual who contributed 
more to the success of the reform 
movement among the colored voters 
than has Mr. G. Vi alter Snell. 
No one worked harder, suffered 
more, made greater sacrifices and 
received smaller consideration at 
the hands of the men who hold 
office by virtue of the sacrifices 
by Mr. Snell and his associates in 
a struggle that was waged fiercely 
for nearly ten years. 

So far as consideration is con¬ 
cerned none of the colored men 
who took up the Good Govern¬ 
ment’s fight among the colored 
voters have been thought of since 
the victory was won. On the 
contrary, the men who were identi¬ 
fied with the machine and who 
fought the reform movement bitter¬ 
ly at every stage of the struggle 
have been taken into the confi¬ 
dence of the men whose aspira¬ 


tions they struggled so hard to 
defeat. 


Draws the Color Line. 

But it is what the Negroes have 
lost in representation and prestige 
since the triumph of the reformers 
in this city and county that has 
well nigh destroyed confidence in 
the sincerity of the reform leaders 
The present city and county officers 
are the first to draw the color line 
when Negroes make application 
for positions that carry with them 
fair salaries and prestige. Under 
the Democratic administrations 
these same questions were raised 
by narrow minded job seekers 
only to be crushed by the officials. 
Now they are raised by the offi¬ 
cials as an excuse to avoid giving 
Negroes representation. For in¬ 
stance take that nurse training out¬ 
rage at the county hospital. Who 
is responsible for that disgusting 
appeal to race prejudice where no 
race prejudice previously existed? 
Who pay the expenses and run the 
































THE LIBERATOR 


FIVE 


county hospital—the nurses (em¬ 
ployees) or the tax paj^ers? Who 
ought to run it?. 


Governor Johnson Too. 

What is true of this city is equally 
true of the state; from Gov. John¬ 
son down the color line is being 
drawn. Mr. Snell was president 
of the first and only colored politi¬ 
cal organization in this state to 
endorse Gov. Johnson’s candidacy 
before the August primaries in 
1910. It was the only organiza¬ 
tion of the kind that supported 
him after the primaries. It was the 
influence of that organization and 
its supporters that gave Gov. John¬ 
son the colored vote of this city 
and county. In spite of the fact 
that fully nine-tenths of the colored 
votes received by the Gov. and 
his ticket came from this city and 
county, the Negroes of this section 
of the state have received no con¬ 
sideration whatever. In fact they 
haven’t heard a word from the 
Governor since the election more 
than a year ago. 

The machine may have had its 
faults, but drawing the color line 


on its Negro supporters was not 
one of them. 


CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS 
DRAWING THE COLOR LINE 


Under the sub-head “ Draws the 
Color Line,” w r e call the attention 
of our readers to the methods the 
city and county officials are pur¬ 
suing to avoid giving the Negroes 
a square deal. The loyalty of 
this journal to the Good Government 
cause cannot be questioned. It is 
the insincerity of the officials who 
are expected to put its policies 
into execution that this journal 
is taking to task. Regardless of 
its pretentions, no government is 
good that recognizes race, color 
or condition in the enforcement 
of its laws or in the bestowal of 
its opportunities. 

If the Negro cannot get a man’s 
treatment in the so-called Good 
Government party, then his place 
is in some other party. 


FIFTY FOR THE WEEK 


50 new subscribers is the record 
r the week just closed. This 


unprecedented increase in The 
Liberator's circulation is due very 
largely to the fearless manner with 
which it attacks those whose words 
or acts are detrimental to the 
progress of the race, There are 
none too big to escape the criticism 
of this journal if they merit it, and 
none too small to receive its com¬ 
mendation for things well done. 

The Liberator is a newspaper 
published in the interest of all the 
people, for the good of all the 
people and no man big or little 
will escape an overhauling when 
his acts become a menace to the 
public. 

For the time being The Liberator 
is harpooning whales. 


Paul Williams a talented young 
man and a student in one of our
