THE LIBERATOR. 


Colored Lawyers Win 
-Victory. 

jrsr crow cars knocked out. 

Judge R. M. Call of Jacksonville, 
Fla., handed down a decision declaring 
the Jim Crow, street car law recently 
enacted in that state, unconstituitonal. 
The law provides that Negro servants 
may ride in the compartment set aside 
for white people. This, the judge de¬ 
clares, is class legislation. 

If we are not mistaken, every Jim 
Crow car law in this country contains 
the same provision. The people who 
demand this class of legislation have no 
objection whatever to the Negro as a 
servant | it is only as an educated lady 
or gentleman that they hate him. All 
Jim Crow legislation in this country is 
class legislation, because the Federal 
Constitution knows neither race nor 
color, and any law enacted compelling 
the races to sit or ride separately on 
common carriers is class legislation. 
This is too well known to admit of com¬ 
ment. The case was conducted by 
Messrs. Wetmore and Purcell, colored 
attorneys. They hired a colored man 
to board a street car and take a seat in 
the compartment set apart for white 
people. He was promptly arrested and 
lodged in jail. The attorneys took out 
a writ of habeas corpus and paid the 
prisoner for each day he remained in 
jail pending the decision. The writ was 
sustained and the prisoner discharged. 
The loyal colored citizens of Jackson¬ 
ville presented the attorneys with $150. 
They will carry the case to the United 
States Supreme Court if the Florida 
Supreme Court reverses the decision of 
the lower court. It is sincerely hoped 
.that the Florida Supreme Court will go 
on record for simple justice and fair 
play. God forbid that the case ever 
reach the United States Supreme Court, 
for that body of Republican lawyers 
are almost as anti-Negro^ as is Gov. 
Vardaman. Should the case reach that 
court and secure a decision in favor 
of honesty and justice, the whole infa¬ 
mous Jim Crow car legislation would 
be knocked out. This is not very lia¬ 
ble to happen. 

The white papers of Jacksonville say 
k that"the boycott against the street cars 
instituted by the colored people was the 
most successful ever witnessed in any 
city. 


The whole negro population simply 
kept away from the cars. The street 
car companies were so anxious to get 
the Negroes back on their cars that they 
ripped out the partitions separating the 
races on the same day that the decision 
was handed down. The colored people 
of Jacksonville deserve the gratitude of 
the Negroes of the entire country. As 
soon as the Negroes learn to make the 
fight for their rights a common cause, 
the class legislation that disgraces the 
statute books of so many of the states 
will find a resting place in hell with 
slavery and its friends and beneficiaries. 
Messrs. Wetmore and Purcell are ren¬ 
dering a great service to the race in 
Florida and the country as well. They 
should be well supported financially and 
otherwise. 


ONE BY ONE THE ROSES FALL. 

When Hon.(.?) Wm. Strother pleaded 
guilty a few days ago to stealing a stock¬ 
ing and $12 from a struggling woman 
who had him employed, a lovely rose 
fell from that cluster of wife beaters 
and grafters who run the Afro-Ameri¬ 
can Council. The facts in the case are 
these: Hon. (?) Wm. Strother runs 
an express wagon in Pasadena. A hard¬ 
working woman hired him to move her 
household goods. Among her effects 
was an old stocking and $12. 

It seems that everything was safely 
delivered except the articles, mentioned, 
which were finally located in Strothers’ 
pocket by an officer. Fie was arraigned 
and as a good and true Afro-American 
Council office holder he pleaded guilty 
and was sentenced to pay a fine of $25 
or serve 25 days on the chain gang. 
Being unable to pay the fine, it was 
promptly paid by a few prominent col¬ 
ored men of that city. 

The whole thing was wrong and scan¬ 
dalous. President Roosevelt, the friend 
of humanity, has said that the Negro 
who commits a crime and the Negro or 
Negroes who aid him in escaping the 
full penalty of the law are the worst en¬ 
emies of the Negro race. Fie says 
farther that while friends may aid the 
Negro in his struggles to-lift himself to 
a higher plane, the Negro can do more 
for himself than any one else. 

If Strother had gone to the chain 
gang a wholesome lesson would have 
been taught his kind, and the Negroes 
of fair Pasadena would not have as¬ 
sumed the atittude of standing in with 


petty thieves. Shall the oft-repeated 
insinuation that “all Negroes are the 
same” be made good? Shall the charge 
that the commission of crime does not 
lower the Negro’s social status among 
themselves be proven true? 

Those wife beaters and grafters who 
run the Council cannot stultify them¬ 
selves by asking Strother to resign. As 
there will be nothing in the treasury to 
steal, any old thief can safely hold down 
the job. 


WILL FIGHT EVERY PROPOSI¬ 
TION. 

It has been given out by the grafters 
who run the Afro-American League that 
they and their friends and sympathizers 
are to fight every proposition that The 
Liberator or its editor stands for or en¬ 
dorses. There is nothing new about 
this. They have been doing that ever 
since 1896, and have been about as suc¬ 
cessful as the silly billy goat that butted 
off his head against a stone wall. After 
the wall would not go his way. After 
helping to carry this state for McKinley 
in 1896, we undertook th e her culean task 
of'dividing the Negro vote of this city 
and state, so as to out them in a position 
to ' get a respectable share of political 
spoils secured with the aid of their 
votes. This the gang fought with all 
of the bitterness and personal abuse that 
it could command, but to no avail, for 
so successful was our fight that an in¬ 
dependent club was organized and helped 
to elect Hon. M. P. Snyder Mayor of 
this city, and not one colored voter ever 
regretted voting for him, although he 
is a Democrat. As a result of that and 
subsequent victories, the colored voters 
have not only secured a half dozen po¬ 
licemen and enough firemen to form a 
company, but have been raised in the 
estimation of their fellow citizens an 
hundred fold. 

Following up our victory in 1898 with 
the aid of C. C. Flint, that brave and 
matchless champion of race elevation, 
and others of his kind, we put a column 
of intelligent, brave, young black race 
patriots in a Democratic parade and so 
frightened the Republican leaders that 
they pledged themselves to give the col¬ 
ored voters representation on the state’s 
clerical force and to_.no longer regard 
cuspidor cleaning as a reward for po¬ 
litical service. That being the cause of 
our bolt, Hon. Henry T. Gage was elect¬ 
ed and gave the Negroes a clerkship 






























on the Board of Harbor Commissioners 
in the person of Attorney G. Woodson 
Wickliffe, who is a credit not only to 
his race, but to the Board. This op¬ 
ened the way for the appointment of 
Editor T. A. Greene and Capt. F: H. 
Crumbly to clerkships in the State Leg¬ 
islature. We mapped out these plans 
in 1896 while these knockers were graft¬ 
ing and holding up candidates for of¬ 
fice; and we have carried them to a suc¬ 
cessful conclusion, although while en¬ 
gaging the enemy in front, we had to 
beat back the traitors who hung ever 
on our rear and hang on the rear of 
every proposition that has for its object 
the stimulation of honesty, integrity, in¬ 
dustry and manly courage among our 
people 

Apropos: the editor’s fight to divide 
the Negro vote has been so success¬ 
ful that more negroes voted for the 
Democratic candidate for Mayor in the 
municipal campaign of 1904 than voted 
for the Republican candidate. And John 
Jasper Neimore, that exemplary (?) 
family man and embodiment of political 
and civic virtue, not only supported 
Hon. LeCompte Davis, a Democrat, for 
Senator, against Senator Pendleton, the 
Republican nominee, but supported the 
Democratic candidate for Mayor last 
fall against the Republican nominee, and 
while supporting the Republican candi¬ 
date for City Treasurer got Uncle Billy 
Workman’s cut and secured, or tried to 
secure, $10 from him under the pretense 
of whooping him up in the Eagle, which 
he had no idea of doing. If they can 
get any more pleasure out of fighting 
The Liberator’s propositions in the fu¬ 
ture than they have in the past they are 
welcome to it. While the gang were 
fighting The Liberator and its editor he 
has gone right along mapping out plans 
and executing them for the material and 
political advancement of our people, 
virtually “turning everything he touched 
into gold,” and every black man asso¬ 
ciated with him in his struggles for race 
advancement is today successfully em¬ 
ploying himself and others, while the 
gang who fought him and the things for 
which he stood are either dependent up¬ 
on some one for employment or are sub¬ 
sisting by grafting. All those who are 
in sympathy with and want to follow 
these wife beaters and political mounta- 
banks are at liberty to do so. “Men 
are sometimes judged by the company 
they keep.” 


THE LIBERATOR. 

PERSONAL MENTION. 

Attorney G. Woodson Wickliffe of the 
Harbor Commission of San Francisco 
was shaking hands with his old friends 
in this city and vicinity a few days ago. 
It is needless to say that everybody was 
glad to see him. For many years he 
practiced law here and was regarded by 
the bench as one of the best equipped 
young attorneys at the bar. Mr. Wick¬ 
liffe honored the Edmonds villa with a 
visit. We sincerely regret that we were 
absent and did not have the pleasure of 
taking him for a drive around Sawtelle 
and its beautiful environments. 

* * * 

Mr. H. A. Iiarroll, a wealthy rancher 
and solid citizen of Craftonville, Cal., 
was a welcome visitor to the city this 
month. He is a liberal supporter of 
race enterprises, and while here gave 
$50 to the building fund of the Wesley 
Chapel M. E. Church. He also added 
one dollar to The Liberator’s fund. Fie 
has been a friend and supporter of it 
since its first appearance. 

* sk * 

Mr. J. B. Wilson of Oakland, Cal., 
formerly editor of the Elevator, was a 
delegate to the congress of leg pullers 
held in Pasadena on the 8th. What in¬ 
duced a good fellow like Wilson to 
waste his time and journey 500 miles 
to mix up with a faking concern that 
enjoys only the contempt of the business 
and professional men and women of this 
city is to some a mystery. But Wilson 
has an eye to business, or thinks so. 
He has been “doin’ politics” for lo these 
many years, and except a few shekels 
picked up here and there during cam¬ 
paigns, all he ever got out of the busi¬ 
ness was a job of dusting hats and hold¬ 
ing overcoats for members of the Leg¬ 
islature, sweeping ante-rooms and clean¬ 
ing cuspidors just to kill time while 
posing as a successful black politician. 
Since, through the fight of The Liber¬ 
ator and its friends, the Negroes are 
receiving clerkships as political rewards, 
word has gone north that the whole 
thing was brought about by a myster¬ 
ious talisman held by the president of 
the Afro-American Council, better 
known as the Afro-American Leg Pull¬ 
ers, and all of the old broken-down 
politicians of the north who desire to 
renew their pull are ordered to make 
a pilgrimage to the south and and do 
homage to this latter-day soothsayer, 
whose hind pocket is just bulging with 


3 

clerkships to be given the faithful. The 
truth of the matter is, that if the gang 
had known that the gentlemen now 
holding clerkships were candidates for 
the positions they hold, the gang would 
have fought them to a finish, as they 
have fought every black man that pos¬ 
sessed either character or ability. Wil¬ 
son’s ambition is a laudable one, but 
a rude shock awaits him. 

>k 3|c * 

Editor Harbot of the Colored Citizen, 
of Riverside, was with the whoopers-up 
at the leg pullers’ convention. Editor 
Harbot is a race man ana a good man, 
but if he expects to do his race, him¬ 
self or paper any good, “he is barking 
up the wrong tree.” This he will dis¬ 
cover later on. 

3k Jk * 

By the way, there were several other 
pilgrims who have lost their pull in the 
north and made the pilgrimage to the 
leg pullers’ convention to get a legis¬ 
lative clerkship. 


THE TIMES AND AFRO-AMERI¬ 
CAN CONGRESS. 

The daily papers in general, and the 
Times especially, have the thanks of the 
decent element of the colored citizens 
for the manner in which they treated 
the Afro-American Congress. The fail¬ 
ure of the daily papers to publish the 
proceedings of the so-called congress, 
the fakers running it lost the free ad¬ 
vertising that has furnished their prin¬ 
cipal source of revenue—that enabled 
them to hold up candidates for office, 
beat the public out of money under the 
pretense that it was to be used to enter¬ 
tain the so-called congress or some other 
scheme. Believing that it was helping 
the race. The Times has been very 
generous in reporting the proceedings of 
the race’s conventions; but on finding 
that the League has fallen into the hands 
of a shameless set of black grafters and 
has not the support of the decent ele¬ 
ment, The Times, which has done so 
much to exterminate white grafters, has 
decided not to increase the business of 
black ones by advertising them. 

The action of the papers in this mat¬ 
ter meets with the approval of every de¬ 
cent race-loving Negro in this city. We 
doff our hat to you, gentlemen, in the 
fight we are trying to make for the ele¬ 
vation of our race. You can aid us 
very materially.

THE FORUM DELEGATION 
MAKES REPORT. 

The report of the delegation who tried 
to represent the Forum at the Afro- 
American Congress proved it to be just 
the failure that The Liberator predicted. 
Rev. Edwards sorrowfully said that the 
congress was not noticed by the daily 
papers. He deplored the fact that the 
business and professional men and oth¬ 
ers whose presence would have lent dig¬ 
nity and importance to the convention 
were conspicuous for their absence. In 
short, he said the whole business was 
a miserable failure and a reflection up¬ 
on the Negro’s intelligence, or words to 
that effect. Mr. E. O. Brokens said he 
did not attend, as he was informed by 
those who attended the first session that 
it was no place for a gentleman, and 
he being one, deemed it unsafe to at¬ 
tend. Mr. Norris said he went over 
and found it a cut and dried proposi¬ 
tion to keep the decent element out, so 
he returned to his business. Mr. G. W. 
Dennis Jr., who also tried to represent 
the California Investment Co., de¬ 
nounced the congress as a disgrace and 
a reflection upon the manhood of the 


Negroes of California. Dr. T. J, Nel-- 
son paid his respects to the “rabbit 
foot” superstitious element that domi¬ 
nated the congress, to the exclusion of 
the better class. The Doctor handled 
them roughly. The job of defending the 
gang was left to Mr. Theodore Troy, 
proprietor of the Forum and joint own¬ 
er, defender, mouthpiece and general ad¬ 
vocate of the wife-beating petty thieves 
that run the council. He was the only 
person that had the hardihood to defend 
them. He admitted that the gang was 
weak and crooked; for the aforesaid 
reason he helped to keep it in power. He 
said he thought by watching them they 
might be kept straight. Some men pos¬ 
sess a strang mental deformity over 
which they have no control, and for 
which they are not to blame. Such men 
have more confidence in crooked men 
than - they have in straight ones; and 
have more respect for ignorance and 
venality than for intelligence and virtue. 
Encumbered by such a mental outfit, 
their defense of the wrong should not 
be taken seriously—they have not the 
power to do otherwise. 


IS IT POSSIBLE? 

It is reported by the Associated Press 
that the Negro Baptist State Convention 
of Texas endorsed the brutal burning of 
the mulatto, Tom Williams, charged 
with attempted rape on a white woman. 
We cannot construe the failure of the 
convention to pass a resolution condemn¬ 
ing that outrage as an endorsement. If 
that convention had passed a resolution 
condemning that crime, not one of those 
taking part in it could have returned to 
his home or church. No one knows this 
better than the members of that body. 
Unless that convention could have con¬ 
demned that crime, the matter should 
never have been broached. The Negroes 
canont afford to endorse crime, no mat¬ 
ter by whom it is committed. The Ne¬ 
gro minister who endorses burning at 
the stake, or any form of mob law, is a 
disgrace to the religion he pretends to 
preach, a traitor to his country, to his 
race, and to the mother that bore him. 
Rape is a heinous crime and deserves 
the severest punishment known to the 
law. Mob law is a crime. Mob mur¬ 
ders are just as much a violation of the 
law as other murders, and should be 
punished as such. The burning of a 
human being at the stake is the most 
brutal crime in the calendar of crime. 


f Williams was guilty, he was a brute 
too mean to live, and the mob that 
burned him at the stake and those wit¬ 
nessing it were as brutal, if not more 
so, than he. 

Only a few weeks before a white brute 
raped his own 13-year-old daughter in 
Texas (the. same state), the complaint 
against the brute being sworn to by both 
mother and daughter. The story of his 
Ciime was briefly told in the Associated 
Press dispatches and was printed in ob¬ 
scure corners of the daily papers. And 
although his guilt has been clearly es¬ 
tablished, he has not been lynched; there 
is no thought of burning him at the 
stake. It is the color of the criminal 
and not the crime that insenses the mob. 
If the rape fiend is white and his victim 
white, he is given a chance to leave the 
country and the crime is hushed no, If 
his victim is a Negro girl, he is never 
arrested. 

Lynching has been declared a viola¬ 
tion of the Federal Constitution, and the 
sooner the government begins hanging 
lynchers, the better it will be for all 
concerned. Either the lynchers or the 
government will have to go. Those 
Negro ministers ought to be driven from 
the pulpit. 


MR. PRINCE PLEADS FOR JUS¬ 
TICE, NOT MERCY, 

Mr. J. L. Edmonds, 

Sawtelle, Cal. 

Sir:—I notice in The Liberator you 
have just mailed to me, you have insin¬ 
uated that I induced Mr. Jas. Alexan¬ 
der to.go before the City Council to in¬ 
duce them to appropriate money to en¬ 
tertain the congress. I wish to say that 
I have not authorized any one to solicit 
money for the congress; neither am I a 
party to such a proposition. I knew 
nothing about it until Messrs. Blair 
and Greene spoke about it, and onl> 
saw the article as copied by you and 
as you referred to it. I do not write this 
note as pleading for mercy, but for fear 
you have been misinformed. In the first 
place I have no authorty to solicit from 
outsiders to help us. We have gotten 
along without it. Yours resoectfully, 
WM. PRINCE. 

The above from Mr. Prince sneaks for 
itself, and it has been shown by investi¬ 
gation that the attempt to raid the city 
treasury by certain officers of the Afro- 
American Council was made without the 
















THE LIBERATOR. 


B 


knowledge of many of the officers. At¬ 
torney Blair, the council’s attorney, was 
not consulted, and knew nothing of the 
matter until it was publshed in the pa¬ 
pers. Mr. Warner was not consulted 
and knew nothing of the matter. Messrs. 
Blair, Prince and Warner were state of¬ 
ficers and members of the cabinet. Mr. 
Blair being the attorney, it was his 
business to draw up all petitions. But 
that was a petition that the boys did not 
want Blair to see. How many petitions 
that have been successfully floated that 
Blair has not seen, the Lord only knows. 

The Liberator’s defense of the people 
against the grafters has made them very 
restive, and they are breathing out 
threats on every hand that the editor is 
to be beaten into a jelly bag. A plot 
was made to carry out the threat at a 
meeting held at the Second Baptist 
Church on the night of August 7th, but 
when he put in an appearance it was 
decided that the time was not oppor¬ 
tune, as the best time to whip some men 
is when they are absent. What they say 
or do about the editor gives him no 
concern whatever. Personally, the gang 
has his sympathy and will have his aid 
whenever they decide to lead such lives 
as will meet the approval of their sainted 
dead mothers. 


JAKIE REMEMBERS THE CLUB. 

I hrough the kind remembrance of our 
old friend, Jakie Berhent, each member 
of the Cosmopolitan Club has received 
a big chunk of gold ore, dug out of 
Jakie’s gold mine at Goldfield. The fact 
that Jakie dug the ore himself adds very 
largely to its value, as he was the soul 
of the club when here. Jakie will ac¬ 
cept the thanks of the club, as well as 
ourselves, for this token of remem¬ 
brance. On hearing of the success of 
Jakie and Mac, the club held a jollifica¬ 
tion meeting at which the chunks of ore 
he sent were exhibited. His letter was 
read, and while the tipling members 
drank to his success, the prohibs shout¬ 
ed for Mac's victory over rum, and both 
were congratulated for the big strike 
they had made. By indulging in little 
reminiscences it was found that every 
member of the club that has migrated 
from the city has succeeded in getting 
hold of the world’s goods beyond all ex¬ 
pectation, and the club’s entire member¬ 
ship has achieved success. A few years 
ago the present head of the club was 
working by the day in a printing estab¬ 
lishment. He is now head of one of 


the most prosperous printing houses in 
the city. One member opened a rubber 
stamp outfit in one corner of a job print¬ 
ing office also carrying stationery 
and magazines. He now occupies an 
entire store. One member, who was a 
struggling newspaper man, married a 
wealthy and handsome widow, since 
which time he has been so busy perform¬ 
ing domestic duties and basking in the 
sunshine of his good lady’s smiles that 
he rarely ever visits the club. He is a 
good fellow and sympathizes with the 
club. But bis lucky marriage lifted him 
to a social set among whom the club 
has very few acquaintances. 

I he cases mentioned above are sim¬ 
ply samples of the club members’ gen¬ 
eral prosperity. It is a case where all 
have gone forward and none backward. 
Jakie leads the band in rapid financial 
success, while Mac leads all in moral 
success, from the fact that he has gone 
dry. Ihe boys should not forget to come 
down occasionally and take a bath where 
water is cheaper than rum. And Mac 
should go to church sober so as to guard 
against throwing the wrong coin into the 
collection! 


IN BUSINESS CIRCLES. 

Miss Daisy Andrews^has an up-to- 
date millinery establishment at 776 Wall 
street. She is a bright young business 
woman who deserves the support of our 
people. Too much cannot be done for 
young ladies like her. Let every fam¬ 
ily buy at least one hat from her. 

* * * 

The Brown Manufacturing Company, 
manufacturers of Brown’s celery phos¬ 
phates and other specialties, now occupy 
their own building and are on the road 
to the success they deserve. 

* * * 

The Crystal Pressing Club, Messrs. J. 
E. Scott and Ed W. Walker, proprietors, 
are succeeding nicely. They are very 
largely patronized by our young men, 
with whom they are popular. 


The undertaking establishment of Por¬ 
ter & Roberts is an enterprise well wor¬ 
thy of the support of the race. The suc¬ 
cess of these ventures means increased 
employment for the race. None of the 
white establishments employ colored 
help so far as we can learn.

Mr. W. H. Walker has opened a new 
tailoring business at 445 Central ave¬ 


nue. He is a first-class workman and is 
crowded with work. 

A WEEK’S RALLY. 

The week’s Carnival at the new Wesley 
Chapel M. E. Church, corner of Eighth 
and San Julian streets, begins Monday, 
September 4th, in the social hall of the 
new church, and ends September 10th. 
The Carnival begins Monday, Septem¬ 
ber 4th, following the great entrance 
day, which is Sunday, September 3rd. 
The great rally day is September 10th. 


The California Investment Company, 
of which C. C. Flint is president, is 
making splendid headway. The capital 
stock, $25,000, is divided into 25,000 
shares of $1 each, and is selling rapidly. 
Its officers and directors are worthy and 
capable men who enjoy the confidence 
of the people. 


SAWTELLE HAPPENINGS. 

The battle for incorporation was lost 
The antis, dubbed the Lime Kiln Club, 
earned everything before them. The 
threatened exodus from the town if in¬ 
corporation did not carry, has not ma¬ 
terialized. Everything has assumed its 
normal condition and building operations 
and street grading goes merrily on. 
For the past six weeks the farmers have 
enjoyed a season of unprecedented pros¬ 
perity and all hands have been busy har¬ 
vesting and selling vegetables, which are 
not only the best on the market, but 
bring the highest prices.

Mr. and Mrs. Mason Reed have re¬ 
moved to their new home in Santa Mon¬ 
ica. Their cottage, which is on Seventh 
street, two doors from the car line, is 
a landmark. It is not only the most 
beautiful of a beautiful group of cot¬ 
tages, but has the most tastily finished 
interior we have seen. It is modern in 
every way.

LET MEN UNITE. 

The big fish eat the little ones, 

The larger sncompass the small; 

Wherever we look we see thepower 

Which the greater exert for the 
lesser to fall. 

The lesson it teaches is that men 
should unite, 

Both inbody and mind for help and 
protection; 

Fo r many in one is a power in pro¬ 
portion, 

As numbers increase their strength 
by collection. 

So if men would unite in their labor 
and store, 

Combine all their wisdom for their 
mutual good; 

Help one another to supply all their 
needs, 

Then all would have plenty, none 
lacking in food.

THAT SQUARE DEAL. 

That square deal the President 
promised to the country has been 
lived up to in every particular with 
the exception of cutting down South¬ 
ern representation; on this proposi¬ 
tion he shows a disposition to cater to 
Smithern sentiment. This plank in 
the platform upon which the President 
was overwhelmingly elected was too 
plain to be misunderstood. The peo¬ 
ple did not vote blindly——ey under- 
stod the platform and indorsed it in 
no uncertain terms. If the President 
is seeking immortality he will not get 
it by uniting the North and South at 
the sacrifice of manhood rights. If the 
President would pursue a policy that 
would secure to every American citi¬ 
zen the full enjoyment of his consti¬ 
tutional rights, and let the Philippines 
go, he would not only immortalize him¬ 
self but would save the shedding of 
rivers of blood and inaugurate a na¬ 
tional career that would add thousands 
of years to the nation’s life.
