THE Llb^AlUrv. 


The President’s Position Endorsed 

[by direct wire to the times.] 

New York, Aug. 4 .— Exclusive Dis¬ 
patch. The World (Dem.) says: 

“The West Virginia Democratic State 
convention yesterday honored itself in 
refusing by an overwhelming vote to 
add the 'white man's government’ plank 
to the state platform. The World must 
disapprove the determination evinced in 
many Southern states to inject the race 
issue into the national campaign. The 
claim that this is a ‘white man’s coun¬ 
try’ or ‘white man's government’ is a 
denial of the Declaration of Independ¬ 
ence and a challenge to the Constitu¬ 
tion. 

“The government or party which 
would take in a Georgia ‘cracker,’ the 
poor white of other states, the members 
of the ‘mountain vendetta,’ the Balti¬ 
more plug ugly/ the Chicago ‘hobo’ and 
the New York ‘tough,’ because they 
are white, and exclude Booker T. 
Washington because he is black, is not 
Democratic, whatever it may be. 

This is not a ’white man’s country/ 
save in the sense that white men are in 
a vast majority, and therefore will con¬ 
tinue to rule it. But that majority 
will never assent to the doctrine, born 
of the Stultifying and blighting insti¬ 
tution of slavery, now happily forty 
years dead, that the man who is good 
enough to produce wealth and pay taxes 
and fight and die for his country is not 
fit to have a voice in its government un¬ 
der any condition whatever, if he is 
black. 

There need be no delusions in any 
portion of the South on this question.” 


THE SOUTH EDUCATING 
NEGROES. 

The Southern people have been mak¬ 
ing a great bluff about spending mil¬ 
lions of dollars to educate the Afro- 
Americans. There’s nothing in the 
stories they tell. Last week the Georgia 
legislature, with a great flourish of 
trumpets, appropriated $4,000 for the 
Georgia State Industrial College near 
Savannah. In the discussion of the 
bill the fact came out that the State of 
Georgia has never made an appropria¬ 
tion for this school, although it is known 
as a state institution. The United 
States government gives Georgia $24,000 
annually for agriculturad education on 
condition that $ 8,000 go to the educa^ 


tion of Afro-Americans. For three 
years the state has withheld the appro¬ 
priation for the industrial school, thus 
buncoing its Afro-American citizens out 
of $24,000. This year it was stated 
that unless the appropriation for the 
colored school was made that the United 
States would refuse to pay the $24,000. 
The Georgia solons saw the point and 
the bill giving the Afro-Americans their 
share was passed without a dissenting 
vote.—Exchange. 

For every dollar earned by Southern 
white men that has been appropriated 
for the education of negroes, nine dol¬ 
lars earned by negroes have been ap¬ 
propriated for the education of white 
youths in the South. The negroes of 
that section produce nine-tenths of the 
wealth, and therefor pay nine-tenths of 
the cost of running its public institu¬ 
tions. Those whose labor produces 
wealth of a community pay its taxes, 
whether they own the property or not. 
By class legislation, mobs, peonage and 
systematic robbery, the great body of 
laboring blacks of the South are kept 
in abject poverty and dense ignorance. 


INSULTS THE PRESIDENT’S 
MOTHER. 

All of the decent people in the coun¬ 
try sustain Postmaster General Payne 
in his refusal to bestow the name of 
Vardaman on a postoffice in the state 
of Mississippi. The man Vardaman, 
who by grace of a race hatred cam¬ 
paign is now governor of Mississippi, 
is the owner and editor of a newspa¬ 
per which published an infamous article 
reflecting on the mother of the President 
of the United States.— Exchange. 

The brutal assault upon the good 
name of the President’s mother by Gov¬ 
ernor Vardaman is a surprise to no one 
who has read in the newspapers of the 
country his cowardly attacks upon the 
innocent defenseless negroes of his be¬ 
nighted state. Vardaman, who has 
made a business of insulting negro wo¬ 
men because they are black, has now 
turned upon white women. The cow¬ 
ard, be he white or black, who will in¬ 
sult a negro woman because she is black 
or cannot defend herself, will insult a 
white woman if he thinks he can escape 
the punishment his brutality deserves. 
If President Roosevelt was a private 
citizen, Vardaman would ram his head 
in the fire rather than make the remarks 


with which he stands charged. With 
a man like Vardaman for governor, a 
man who wantonly and brutally insults 
a woman because she gave to her coun¬ 
try as ruler a clean, strong, manly man, 
the fact that a thousand white men in 
Mississippi, the state of which Varda¬ 
man is governor, burned an innocent 
colored woman at the stake in front 
of a Christian church simply because 
she was a negro, should have occasioned 
no surprise. 

If the Postmaster General had con¬ 
sented to naming the Mississippi post- 
office Vardaman, as soon as Vardaman’s 
supporters in Mississippi became civ¬ 
ilized they would have changed its 
name. The white people of this coun¬ 
try will yet come to their senses. The 
Tillmans and Vardanians will make 
lots of trouble for this country.

Aftr Faston’s Scalp 

Pandemonium reigned at the Roose¬ 
velt Republican Club (colored) a few 
nights ago. The fight to “unhoss” 
President Easton was something fierce. 
There were “pints” of order by the bar¬ 
rel, rising to questions of “personal” 
privileges, yells and wild jesticulations. 
this with awful concussions caused by 
the pounding of the president’s maid 
upon the Uble, made an uproar resemb¬ 
ling a Japanese charge punctuated by 
artillery. The “charman,” who looked 
like a mauling machine by his contin¬ 
ual pounding, fearing that persons in 
the neighborhood in need of sleep and 
re^t might turn on the riot alarm, arose 
with a go-as-you-can-movement like a 
butterfly in a whirl wind, his hair stand¬ 
ing on ends, his standing-collar totally 
wrecked by a flood of perspiration, offer¬ 
ed his resignation. Instantly there 
was a great calm and what a few mo¬ 
ments before had all of the appear¬ 
ance of a Democratic convention in ses¬ 
sion, was now as serene as a resting 
sea. 

The Eaglemnff who had spent the 
earlier hours of the night in foraging 
and who by the way is thought to be the 
“nigger in the woodpile/' entered the 
hall just in time to hear the tidings of 
joy that president’s resignation con¬ 
veyed. But his hopes of capturing the job 
were doomed to be rudely shattered. 
Holding a hurried consultation with his 
former cohorts, he found to his con¬ 
sternation that every mother’s son in the

club was a candidate except the Enter¬ 
prise man who, keeping a sharp look¬ 
out, occupied a seat nearest the door to 
facilitate his flight in event of a horn 
match between Mr. Luke and another 
Texas steer. It was found impossible 
to elect a new president owing to the 
fact that each member of the club voted 
for himself. No amount of eloquence 
or oratory could secure for a candidate 
more than one vote—each member re¬ 
ceiving just one vote. The attempt to 
reason with them was like whistling to 
stop a fire. This thing of voting for 
one’s self originated with the Eagle- 
man, who it is said voted for himself at 
the late Republican primaries. The 
fact that he got onlyone vote in the en¬ 
tire city and that, in his own precinct, 
and the further fact the ticket contain¬ 
ing his name was at the bottom of the 
ballot box showing that it had been 
cast early, corresponding with his ar¬ 
rival at the polls, throws a halo of sus¬ 
picion around him. Either he voted 
for himself or that vote was cast before 
the voters began to think. 

After several hours of fruitless at¬ 
tempts to elect a president, Easton was 
allowed to hang on to the job for the 
time being. Mr. Luke, better known 
as the “wild Texas steer,” led the fight 
of the opposition to the president. He 
charges the octoroon and mulatto mem¬ 
bers of the club with trying to form a 
“Lillie White” clique. Luke insists 
that all negroes who are trying to pass 
as white should join white clubs. He 
says no negro who is trying to leave 
the race shall represent it. As his horns 
are in good fighting trim, he says he 
will push the fight to a finish. There 
can be no better cure for the blues than 
an attendance of the club’s future meet¬ 
ings. “There will be things doing.” 


The War in the Far East 

The unparalelled success of the Jap¬ 
anese arms on land and sea makes that 
little kingdom a world power. Her 
commanders both naval and military are 
easily the ablest on earth. All of their 
campaigns have been planned with con¬ 
summate skill and carried out to the 
letter. The heavy Russian troops have 
in no case been able to withstand the 
shock occasioned by a collision with 
Japan’s light rapidly-moving battalions. 
Every pitched battle has been a Japanese 


victory, no matter which army held the 
best strategic position. In this war 
there are many things in favor of the 
Japs. They are a virtuous people, citi¬ 
zens of a country in which all are equal 
before the law and the protection of 
wihch, like the rays of the sun, fall with 
equal radiance upon all. That coun¬ 
try inculcates truth, honesty ana pa¬ 
triotism by fulfilling every pledge made 
to its citizens. Japan’s population con¬ 
sists of citizens all equal. Russia’s 
population consists of classes and mas¬ 
ses with citizenship practically un¬ 
known. The Japanese soldier is fight¬ 
ing for a country that protects him in all 
of his rights. The Russian soldier is 
fighting for a despotism, where the 
rulers have arbitrary powers and patri¬ 
otism is cultivated with the sword. All 
Japanese have a common interest in their 
country; the great mass of the Russian 
population have not. The Japs are 
fighting to widen the field of human en¬ 
deavor ; the Russians are fighting to in¬ 
crease the power of the few to oppress 
the many. God is with the heathen 
Jap because the Japs have good guns 
and the manhood to use them. No mat¬ 
ter which wins, good will come to the 
whole human race. 


SPREAD OF CRIME. 

The appalling increase of crime of ev¬ 
ery character in this country is claim¬ 
ing the attention of all who are inter¬ 
ested in the future well being of our 
institutions. Our sociologists seem to 
overlook in the study of this 
subject, that this government itself 
or those in charge of its administration 
encourage hypocracy and duplicity. To 
possess virtuous citizens, a government 
must be what it claims to be, it must 
fulfill every obligation due its citizens 
, from the greatest to humblest, must 
make good every pledge, hold sacred 
every promise especially in dealing with 
its citizens. Has this ever been true 
of our government? Lets see. It 
claimed that under the federal constitu¬ 
tion all are free and equal. According 
to the way the laws of this country are 
administered there is not one scintilla of 
truth in that document. The colored citi¬ 
zen is denied his right to vote, denied 
the right of trial by jury when charged 
with violations of the laws, forced to 
pay taxes without representation, while 
fighting the battles of his country the 


sons of the negro soldier are denied en¬ 
trance into its naval and miltary schools. 
At makes no difference what the negro’s 
culture or refinement may be, he is 
forced to ride in “jim crow” cars right 
at the capitol of the nation. The negro 
is ever the victim of the basest, meanest, 
most contemptable prejudice that ever 
cursed a member of the human family. 
And yet this is done in a country that is 
ever boasting of its Christianity, free - 
dom and equality . Is it any wonder 
that hypocracy, dualism and duplicity 
are fast becoming prevailing traits of 
our national life? A government that 
refuses to make good its guarantees to 
a body of citizens simply on account of 
the color of their skin to that extent put 
a premium upon violation of contract. 
Every willful refusal of the government 
to make good its pledges is a premium 
placed on crime. What show have hon¬ 
esty and patriotism in Mississippi and 
South Carolina when public mor¬ 
als are shaped by men like Tillman and 
Vardaman? And yet these men owe 
their power and prominence to govern¬ 
ment’s acquiescence in their crimes. 


The Great Western Stove and Repair 
Co. has removed to 643 South Main 
street. It was to secure larger quar¬ 
ters that made the removal of the com¬ 
pany necessary. It is a healthy sign to 
note that our business men find it neces¬ 
sary to secure larger quarters. This 
company has made wonderful strides. It 
is reliable and deserves well of the 
public.

C. W. FAIRBANKS OF INDIANA. 


Without the Negro Vote Republicans 
Cannot Win 

Without the negro vote the Rtpublican 
party would be hopelessly in the minority, 
and would have no more chance to carry 
the country than Bryan has of carrying 
Pennsylvania. Eliminate from the 
Republican party the negro vote of the 
following states, New York, New Jer¬ 
sey, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and West 
Virginia and what show would that party 
have of electing a president or a con¬ 
gress? Put this vote into the Demo¬ 
cratic column and Roosevelt not only 
could not be elected, but would be the 
last Republican president in this day 
and generation. And what protection 
does the Republican party give the ne¬ 
groes for keeping it in power? What 
attempt has it made to protect the ne¬ 
groes in the enjoyment of their consti¬ 
tutional rights? What steps has it taken 


to give the nine million negroes of this 
country representation in congress? 
With all of the machinery of the govern¬ 
ment in its hands, the president, senate, 
house of representatives and the su¬ 
preme court, what is the Republican 
party doing to protect the negroes in the 
South from death at the stake in di¬ 
rect violation of the federal constitution 
In the past three or four months five 
negroes are known to have been burned 
at the stake, one woman included neither 
of the victims were charged with as¬ 
saults upon women and scores have 
been murdered inc cold blood by 
mobs what actions have federal 
authorities taken to protect the 
life and propertv of these citi¬ 
zens? If the Republican party when in 
power cannot enforce the laws of the 
nation, what is to be gained by putting it 
in power? To keep a party in power 
that cannot or will not enforce the laws 
of the land, is worse than anarchy. If 
the negroes’ constitutional rights are to 
be denied them, trial by jury suspended, 
as it is now in nearly every hamlet of 
this country; if they are to be burned 
at the stake, hanged, shot or tortured 
to death without regard to age, sex, or 
condition at the caprice of the mob, 
what difference does it make to them 
who is president or what party is in 
power? Colored voters of the north and 
west, brethren, whnt are we going to 
do? Shall we continue to vote for a 
party that has betrayed us? A party 
that will not protect us although sworn 
to do so? Shall we continue voting the 
Republican party in power till every 
vestage of our rights have been swept 
away? Till funeral pyres light up every 
street corner; till the mobs suspends 
a hangman’s noose from every tele¬ 
phone pole; till jim crow cars roll in- 
sultly through every street? 

To contend that the outrages com¬ 
plained of are committeed by Democrats 
and the Republican party is therefor not 
to blame, is are feasible as to say that 
the armed policemen, the custodian of 
the law, and claiming to be your friend 
who stands by and allows a burglar to 
peaceably enter your house and murder 
your family and appropriate your goods 
is ,not to blame. 

To whom would you render the most 
aid and comfort if called upon—the 
murderous burglar or your friend?- The 
policeman who violated his sworn duty. 


while in your pay in order that the burg¬ 
lar might make a good job? The con¬ 
stitution of the United States guaran¬ 
tees to every citizen regardless of race, 
color, previous condition the full pro¬ 
tection of the laws and says no citizen 
shall be deprived of life, liberty or prop¬ 
erty, without due process of law, and 
the party in power is sworn to enforce 
the constitution and laws. 

The charge that all mobs are com¬ 
posed of Democrats is a base, malicious 
falsehood. Negroes have been burned 
alive with shocking barbarity in the Re¬ 
publican states, New Jersey, Indiana, Il¬ 
linois, Ohio and Kansas, these burnings 
taking place in each case in cities with 
ample police protection. Come breth¬ 
ren let us reason together. The blood 
of 50,000 of our brothers cries from the 
ground today. Shall we by pursuing 
the same damnable course, sacrifice 50,000 
more lives for the benefit of Republican 
office-holders? There are the Prohibi¬ 
tion, the Socialist and the recently 
formed Lincoln parties, we can vote for 
them, or rather vote for men and meas¬ 
ures, not parties—that’s the watch¬ 
word henceforth. 


A BEAUTIFUL CREED. 

Love for the living and hope for the 
dead, was Ingersoll’s beautiful creed, 
and, what is more beautiful, he lived it. 
If the followers of Jesus Christ in 
America would live this creed, there 
would be no lynchings and burnings at 
the stake, no more race hatred and race 
prejudice. 


AFTER FIFTY-EIGHT YEARS. 

Mrs. Eliza Norris, of this city, will 
leave for Hilldale, Mo., to visit her sis¬ 
ter, from whom she was separated fifty- 
eight years ago, she being sold. The 
strange part of this reunion is, that the 
granddaughter of the man who sold Mrs. 
Noris brings about the reunion by de¬ 
fraying all expenses of the trip. Mrs. 
Norris is much loved by all who know 
her. 


The editorial on the Georgia negro 
burning, in the Times of the 18th, had 
an Otis ring. It did whip the devil 
around the stump, but went straight 
to the mark. The whole thing was a 
farce. It never intended to protect the 
prisoners. Arrangement to burn them 
at the stake had been made several days 
and the officers were parties to the 
brutal scheme. The country will suffer 
for it.

“THERE IS NO LOVE LIKE THE 
OLD LOVE.” 

The reason the negro Republicans 
were turned away from the late Re¬ 
publican banquet, after paying for their 
tickets, is just now coming to the sur¬ 
face. As is well known, the Union 
League Republican Club belongs prac¬ 
tically to the Flint-McLaughlin faction, 
or “push,” gave the banquet commem¬ 
orating the fiftieth anniversary of the 
birth of the Republican party. It is 
now easy to understand why Mr. Flint, 
candidate for the United States Senate, 
and a recent convert from the Demo¬ 
cratic party, would not allow the negro 
Republican members of the league to sit 
at the banquet with himself and his 
Democratic friends, who had been in¬ 
vited, for “There is no love like the old 
love.” 

This brings to our mind a bit of Flint 
history. In 1896, during the McKinley 
campaign, when Republican prospects 
looked gloomy in this state, as editor 
of “The Searchlight,” we found ' it 
necessary to make a canvass among the 
Republicans for subscriptions enough 
to get out the paper, which was support¬ 
ing the Republican ticket with all of its 
energies. Among the Republicans called 
upon was Mr. F. P. Flint, who promptly 
refused to subscribe whe n we urged 
upon him the necessity of individual Re¬ 
publicans aiding the efforts of the paper 
by subscriptions. Mr. Flint, who was 
then preside nt of the McKinley Club, 
replied that “while he was doing every¬ 
thing he could personally to elect Mc¬ 
Kinley, he would not spend a dollar of 
his money to bring about that result.” 
If we had known at that time that he 
had just left the Democratic party, the 
situation would have been explained. We 
confess that our Republican ardor be¬ 
gan to cool off from that time, for we 
met scores of similar Republicans dur¬ 
ing that campaign. Now that the Demo¬ 
cratic party dominates both parties in 
this city and county to the extent that 
black Republicans cannot sit down to a 
Republican banquet, it is a small mat¬ 
ter which wing of the party the negro 
supports. Apropos that Republican 
league banquet episode, the managers 
first gave out that the union waiters 
had refused to serve the negroes. This 
the waiters promptly denied. The un¬ 
ions object to being made the scapegoat 
every time the negro is to be kicked out. 
To appease the wrath of real black Re¬ 
publicans it has been given out that the 
main reason for turning down the col¬ 
ored contingent was that some of them 
were trying to pass as white, and the 
managers thought it unfair to the black 
folks to entertain the yellow folks as 
their representatives, while the yellow 
folks were trying to pass as white folks. 
They claim, with some show of reason, 
that while they have no reluctance to 
sitting at meat with the pure, unadulter¬ 
ated negro, they draw the line on the 
counterfeit white man. It is amusing 


to note that the yellow folks are all 
slipping into the black clubs. Owing to 
the fact that these would-be white folks 
had black mothers or fathers, the white 
folks seem determined to make them 
stay with the black folks. Guess they 
will be good now. 

The colored brothers will vote for 
Democrats this year; it matters not 
which of the local tickets he votes, both 
parties having gone Democratic. 


KEEP YOUR HANDS ON VOUR 
POCKET BOOK. 

The leaders of the “six bits push” 
known as the Afro-American Council is 
in desperate straits seeing that the color¬ 
ed citizens whom they are misrepresent¬ 
ing and disgracing have decided to set 
down upon them have hatched up a new 
scheme. The call for the so-called con¬ 
gress give each race organization one 
delegate for each twenty members or 
fraction thereof as the constitution 
grants. Seeing the hand writing on 
the wall and their occupation gone, the 
old discarded gang of political dead 
beats got together and decided that the 
only way to keep themselves in a posi¬ 
tion to do cheap politics was to cut 
down the representation of all race or¬ 
ganization except the two or three coun¬ 
cils embracing the congress to one dele¬ 
gate and one at large to each of such 
organizations. To make it plain, a so- 
called Afro-American council, the mem¬ 
bership of which consists of its officers, 
will claim membership of say 150 or more 
if the case is desperate and send to the con¬ 
gress any six hot air pumpers who have 
a thirst for stale beer and cheap free 
cigars during the campaign, provided 
that the said beer chasers agreed to 
vote for certain irresponsible leaders for 
ill-gotten revenue only, while an organ¬ 
ization with 100 or 150 real members 
would have but two votes, who changed 
the constitution so as to make Neimore 
and his gang its sole executors, the con¬ 
gress didn't do it and that is the. only 
body invested with power. Neimore 
was thrown bodily out of the last con¬ 
gress. He was candidate for every of¬ 
fice in sight but never received more 
than 2 votes out of 50. To enable him 
to work his graft on candidates for of¬ 
fice it was decided to call him president 
of the local council and sign his name 
to the call for the congress. If he was 
elected president of the local council 
there were not over three persons pres¬ 
ent. or he could not have been elected. 
This hold-up scheme will not work. 
All candidates for office are warned to 
keep their hands on their pocket books. 

The time has come when the race must 
set down upon the negro who makes 
politics his trade and whose thirst for 
office constitutes the bulk of his worldly 
effects. The seeker after cheap no¬ 
toriety and the would-be political boss 
are equally dangerous. By the character 
of our leaders we are judged and re¬ 
spected. We must require of our lead¬ 


ers what the white people require of 
their. 


WHAT SHALL WE DO? 

The burning of Cato and Reed in 
Georgia on the 16th adds another to 
the long list of atrocious, brutal out¬ 
rages that are being perpetrated upon 
the negroes almost daily. And the pain¬ 
ful fact that there is absolutely no ef¬ 
fort on the part of the state or federal 
authorities to punish the perpetrators 
is something awful. The position of 
the negro in this country is growing 
worse and worse. What shall we do? 
What is to become of the American ne¬ 
gro? To retaliate, as these outrages 
deserve, is out of the question. Such a 
course would consign our women and 
children, our aged, sick and help¬ 
less, to the flames. Southern preju¬ 
dice, Southern hatred of the negro, be¬ 
cause he is free, like deadly poison 
ramifies every artery in the body of 
American public sentiment. Loyalty to 
the flag, obedience to the laws, the own¬ 
ership of character and property, cuts no 
figure if your skin is black. The Booker 
Washington theory is well nigh ex¬ 
ploded. The sober, thoughtful negroes 
have almost lost hope. What is life or 
property worth in the jaws of such a 
bitter, heartless persecution? The white 
person who believes that there is no 
hell ought to change the texture of his 
hair and change the color of his skin 
from white to black, then come and 
live in Christian America. He would 
awake in a hell as cruel and relentless 
as any that orthodox Christians have 
discovered. He would be as far away 
from God as any lost soul could pos¬ 
sibly be. The thought that there ever 
was a Golden Rule would be like live 
coals of fire upon his body. 

If Reed and Cato were guilty, they 
should have been hanged, as the law 
directs. They had been tried and sen¬ 
tenced to death. As to their guilt there 
will ever be a doubt in the minds of 
fair-minded people, and no doubt the 
conviction was secured with the under¬ 
standing that it would save them from 
the stake. With a howling, blood¬ 
thirsty mob surrounding the court, no 
honest man believes that the men had 
a fair trial. If they confessed in court, 
as it is claimed, they did so to escape 
the fate they met. They knew when 
they were accused that it meant death, 
whether guilty or innocent. The lip 
about Reed’s alleged confession to the 
mob implicating others is the same old 
lie manufactured by the same old band 
of cut-throats that have secured previ¬ 
ous confessions when they wanted to 
kill or burn a few innocent negroes as 
a pastime. Doubtless the crime was 
committed by a white man and a mem¬ 
ber of that mob. 

THE WHITE NEWSPAPERS RE¬ 
SPONSIBLE. 

The Los Angeles Times says editor¬ 
ially, in part: “Without a doubt these 







THE LIBERATOR. 


convicted murderers deserve to be 
hanged.” The above seems to us to be 
not only a quasi-endorsement of the 
mob, but a presumption, with all of the 
facts against it, that the accused had 
a fair and impartial trial; while the 
truth of the matter is, they were tried 
in a court in the presence of a few un¬ 
armed officers, who were in sympathy 
with the howling mob that surrounded 
the court. To say that a conviction se¬ 
cured under such circumstances is just, 
and that the convicted deserved hang¬ 
ing, is an endorsement of the mob. 
This was doubtless not the object of 
the writer of the sentence quoted, but 
that is what he did. That the white 
newspapers of this country are respon¬ 
sible for the prevalence of crime, there 
is not the slightest doubt. These editor¬ 
ial snake killers set out, perhaps, with 
good intentions, but, through sympathy 
or the Lord knows what, they pound 
off the snake's tail instead of his head, 
and leave him more deadly and vicious 
than before. Magnifying the crime with 
which the mob’s victim was charged, 
and for which he was never tried or 
proven guilty, may satisfy the con¬ 
science of the average white man, but 
it will not stave off the day of reckon¬ 
ing. By toying with the mobs the news¬ 
papers and those responsible for the 
enforcement of the laws, are playing 
hell with this country, and the time will 
come, and come sooner than they ex¬ 
pect, when they wil call upon the rocks 
and mountains to fall upon them and 
hide them from the wraht of their own 
lawless people. 

When the great and good McKinley 
fell a victim to the mob spirit, a cry 
of righteous indignation against law- 
Ies j n ess went^ from the North, EJast 
and West. Lincoln was the victim of 
the slavery curse; Garfield, the spoils 
system; McKinley, the mob spirit. Who 
,s , to be the next victim? By the eter¬ 
nal God of Justice , there'll he a dav of 
reckoningf 


NOTICE l 

The Colored Business Men's Asso¬ 
ciation will hold an important meeting 
at Flint's Grocery Store, 243 E. Second 
street, on Friday evening, August 26th, 
at 7:30 o'clock. A full attendance is 
expected. 


(Special Dispatch to the Call.) 

JACKSON, Miss., Aug. 18—Negro 
labor unions are being organized here 
with the purpose of boycotting the 
whites and throwing all their business 
to other negroes. 

The movement is the result of the 
passage of the “Jim Crow” street car 
law, which greatly angered the ne¬ 
groes. They successfully boycotted the 
cars, and no negroes are patrons of 
them. 

A negro bank and a negro undertaking 
establishment will be started, and a 
negro department store and other ne¬ 
gro establishments are in contempla¬ 
tion. 

There is a disposition on the part of 
the whites to encourage foreign immi¬ 
gration, particularly of Italians, as a 
safeguard against this threatened ac¬ 
tion. 


Mr. Theodore Brooks has a steady job 
in the city at his trade. He is a car¬ 
penter well equipped to do anything in 
his line.
