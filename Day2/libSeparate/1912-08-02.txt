Prominent Negroes of the Independent League 
Interview Woodrow Wilson 


IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE 
ATTITUDE OF GOV. WILSON, 


Democratic Candidate for Presi¬ 
dent, towards the Negro and his 
Rights, a Committee from the Na¬ 
tional Independent Political League 
composed of the following gentle¬ 
men interviewed the Governor on 
July 16 th. 


They were Rev. J. Milton Wald¬ 
ron, of Washington, D. C., national 
organizer, Dr. Win. H. Harris of 
Washington, a vice-president and 
assistant organizer, Wm. Monroe 
Trotter, of Boston, Mass., secretary, 
Robert N. Wood, chairman of the 
Colored Democracy of New York, 
and A. B. Cosey, Esq., chairman 
of the Colored Democracy of New 
Jersey and committeeman of the 
Independent League. 

The Interview. 

Rev. Waldron opened the inter¬ 
view' by telling the Democratic 
candidate that this Colored league 
was out against Republicans for 
deceiving the Colored people not 
protecting them, and was advocat¬ 
ing a division of the Colored vote, 
and that these men in view of the 
failure of the Democratic conven¬ 
tion to put in a plank in favor of 
the Colored people, wanted the 
race to have some assurance from 
him that he was not against their 
equal rights. He then called on 
Mr. Trotter who read a typewritten 
appeal to the Governor to assure 
the Colored people that as presi¬ 
dent he would not favor aggressions 
in their rights. The appeal was 
then handed to the Governor. Next 
Mr. Wood appealed to the Governor 
as a man of high training and with 


an untrammeled nomination to set 
an example of a democrat and 
Southerner who would oppose in¬ 
justice and oppression for color. 

The Governor’s reply — -“I will 
observe the law and in the spirit of 
Christianity.” 

The Governor in reply expressed 
himself as in moral sympathy with 
the formal appeal read by Mr. Trot¬ 
ter. He said that the president did 
not have power to interfere with 
all the appeal contained, but he 
deprecated race and color preju¬ 
dice. 

“If elected to the Presidency,” 
he said, “I shall observe the law 
in its letter and spirit. And this 
is after all a rather low standard. 

I shall do so in the spirit of the 
Christian religion. As President 
I shall try to be a Christian gen¬ 
tleman.” 

In answer to a question he said 
he would accord even-handed jus¬ 
tice and equal rights to all regard¬ 
less of race or color in his position 
as president. 

The Governor was told of the 
charge that he was the enemy of 
the Colored people and their rights. 
He asserted that this was not true. 
He expressed himself as being their 
friend and was sorry he was so mis¬ 
represented. He said that he be¬ 
lieved that according to the Colored 
people, rights and recognition in 
the North would tend to bring this 
about in the South, and that he 
believed color prejudice would 
gradually die out there by the pro¬ 
gressive development of the sense 
of justice. 

The Governor authorized the 
members of the delegation to make 
known to the Colored people his 


position. All thanked him for hi s 
friendly expressions and willingnes 
to encourage a division of the 
Colored vote and asked him to 
make a public statement. He said 
he had no desire to urge the race 
issue with the campaign, as he 
regarded the omission of any Negro 
plank in the Democratic platform 
to mean that no race issue was in¬ 
volved as no attack on anybody’s 
rights was contemplated, but that 
when during the campaign, the 
matter came up or an occasion pre¬ 
sented itself he would speak of it. 

Delegation Pleased. 

The interview lasted over twenty 
minutes. At the close the Gover¬ 
nor shook hands cordially with 
each one and each thanked him for 
his friendly expressions. With the 
Governor’s hand clasped in his, 
Mr. Trotter said: “Governor, a 
special responsibility rests on me 
as editor of a Colored newwspaper. 
I am glad I can tell the Colored 
people that if elected president 
you will accord even-handed and 
equal rights to all regardless of 
race or color.” “Certainly,” said 
the Governor, positively.

NO NEGRO ENDORSED 

In spite of the fact that the 
Negroes have two candidates for 
office, to be voted for at the coming 
primaries and despite the fact of 
the colored voter’s loyalty to the 
Johnson-Lissner machine, that said 
machine gave the Negroes no con¬ 
sideration in handing out their 
indorsement. 

Rev. David R. Jones, a man of 
good character and of exceptional 





























TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


ability, is candidate for Supervisor 
from "the Second Supervisorial dis¬ 
trict and Rev. Edward T. Hubbard 
a man also of good character and 
excellent attainments, is candidate 
for the Assembly from the 74th 
Assembly district and both of 
whom are on the Roosevelt end 
of the struggle in this state, despite 
this fact, and although the Johnson- 
Lissner machine expect the Negroes 
of this county to support Col. 
Bolter Brownsville Roosevelt for 
president against President Taft, 
they treated Jones and Hubbard 
as well as the Negro voters with 
the utmost contempt. The Negro 
who can support any candidate en¬ 
dorsed by the Lissner . machine, 
must be a miserable specimen of a 
Negro. And such a Negro is un¬ 
worthy of the confidence of his 
race. Imagine the race having 
a worse enemy than such a cheap 
unmanly traitor in black. 

As for Mr. Lissner, he has never 
shown any disposition to give the 
Negro a square deal; and he, being 
a Jew, a member also of an op¬ 
pressed and despised race, one 
would hardly expect to find in him 
a wide-horned ox in the pathway 
of a struggling, down-trodden peo¬ 
ple. But such is nevertheless the 
truth. 


KEPT COLONEL ROOSEVELT 
FROM SPEAKING TO THE 
COLORED Y. M. C. A. 


Several years ago, when Col. 
Roosevelt visited this city to lec¬ 
ture in the interest of the white 
Y. M. C. A., the present secretary 
of the colored Y. M. C. A. ad¬ 
dressed a letter to Mr. Roosevelt 
asking him to make a short speech 
for that branch which would re¬ 
sult in great financial aid for it. 
In reply, Col. Roosevelt expressed 
not only a willingness, but a desire 
to aid them with a speech and per¬ 
sonal appeal for money the branch 
needed. He, however, stated that 
he was in the hands of Mr. Lissner 
and would be governed by his 
wishes in the matter, or words 
to that effect. When the matter 
was taken up with Mr. Lissner, it 
was turned down with the propo¬ 


sition that the Negroes might have 
one or more tickets to the Roose¬ 
velt lecture. In this, he was unlike 
the great Julius Rosenwald, also 
a Jew, who is giving hundreds of 
thousands of dollars of his own 
money to primote just such in¬ 
stitutions. 

When Mr. Lissner, as head of the 
Good Government movement, ap¬ 
pealed to the colored voters to 
assist in rescuing this city and 
state from the so-called machine, 
they went to his rescue, in spite 
of the persecution and denuncia¬ 
tion heaped upon them. As soon 
as the Lissner machine took the 
place of the old, the color line was 
drawn in the public service. For 
the first time in fifteen years, all 
the Negroes have been let out of 
the public parks, and all teams 
owned by Negroes turned out of 
the street department. Juggling 
the civil service the Negroes 
are kept out of the 
police and fire departments and 
the door of the Nurse-training 
department of the County Hos¬ 
pital closed to the colored girls 
simply on account of their color. 
With a record like this, made by 
the Lissner Good Goverbment push, 
is there a Negro so base and un¬ 
manly as to support a candidate 
burdened with their endorsement? 
With a record like the above, for 
them to expect the Negro vote, 
shows the contempt with which 
they hold the Negro. 

In the 74th Assembly District, 
a District containing a larger Negro 
population than perhaps any other 
similar District in the state, they 
ignored Rev. E. T. Hubbard, the 
Negro candidate, and who is also 
a Roosevelt supporter and indorsed 
Mr. Mouser, thus denying to the 
Negroes representation. This ac¬ 
tion has made plain the duty of 
every Negro in that district, and 
that is to see to it that either 
Mr. E. T. Hubbard or Mr. F. R. 
Pitney or the strongest opposition 
candidate is given the nomination 
in that district. With the Lissner 
indorsement, Mr. Mouser, though 
a good man, is too heavy for the 
Negro voters to carry. 

We understand that the Lissner 


machine has also endorsed Mr. 
Henry Lyon for State Senator, but 
that endorsement was given Mr. 
Lyon to handicap him, knowing 
as they did, that owing to his 
popularity, he could win without 
it. With their solid opposition, 
Mr. Lyon, with the support of 
the Negroes, was elected to the 
Assembly two years ago. Mr. 
Lyon’s popularity with the colored 
voters is due to his individual, 
square dealings with them. 


“TAMING THE WILD” 


“Taming the Wild” was the sub¬ 
ject of a lecture delivered at the 
Y. M. C. A.'by Mr. J. L. Mureham 
of Arizona last Sunday. A good 
sized audience was present and was 
much edified by the lecturer. 


BURN A WHITE MAN ALIVE 


Boys Wanted to See Him Run 

(By Federal Wireless Line to the 
Times.) 

MEMPHIS (Tenn.) July 29.— 
(Special Dispatch.) Two boys, one 
18 and the other ten, are under 
arrest here charged with burning 
a man to death. They are Mitch¬ 
ell Cabiniss and Clarence Shaw. 
Shaw, the elder of the boys, is held 
for manslaughter, while the other 
has been turned over to the Juven¬ 
ile Court. The boys while walking 
through one of the city parks, saw 
Robert Ellis, a tramp, asleep on 
a bench. They procured a gallon 
of oil, poured it over his clothing, 
and applied a match. The flames, 
leaping ten feet in the air, roasted 
the man from head to foot. Their 
only excuse was that they wished to 
see Ellis “hot foot it through the 
park.” 


MR. P. J. ALEXANDER, A WELL 
KNOWN JANITOR, REMOVES 
TO HIS RANCH. 


It is no uncommon thing for 
white men who, after holding po¬ 
sitions as janitors and custodians 
of buildings, to resign such posi¬ 
tions to become ranchers. We 
know of several cases of well-to-do 
ranchers who a few years 


























THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


ago were janitors in this city.. But 
colored men holding such positions 
in too many cases never aspire 
to anything higher. Too often 
they are perfectly contented to 
hold such positions till dismissal 
or death, and then bequeath them 
to their sons. It is useless to say 
that no toil, no matter how humble, 
is dishonorable; but, every laborer 
should be ambitious to some day 
employ himself. To be without 
such ambition, is to be wanting 
in a very important trait. 

Mr. P. J. Alexander, of the firm 
of Alexander & Bowman, janitors 
and custodians of the Fay building 
for a number of years, has set an 
example that scores of our citizens 
and heads of families could follow 
with profit. Some time ago, 
Messrs. Alexander and Jackson 
purchased a twenty-acre ranch at 
Cypress Station 40 minute’s ride 
from this city and removed there 
with their families in order that 
their children might enjoy the 
freedom of the country, and at 
the same time learn the lessions 
of self-dependence. They have ten 
acres in corn and a fine crop of 
sugar beets. Aside from their corn 
and beet crops, they have 650 head 
of poultry and send to the market 
from 8 to 32 dozen eggs per day. 
They are preparing to go exten¬ 
sively into hog raising. 

The ladies and children are sim¬ 
ply delighted with the change and 
would not exchange their free, easy, 
happy country life for that of the 
city. 

While still holding his position 
as custodian of the Fay building, 
Mr. Alexander makes the trip 
morning and evening to and from 
the city and says the change pro¬ 
duced by the round trip is some¬ 
thing delightful. He hopes in the 
near future to with Mr. Jackson 
to give his entire attention to the 
ranch. Their water for irrigation 
is supplied by a flowing artesian 
well on the premises. Mr, Alex¬ 
ander owns an excellent home in 
this city; this with his ranch is 
conclusive proof that he has made 
good use of his earnings while 
serving as janitor and laid well the 
foundations for future independence 


The children of such men are very 
apt to act well their part in race 
development. 

A statement made by a Pullman 
conductor is worthy of repitition 
just here. Standing in front of 
his car, in his bright new suit, a 
friend stepping up to him, said: 
“You look so kingly in that suit,” 
Perhaps so,” said the conductor, 
“but I hope my son will never 
wear such a suit with its beautiful 
buttons and cap. It is a badge of 
servitude.” “If my son shouldbecome 
a railroad man, I trust he will 
reach a position that will require 
nothing to designate his em¬ 
ployment.” The moral is plain. 

ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


The Annual Old Folks’ Dinner, 
at the First A. M. E. Church, was 
largely attended. The attendence 
being the largest in the history. 
There were quite a number of 
persons past eighty and more than 
a score past seventy. There were 
many interesting reminescences re¬ 
lated by that group of men and 
women, the remnant of a genera¬ 
tion that has passed. 


THE VENICE BAPTIST CHURCH 
CLOSES BIG RALLY 


Other Seaside Notes 


The big rally at the Venice 
Baptist Church resulted in raising 
over two hundred dollars. The 
B. Y. P. U. of the church rendered 
a pleasing literary program which 
closed the rally. Mr. Jas. A. 
Reese, president of the local Union 
and secretary of the B. Y. P. U. of 
Southern California, introduced Mr. 
Henderson in a very appropriate 
manner, who delivered the wel 1 
come address and Mr. W. G. Ran¬ 
dolph, president of S. S. Convention 
responded to the welcome address 
which was well received by the 
audience. Mr. E. J. Peters acted 
as master of ceremonies. A splen¬ 
did program was rendered. Among 
those taking part were Mrs. A. L. 
Reese, who rendered an instrumen¬ 
tal solo; Mr. L. Hubbard and Miss 
Margaret Prince each sang solos. 


Excellent papers were read by 
Messrs. A. L. Reese, S. Sercy and 
J. A. Reese. Duet by Messrs. 
Fields and Givens with an instru¬ 
mental selection by W. G. Ran¬ 
dolph. Participants on the pro¬ 
gram being composed of the best 
talent of Los Angeles, Pasadena 
and Venice was rendered to the 
great delight of a big audience. 
The B. Y. P. U. donated the church 
$26.00. The captain was presented 
wirh a beautiful hand-made center- 
piece made by the pastor’s wife. 


Avery dainty three course lun¬ 
cheon was served Sunday at the 
Bay City Cafe. Covers were laid 
for ten. 


The rally of the First Baptist 
Church of Venice ended Sunday. 
A large sum of money was turned 
in by the various clubs. 

Messrs. Claude Tylor and W. R. 
Pollard were pleasant callers Sun¬ 
day. 


Mrs. E. V. Moxley, J. A. Stout 
and Misses Mattie Dudley, Ella

THE JAPANESE EMPEROR 
DEAD 


The death of the Japanese Em- 
poror which occured this week, 
brought to an end a glorious reign. 
During the forty-four years that 
he had occupied the Japanese 
throne, that nation has risen from 
an insignificant position to a place 
among the first world-powers. 
Their military success is unequalled 
by any modern nation and their 
crushing defeat of the Russian 
armies marks the beginning of the 
ascendency of the dark races. 
Their glorious victory over Russia 
has been heralded among the dark 


races whether savage or civilized 
everywhere and hailed as the break¬ 
ing of the day—the coming of the 
reign of unerversal justice. In the 
far away impenetrable jungles of 
Africa where the newspaper and 
telegraph have never been seen or 
heard, the story of that great 
victory is as well understood and as 
generally known among the savage 
tribes as it is in London or Paris. 


Messrs. B. A. Johnson, Fred Butler 
and Mr. Taylor of Sacramento, 
were pleasant callers at our office 
this week. These gentlemen are 
prominent in business and social 
circles in the Capitol City. 


GOLDEN ADVICE 

During his sermon last Sunday, 
Rev. Kenchen made a strong and 
fervent appeal for more race love 
and unity. He strongly condemn 
ed the frequency with which church 
members settle their differences in 
court, which could be more easily 
settled out of court., and warned 
colored lawyers against encourag¬ 
ing litigation among the race. 
While practicing their profession, 
the Negro lawyers can render a 
great service to the race by dis¬ 
couraging unnecessary lawsuits. 
The examples set by Abraham 
Lincoln and other great lawyers of 
this country who discouraged in 
every way possible lawsuits that 
could be settled out of court, are 
worthy of emulation. 

Of course, such lawyers did not 
become millionares, but rendered 
services to humanity that will be 
as lasting as the race. 

He also urged newspaper, men 
to keep themselves out of their 
editorial columns to the end that 
they be not used to vent personal 
spleen. But that they make use 
of their space to encoursge race 
unity and elevation, while fear¬ 
lessly condemning practices that 
tend to impede the progress of 
the race. He said, however, that 
the editors who have brought about 
great reforms were uncompromis¬ 
ing and fierce in their denuncia¬ 
tion of wrong. He sighted Horace 
Greely and William Lloyd Garrison 


as shining examples. He said fur¬ 
ther that men who act from high 
motives frequently found themselves 
compelled to take positions and 
say things that they had rather 
not say, but placing duty above 
personal feelings, they fearlessly 
performed their tasks. Only big 
men can do such things. 


MR. F. R. PITNEY FOR THE 
ASSEMBLY 


The gentleman whose name ap¬ 
pears above is a candidate for 
Assemblyman and is worthy of 
the support of every honest and 
intelligent voter in his district. 
We refer to and heartily recommend 
Frank R. Pitney, who will go to 
Sacramento and will represent the 
74th District. Remarks upon Mr. 
Pitney’s ability and fitness for the 
position are unnecessary. He is 
an old Los Angeles boy and well 
and favorably known. However, 
to those who are not personally 
acquaintsd with Mr. Pitney, we 
can truly state that we know him 
to be absolutely fair and square, 
honest and outspoken in his con¬ 
victions. Calls a spade a spade, 
and, irrespective of creed, color or 
wealth, will serve all the people 
all the time. You can vote for 
him without making a mistake. 


Atty. W. O. Tyler delivered a 
splendid address to a big crowd 
at the Lyceum last Sunday. In a 
masterly way he reviewed the 
political history of the country 
from the formation of the govern¬ 
ment to the close of the recon¬ 
struction period. 

He closed his address with a 
strong appeal to the audience for 
the cultivation of patriotism and 
those manly and womanly traits 
of character that commands the 
respect of right thinking people.

the trees, developing land and selling 
orchards are open to shareholders of 
this company. The 8 per cent pre¬ 
ferred stock is unlimited in sharing all 
profits beyond 8 per cent.
