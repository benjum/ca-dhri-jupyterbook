A Description of the Ga. Chaingang 

by Judge Speer, the Brutal Whip¬ 
ping Boss. 

The most cursory view of the evi¬ 
dence in the record will convince the 
impartial that practically every igno- 
minous mark of infamous punishment 
is stamped upon the miserable throng 
in Bibb county chaingang. This is 
clear from the testimony of the super¬ 
intendent, E. A. Wimbish, and from 
the uncontradicted evidence of wit¬ 
nesses who have there expatiated 
their disregard of sundry provisions of 
the City Code. The sufferers wear 
the typical striped clothing of the peni-, 
tentiary convict. Iron manacles are 
riveted upon their legs. ■ These can be 
removed only by the use of the cold 
chisel. The irons on each leg are con¬ 
nected by chains. The coarse stripes, 
thick with the dust and grime of long 
torrid days of a semi-tropical summer, 
or encrusted with the icy mud of win¬ 
ter, are their sleeping clothes when 
they throw themselves on their pal¬ 
lets or straw in the common stockades 
at night. They wake, toil, rest, eat 
and sleep, to the never-ceasing clank¬ 
ing of the manacles and chains of this 
invoulntary slavery. Their progress 
to and from their work is public, and 
from dawn to dark, with brief inter¬ 
mission, they toil on the public roads 
and before the public eye. 

About them as they sleep, journey 
and labor watch the convict guards 
armed with rifle and shot gun. This is 
to at once make escape impossible, 
and to make sure the swift thudding 
of the picks and the rapid flight of the 
shovels shall never cease. If the 
guards would hesitate to promptly kill 
one sentenced for petty violations of 
city law should he attempt to escape, 
the evidence does not disclose the 
fact. And the fact more baleful and 
more ignominous than all, with each 
gang stands the whipping boss, with 
the badge of his authority. This the 
evidence discloses to be a heavy leath¬ 
ern strap about two and a half or 
three ft. long, with solid hand grasp, 
and with broad, heavy and flexible lash. 
From the evidence we may judge that 
the agony inflicted by this implement 
of torture is not surpassed by the Rus¬ 
sian knout, the synonym the world 
around for merciless corporal punish¬ 
ment. If we may also accept -the un¬ 
contradicted evidence of the witnesses 
it is true that on the Bibb county 
chaingang for no day is the strap 
wholly idle and not infrequently it is 
fiercely active. One witness, who 
served many months, testified that if 
the gang does not work like “fighting 
fire,” to use his simile, the whipping 
boss runs down the line, striking with 
apparent indiscrimination the convicts 
as they bend to their tasks. Often 
the whipping is more prolonged and 


deliberate. At times, according to an¬ 
other witness, also uncontradicted, the 
convicts when at tne stockade are 
called into the “dog lot.” All present, 
the whipping boss selects the victims 
in his judgment worthy of punishment. 

They are called to the stable door 
and made to lie face downward across 
the sill, a strong convict holds down 
the head and shoulders and the boss 
lays on the lash on the naked body 
until he thinks the sufferer has been 
whipped enough. 


ATTORNEY BLAIR WINS A VIC¬ 
TORY. 

Some time ago a young colored man 
was lodged in jail charged with at¬ 
tempting to snatch a white lady’s 
purse. On the evening of the arrest, 
the lady who made the charge, in com¬ 
pany with a companion, was taking a 
walk with her purse swinging from 
one of her arms in the usual style. 
The colored man imprudently passed 
between the ladies and in so doing, 
in some manner got fastened to the 
purse. With might and main the lady 
held to her purse while her compan¬ 
ion set up a scream that brought 
everybody in the neighborhood to the 
street. To the colored man, who was 
just from the south, the lady’s screams 
sounded like the crack of doom and he 
set out on a wild run but was soon 
overhauled and turned over to the 
police. At the police station he was 
so non-plussed that he didn’t know 
whom he was or where he was going. 
When the case was brought to trial 
in the superior court the prisoner’s 
conviction was regarded as a foregone 
conclusion. On the witness stand the 
prisoner who knew nothing of himself 
or where he lived, testified that as 
he passed between u>e ladies the 
purse chain got fastened to a button 
on his sleeve which caused all the 
trouble. This sounded so fishy t-hat 
his case seemed hopeless. As soon as 
Mr. Blair took up the cross-examina¬ 
tion the prosecution that had all along 
been confident became alarmed. His 
cross-examination was so rigid that 
the witnesses for the prosecution be¬ 
came panic stricken and was as badly 
at sea as was the prisoner. The jury 
promptly gave the prisoner the bene¬ 
fit of the doubt and discharged him. 
Seven members of the jury were 
Southern white men. After severely 
castigating the district attorney for 
his method of getting evidence, Mr. 
Blair, with his usual vigor, made a 
very ingenious argument to the jury. 
Among other things he told them that 
pocket-picking, purse snatching, dia¬ 
mond nipping, burglary and counter¬ 
feiting were professions exclusively 
the white man’s, and that while the 
negro is rising and will ultimately be¬ 
come intelligent enough to enter these 


professions, they are at present in ab¬ 
solute undisputed possession of the 
white man. 

In passing between the ladies the 
colored man acted rude and ungentle- 
manly, and, but for the legal and 
forensic ability of Attorney Blair, he 
would be in the penitentiary. 

The Times described the prisoner 
as “a burly black negro,” but when he 
was put on trial the judge thought he 
was white on account of his fair com¬ 
plexion and straight hair. The whole 
trial was a great victory for Blair. 


A FOOLISH HABIT. 

It is very seldom that a distin¬ 
guished colored man or woman ever 
travels as far west as California, and 
when they do we ought to take ad¬ 
vantage oi every opportunity to make 
them welcome and to learn a lesson 
from their lives. 

But’the most foolish habit the col¬ 
ored people have and the most humil¬ 
iating to the visitors, is to invite them 
to deliver a rmblic address and then 
take up the best half of the occasion 
delivering foolish welcoming addresses 
and singing stale solos. 

The colored people have turned out 
in large numbers to several meetings 
where some prominent visitor was to 
speak when almost the entire evening 
would be taken up by local soloist and 
welcoming orations and, before the vis¬ 
itor, the one whom the people came to 
hear and see, can finish speaking, they 
have to leave in order to get the last 
car going to their homes. It is said 
on good authority that Dr. Bowen, the 
most learned colored man that ever 
visited California, said that he wished 
the colored people would learn not to 
take up their time with solos and wel¬ 
coming speeches when they invite 
them to speak, as they can hear as 
good singing at home and there was 
absolutely nothing in the speeches. 

In the case of Mrs. Washington, it 
was not as bad as we have seen, al¬ 
though the two solos and the four 
welcoming speeches should have been 
omitted, with the possible exception 
of one address and that should have 
been delivered by Mrs. Stovall for 
all the clubs, thus saving a half hour 
for Mrs. Washington and the public. 


A NEW LODGING HOUSE. 

Mrs. C. L. Campbell has removed from 
125 Vine street to 815 Lynden street, 
where she has fitted up a first-class 
rooming house. For furnished rooms, 
neat and sunny, at reasonable rates, call 
and see her. Mrs. Campbell makes a 
specialty of supplying families with

MR. 


AND MRS. H. A. HARROLL OF 
CRAFTONVILLE, CAL. 


Mr. Harroll is not only the wealth¬ 
iest colored farmer in Southern Cali¬ 
fornia, but is one of our most practi¬ 
cal men. For a number of years he 
was manager of a large orange ranch 
at Craftonville and was one of the 
largest shippers of oranges in that lo¬ 
cality. As the owner of the ranch 
lived in the east, Mr. Harroll had com¬ 
plete control and while keeping the 
ranch in first-class shape, made it pay 
as large an income as any ranch there. 
A few days ago he purchased the Dal¬ 
ton ranch on Citrus and Crafton ave¬ 
nues, paying $12,000 cash. This is 
doubtless the largest cash deal ever 


made by a colored farmer in this sec¬ 
tion. He is a staunch supporter of all 
worthy race enterprises and his use¬ 
fulness as a member of the race in¬ 
creases with his business success. On 
a visit to this city last summer he 
found the members of the Wesley M. 
E. church struggling to raise $2000 
and handed them a check for fifty dol¬ 
lars. He pays for and reads every 
colored paper in the state. A man of 
his calibre will succeed in anything he 
undertakes and will have and enjoy 
wealth because he aspires for some¬ 
thing higher. 


A Tribute to Paul Laurence Dunbar. 

Paul Laurence Dunbar is dead. 
There were only seven or eight lines 
in the newspapers yesterday to chron¬ 
icle the fact. Yet there was not a 
newspaper in the world but published 
those seven or eight lines. While the 
bustling, the busy, the harsh and 
greedy age made as little of the cir¬ 
cumstance as it was possible to do, 
still it could not ignore the fact alto¬ 
gether. It had columns of space in 
its newspapers to give to the financier 
who had been discovered Jto be a 
thief, to the hollow words and the in¬ 
finitely worthless acts of politicians, 
but to the dead poet—seven or eight 
lines. 

But when all these who strut their 
brief hour on the stage of human ac¬ 
tion and human interest are long for¬ 
gotten, the name of Paul Laurence 


Dunbar will live. He. was just a sin¬ 
ger, but weary men and weary women 
needed his songs, and when we of to¬ 
day are long in our graves there will 
be men and women to come after us 
who will need his songs again. For, 
rush and hurry through life as we 
will, and as we do, following the false 
light and grasping at greed with our 
puny strength, deep down in the worst 
of us all, there is a hunger for the 
good, for the beautiful and the true. 
Paul Laurence Dunbar was among 
those whose mission it was to satisfy 
and to feed that hunger, and few that 
ever lived fulfilled their missions more 
successfully. Like Keats, he died 
young, not yet having reached his 
thirty-fourth year. Like Burns, he 
came up from the sweet fragrance of 
the soil. He was born poor, the son 
of a father and mother who were 


slaves. He earned his education by 
working as an elevator boy in Wash¬ 
ington. But, how futile and how un¬ 
availing are handicaps that the world 
puts on the soul that God endows with 
divine fire? 

This young negro poet goes down 
to his early grave as one of the im¬ 
mortals. It has been prophesied that 
the negro race would yet give us our 
greatest poet and our greatest musi¬ 
cian. Paul Dunbar went far to prove 
that the prophecy will yet come true. 
As it is, the only real American music 
that we have was given to us by the 
negro. And no land, no country or 
time has produced anything sweeter 
or more inspired than the “Sorrow 
Songs" of the rice fields and the plan¬ 
tations—songs that ever wrung from 
the souls of them who were shackled 
with our gyves, and bound in infamy 
to the wheel of the bondsman. 

Dead is the poet. Tonight, beyond 
the stars he sits with Keats, with 
Burns and Shelly and all that palm- 
crowned company who went before 
him. No color line will be drawn 
there, but arm in arm will they wan¬ 
der together down the golden high¬ 
ways of God’s eternal Land of Beauty. 
He was one with them, and great will 
be his welcome.—The Times. 


THE GRIM REAPER BUSY. 

Dr. Hiram A. Reid, the wellknown 
local historian and prominent citizen 
of Pasadena, has been gathered to his 
Father. Dr. Reid was identified with 
every movement that had for its ob¬ 
ject the moral uplifting of his com¬ 
munity. His love included the men 
of every race. He seemed to be a to- 
tal stranger to race and color preju¬ 
dice, and was intensely interested in 
the welfare of the colored people. He 
was present at nearly every meeting 
held by the colored citizens of Pasa¬ 
dena to consider ways and means for 
bettering their condition and was ever 
ready to aid them in any way he could. 
At the Emancipation celebration held 
in Pasadena January last, with a num¬ 
ber of gray haired veterans, he occu¬ 
pied a front seat and rejoiced that as 
a soldier in the civil war he had 
helped to make that evening possible. 
As he had done many times before, he 
warmly shook our hand and bade us 
God speed in our struggle for equal 
protection of the law and for equality 
of opportunity. It is extremely sad 
to note the rapidity with which the 
ranks of those who stand for absolute 
justice are being thinned.

DUNBAR NO MORE. 

Paul Laurence Dunbar, the great 
negro poet, is dead. He has joined 
the colony of immortals on heaven's 
eternal camping ground, and for all 
coming time his songs, by dispelling 
care, will sweeten the lives of strug¬ 
gling men and women. When the 
fact that this republic once existed, 
shall have become a dim tradition so 
far as Its position among the nations 
of the earth is concerned, with Long¬ 
fellow, Whittier, Bryant, Lowell and 
Holmes, Dunbar will, in defiance of 
the lapse of time perpetuate the mem¬ 
ory of these states. 

In spite of the tremendous efforts 
that are being put forward in this 
country to crush the American negro, 
he Is adding to its glory in every 
department of the earth’s endeavor. 
And when the part played by him in 
the history-making of this country 
shall have been blotted out, its 
achievements will have perished from 
the memory of men. In the halls of 
fine arts in Europe, Tanner’s paintings 
stand for America. In oratory and 
statesmanship, Hon. Frederick Doug¬ 
lass, a negro and fugitive slave occu¬ 
pies the forefront, the American musi¬ 


cian is the Negro. In science, philoso¬ 
phy, medicine, law and constructive 
statesmanship, and unflinching cour¬ 
age and gallantry on the field of bat¬ 
tle, the Negro is inseparably linked 
with all that is great and grand in 
this country’s history. As a believer 
in the doctrine set fortn in the ser¬ 
mon on the mount the negro alone 
stands for America. 

Earth bids farewell to all that is 
mortal of Dunbar, but the sweetness 
of his soul in the songs he has sung 
will ever live to bless the children of 
men. A race that in spite of innum¬ 
erable handicaps produced, Toussaint 
L’Ouverture, the founder of a state, 
Bishop Allen the founder of a church. 
Frederick Douglass, the founder of 
Negro citizenship, Paul Laurence Dun¬ 
bar the immortal singer and Tanner 
the world-renowned painter need have 
no fears for the future.

Why Gov. Vardaman Should Be Sent 
to the U. S. Senate. 

Gov. Vardaman, who is candidate 
for United States senator was, says 
the Colored American magazine, a con¬ 
vict guard twelve years, and for years 
has sustained illigitimate relations 
with the worst element of degenerate 
women at Greenwood, his home city, 
bases his estimate of Negroes on the 
vicious class with whom he has asso¬ 
ciated. Vardaman wants to go to the 
U. S. Senate and is in a position to 
gratify his ambition. The convict 
guard element, the overseers or plan¬ 
tation whipping bosses, who whip, 
lynch and burn Negro men and seduce 
their wives and daughters, are in the 
saddle in Mississippi, and will send 
Vardaman to the Senate. This we 
trust they will do, for the reason that 
his elevation to the U. S. Senate would 
lift him off the backs of the law-abid¬ 
ing mob ridden Negroes of Mississ¬ 
ippi and load him on to the white 
Americans whose winkings at crime 
made the Tillmans and Vardanians 
possible. It is indeed unreasonable 
to suppose that mobs and convict 
guards in control of states will deny 
themselves representation in the 
United States Senate. Furthermore 
his elevation to the Senate would 
lessen his power for evil towards the 
Negroes. If all the Vardamans and 
Tillmans in the South could be ele¬ 
vated to the U. S. Senate, it would be 
a blessing in disguise. 

Vardaman’s change of tactics in re¬ 
gard to negro schools, is the result of 
recent information he has gained on 
the subject. His first proposition was 
to divide the school fund between the 
races, basing the division on the pro¬ 
portion of taxes paid by the Negroes 
on the one hand and by all other ele¬ 
ments on the other. Judge Critz and 


Senator Noel, both of whom contested 
the nomination for the governorship 
with Vadaman, investigated the 
amount of taxes paid by the negroes 
and told the whites of that state if 
such a dangerous law was enacted the 
Negroes would receive more of the 
school funds than they were receiving 
at present. Hence Vandaman's change. 
What a humilating position for the 
superior race in Mississippi. 

By all means let every lyncher, Ne¬ 
gro burner, plantation whipping bosses 
or ravishers of Negro girls, and hat¬ 
ers of justice, send their chief, J. K. 
Vardaman, the insulter of the Presi¬ 
dent’s mother, a high-toned Southern 
lady- to the United States Senate. 
He is the legitimate offspring of our 
present national policy of acquiesence 
in the nullification of the federal con¬ 
stitution in the Southern States. 

MAJOR ALLENSWORTH 
Is delivering a series of lectures to 
the Sunday school children that are 
not only instructive to the young but 
inspiring to all who hear them. Every 
colored Sunday school in Southern 
California ought to hear these lec¬ 
tures. They can be heard and heard 
again with profit and interest. The 
major, who is a retried army officer 
with a salary of $3000 per year, is de¬ 
voting his entire time and energies to 
uplifting the race. He is a man of 
large experience, a happy entertaining 
speaker who carries his audience with 
him. 

War with China? The attempt to 
force Chinamen to trade with Ameri¬ 
cans is making the big stick too com¬ 
mon. Prominent Chinamen say that 
the whole thing is a bluff. We have 
seen negroes whipped and even killed 
for not trading at the plantation store, 
but we didn’t expect to see the nation 
reduced to such a godless level. When 
a Christian nation sets out to kill off 
a pagan nation for an opportunity to 
worship the pagan’s God (gold) that 
God is supplanting all other Gods. 

Too many colored~people are stop¬ 
ping in the cities. What the race 
needs now, is more acreage and less 
•city lots. On two acres of land a 
small family can make an independent 
living. There is room, freedom and 
wealth for a hundred colored farmers 
to raise vegetables for this city alone. 

* * * 

The only way to instill race pride 
in your children is to have them read 
race papers, race books and race his¬ 
tory. If your children have no race 
pride they will have no personal pride. 
They cannot have race pride without 
a knowledge of the race's achieve¬ 
ments; the only way this knowledge 
can be obtained is by reading race 
literature. The only way to develop 
race literature is to pay for it.

THE UNKNOVvN. 

(Written for the Liberator.) 

I’ve asked these questions oft in vain, 
If after death we’ll live again? 

After the earthly twilight glow 
Will endless dawn illumine our brow? 

Is there a land beyond the tomb, 
Where lilies and sweet ro n es bloom? 
Some mystics empire o’er the way, 
Where night gives place to endless 
day? 

Is there a green, Elysian shore. 
Where we shall dwell forevermore? 
When life and earthly joys have fled, 
Will white-winged Peace its pinions 
spread? 

When loved ones have faded from our 
sight, 

We said good night, sweet dreams, 
good night, 

Beyond this world of strife and pain, 
Hope whispers we shall meet again. 

Life and love like flowers will fade, 
No voices answer from the dead, 

Our friends pass over one by one. 
Into the realms of the Unknown.

MR. GEO. W. DENNIS, JR., JOINS 
THE MAJORITY. 

The sad news of the death of Mr. 
Geo. W. Dennis, Jr., was received with 
sincere regret by the colored people 
throughout the state. He was a 
native son, a brilliant orator and an 
ardent lover of his race. In every 
movement for the advancement of the 
race in this state he took a leading 
part. He was loved for his honesty, 
independence and strength. His loss 
is mourned by the colored people of 
the entire state,

DEfATH OF MRS. A. THURMAN. 

After an illness lasting several 
months, Mrs. A. Thurman died at her 
home in Santa Monica on the 9th inst. 
The interment took place at Wood- 
lawn Cemetery on the 11th. Rev. R. 
H. Herring of Pasadena, her pastor, 
preached the funeral sermon. The 
floral offerings were many and beauti¬ 
ful emblematical of the beautiful life 
she had lived. Her consistent Christ¬ 
ian life made her many friends who, 
with the bereaved family, sincerely 
mourn her loss. Mr. Morgan T. White 
manager of the Moore & Burnett em¬ 
balming Co. had charge of the funeral. 

ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

The Little Delimonica, 216, 21Sy 2 E.

Rev. G. R. Bryant is sick from over¬ 
work. At a recent meeting the As- 
bury Club of the Wesley M. E. Church 


elected the following officers: Pres. 
Mrs. A. D. Jones; Treasurer, Mr. C. H. 
Dougherty; Secretary, Mr. A. D. Jones. 
Everything is now in readiness for the 
big rally April 22nd.

The Moore & Burnett Co., under¬ 
takers, have been quite busy in the 
last few days, having charge of five 
funerals. One of the funerals was 
that of a white child. The services 
rendered by the company on these 
sad occasions is very satisfactory to 
all, so much so that there is an in- 
crweasing demand for them.

DON'T FAIL TO HEAR HIM. 

Mr. G. LeForest Wood, imperson¬ 
ator, story teller and dialect reader 
will give an entertainment at Wesley 
Chapel M. E. Church Tuesday even¬

Major Allensworth visited Sawtell on 
the 15th, looking over real estate in 
that prosperous locality. While he 
was there he was the guest of the 
editor, who took the Major for a drive 
to the Soldiers’ Home, West Gate and 
Santa Monica. At the Home the Ma¬ 
jor was cordially received by the Ad¬ 
jutant, the Governor being absent. 
After looking over the country, listing 
much real estate, the Major returned 
to the city well pleased with Sawtelle. 
He represents the California Invest¬ 
ment Co. of which he is manager. 


A NOTED LECTURER. 

Major Allen Allensworth, of Los 
Angeles, made a visit to Sawtelle last 
Thursday afternoon, and in company 
with Mr. J. L. Edmonds, paid the Sen¬ 
tinel a call. The Major intends to be¬ 
come a resident of this place in the 
near future. He also promised that 
he will give the people of Sawtelle a 
lecture at no distant date. He is an 
old time friend of Capt. B. F. Leeds 
of this place, who was very much de¬ 
lighted when he saw the Major once 
more. 

Major Allensworth is an eloquent 
speaker, a logical conversationalist 
and an entertainer, always pleasant 
and judicious in his talk, and original 
if not unique in his selection of sub¬ 
jects for the lecture platform. Let’s 
eagerly wait for him.—Sawtelle Sen¬ 
tinel. 


DRUG STORE. 

The efforts of Drs. Nelson, Johnson 
and Garrot to start a drug store is a 
move in the right direction. We trust 


that our other colored physicians will 
give the matter their hearty support. A 
drug store owned and conducted by 
the colored people is badly needed. 
The proposition is popular with the 
masses, and if a company is organized 
its stock would find ready purchasers 
among our people. We would be 
pleased to see Dr. M. E. Sykes assist 
in this enterprise as he is worth $50,- 
000, and his participation would lend 
it great impetus. Organize a company 
gentlemen. 


MRS. BOOKER T. WASHINGTON. 

Wife of the distinguished educator 
of that name, has returned to Tuske- 
gon after spending a few pleasant 
days in this city. She was the hon¬ 
ored guest of the Friday Morning Club 
the swellest white club in the city. 
She was also a guest of some of the 
best white families. Her addresses 
were all well received. The address 
she delivered at Wesley Chapel M. E. 
church was great. Mrs. Washington 
is a native of Noxuby county, Miss., 
the county in which the editor of this 
journal was reared.
