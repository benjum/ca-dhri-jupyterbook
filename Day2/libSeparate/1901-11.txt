What Rev. Rdwards Saw in 
Gay “Paree.” 

AN AMERICAN SIGHT SEEING IN 
PARIS. 


Leaving London at 8 p. m. after a 
few hours ride we find ourselves in 
Southampton, where we take steamer 
for Havre. The morning light brings 
us in sight of French soil. Landing, 
we find ourselves in the hands of the 
custom officer, who at this port is a 
woman, who with her assistants go 
through our baggage in search of ci¬ 
gars, wines, tobacco, matches or whis¬ 
key. Nothing being discovered we are 
allowed to pass. Hastening through 
the city by transfer, we are soon seated 
on the “Oust” railroad en route to 
Paris. About 12 o’clock noon, after 
a lovely ride up the valley of the Seine 
we arrive at the depot in Paris. We 
are conducted to the Wesleyan mis¬ 
sion house by a brotherly Englishman, 
who is in charge of the work. A 
newly made friend conducts us to the 
Salvation Army headquarters, where 
we dined. Upon entering the court 
which leads to the building we notice 
the words, “Solut Armie.” Although 
a Methodist and in a strange land, we 
felt perfectly at home in the hands of 
the army. 

After dinner we are out sightseeing. 
The Madeleine, a superb classic edifice, 
was begun in 1764 by Louis XV. It 
was designed after the style of the 
Pantheon, but the architect, Courture, 
who succeeded Constant d’lvry in 
1777, reverted to the earlier Greek 
order of architecture. After many at¬ 
tempts at work to complete it tht 
building was finally completed in 1842 
at a cost of £520,000, or $2,600,000. The 
beautifully carved figures over the 
front entrance represent the Last 
Judgment, designed by Lemaire. 

Upon the bronze doors are groups 
illustrating the Ten Commandments. 

During the civil war, which suc¬ 
ceeded the siege of Paris, the Madeleine 


was in great danger. A barricade was 
erected by the insurgents across the 
Rue Royale, immediately in front of 
the church, and in the conflict between 
the troops of the republic and the 
commune many houses were burned 
down and many others much injured 
by shells and bullets. The Versailles 
army finally prevailed and many in¬ 
surgents sought refuge in the Made¬ 
leine, but were killed on the spot. The 
musical service is said to be very fine. 

Place de Concorde is said to be the 
finest place not only in Paris,but in the 
whole of Europe. It is situated be¬ 
tween the Gardens of Tuilleries and 
the Champs Elysees. 

From the center of the place, where 
stands the obelisk of Luxor, sister mon¬ 
olith to Cleopatra’s Needle, can be seen 
the Arc de Triomphe,the Madeleine,the 
Louvre, the House of Commons and 
many other fine public buildings. 
Champs Elysees, a most beautiful 
promenade, laid out with elms and 
limes, is a scene of great animation be¬ 
tween the hours of 2 and 6 p. m. At 
the head of this avenue is Arc de 
Triomphe, the finest triumphal arch in 
existence. It was designed by Chal- 
grin for Napoleon I in 1806 and was 
completed in 1836 by Louis Philippe 
at a cost of £400,000, or $2,000,000. It 
is 160 feet high, 146 feet broad and 76 
feet deep. 

From the top of this arch may be 
had- an excellent view of Paris. The 
great avenues, twelve in number, ra¬ 
diate from this center, forming a pic¬ 
ture not unlike the spokes extending 
from the hub of a wheel. A beautiful 
view of the city and some of its mag¬ 
nificent avenues is enjoyed from the 
top of a bus or street car as we go east 
to visit the Place de la Bastille. Here 
formerly stood the massive castle of 
the Bastille St. Antoine, which was 
erected by Charles Y. and Charles VI. 
and was eventually used as a state 
prison. The fall of the Bastille is one 
of the most familiar events in the his¬ 
tory of France. A few minutes walk 
from the Bastille brings us to the 


beautiful river Seine. Here we cross 
over Pont Sully and thence to Notre 
Dame. As much time as possible is 
spent in seeing this splendid cathe¬ 
dral. Notre Dame, the cathedral of 
the Archbishops of Paris, was founded 
in 1163, where a church had been built 
in the fourth century. This superb 
cathedral is ;in many respects unsur¬ 
passed by any Gothic building in 
Europe. The chapels of this cathe¬ 
dral are extremely rich in monuments, 
while the carving and works of the 
artist’s hand are of the highest class. 
Among the relics is said to be the frag¬ 
ments of the crown of thorns, pieces of 
the cross, a nail from the cross and 
many other curiosities. The cathedral 
holds 20,000 persons when full. 

From Notre Dame we return to the 
Seine and by a pleasant steamer ride 
are brought up the river, passing under 
many magnificent bridges, among them 
Pont Alexander III; this is said to be 
the finest piece of work of its kind in 
the world. Continuing our boat ride, 
we are soon landed at Pont d’Lena, up¬ 
on which we cross the Seine opposite 
the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Towei 
as a monument surpasses anything of 
the kind ever undertaken. It can be 
seen from all parts of the city, for there 
is nothing to be compared to it in 
height. The highest spire in Paris is 
but adwarf when compared to the 
Eiffel. The total height of the tower 
is 985 feet. It has three platforms; the 
first is as high as the tower of Notre 
Dame and is arranged so as to accom¬ 
modate several hundred people at noce. 
It has restaurants and cafes 145 feet 
in the air, where you may have a fine 
meal and while enjoying it look out 
upon the city and watch the course of 
the beautiful Seine. An interesting 
afternoon is spent in visiting Napo¬ 
leon’s tomb, the Pantheon, the Grand 
Opera House, and a splendid drive over 
a number of the magnificent thorough¬ 
fares. 

Perhaps no tourist can successfully 
withstand the temptation to see Paris 
under gas light, for it is then that her

gems seem to sparkle at their best. 
Her avenues are crowded with what 
appears to be the “creme d*e la creme” 
of the city. The dress is well up to 
what one would expect to find in the 
city that gives to. the world its fash¬ 
ions. The charming beauty of the 
ladies takes hold of you and compels 
you to gaze in wonder at their angelic 
likenesses. The gentlemen, the es¬ 
sence of politeness, are up to date in 
dress and manners. These mingling 
together and chatting with their mu¬ 
sical tongues, under the soft light of 
gas and electricity.give the whole scene 
the appearance of one grand social 
gathering, in which the whole city is 
participating. When you have grown 
weary of beholding beauty and splen¬ 
dor upon the streets and in the great 
and gorgeous concert halls, you retire 
to your hotel and in dreamland imag¬ 
ine that you are in Paradise.—(Paris). 


JUDGE YORK ENDORSED. 

LOS ANGELLES, Cal., Nov. 15th. 

Mr. Editor, Dear Sir: I read with 
much pleasure Judge York’s masterly 
plea for law and order and his stinging 
rebuke of mob law, which he defines 
as anarchy. I for one appreciate the 
high, honorable,patriotic position taken 
by the judge upon this great question. 
If other public men of a like ability 
would hold up the majesty of the law, 
mob law, which is anarchy, would be 
extirpated and the law re-enthroned. 
Then, too. Mr. Editor, I have much 
sympathy for the colored men, for they 
need it, who attempt to apologize foi 
the adminsirtation at Washington for 
the non-enforcement of the Federal 
constitution, more especially when 
they offer the flimsy pretext of state’s 
rights. I notice that state’s rights 
never prevent other than colored citi¬ 
zens from being protected in their con¬ 
stitutional rights. What is the matter 
with that giant of right, the church? 
'What is the cause of its silence on this 
subject? Let us have protection for 
life and without regard to color. 

Yours for good government, 

C. C. FLINT.

Mrs. Grea Lott Tells How 
Her Family was Slaught¬ 
ered at Balltown, Louis¬ 
iana by Cowardly Whites. 
—Other Colored Families 
Suffered the same Fate— 
30 Killed. 


SHE DESCRIBES THE COWARDLY 
MURDERS. 

After a good deal of hesitation she 
began talking in a disjointed fashion. 
She said: 

“Well, sir, it was about half-past 3 
o’clock Sunday evening when the 
shooting began. I was so frightened, 
and my folks were being killed around 
me so fast that I forgot lots of things 
that did happen. Yes, sir; it was about 
half-past 3 o’clock, and my husband, 
my two daughters—Julie, 22 years old, 
and Katie, 14 years old, and my old 
mother, Amy Tony and her grandchil¬ 
dren, were all sitting in the tent. 1 
had just put some meat on the fire for 
I had to cook supper, when I heard 
Grea say, ‘Sophie, you women get out 
of the way; those white men are com¬ 
ing.’ I looked up from my cooking 
and I saw a lot of men. I jumped be¬ 
hind the stove and my husband 
crawled under the bed. 

Grea said: ‘You women look out; 
they are going to kill us all.’ 

“My old mother, who is 75 years 
old, ran to the door. I heard* her say: 
‘For God’s sake, gentlemen, don’t 
shoot.’ 

“I looked up and when I did I was 
blinded by a flash of light, a sharp 
report like thunder. I was not knocked 
senseless, I guess, for I remember that 
I heard my mother scream, ‘Oh, Lord, 
have mercy upon me. I am shot.’ 

“When I heard her cry out I took 
my hands from before my face, and 1 
saw my mother staggering over to¬ 
wards me. 

“The blood was all over her face, 
and was spouting from her arm. In a 
minute more she fell over the hot 
stove, and when I pulled at her she 
slid off and fell over my knees. My 
daughter Julie had run over to me, too, 


and, stooping down, caught hold of my 
knees. 

“By this time the men were nearly 
in the door, and when I saw them 
raise their guns the second time to fire 
I hid my face in my arms, for I 
thought they were to shoot me this 
time. 

“I heard the reports and the powder 
burned my hands, hut when I felt noth¬ 
ing hurt me I looked down at my feet. 

“Just I did look down I felt my 
daughter’s arms loose my knees and 
then I noticed her. Blood- was pouring 
from her breast, and she was gasping. 

“I stepped over her body and as I 
did another shot rang out, and if my 
mother’s head had been split with an 
ax it could not have been more torn to 
pieces. 

“When I saw her lying dead and my 
daughter Julie gasping I could not 
stand it any more and I threw a blan¬ 
ket over my head and ran out. 

“As I was passing through the yarn 
one of the Seal hoys said: ‘Don’t shoot 
that woman.’ 

“The men lowered their guns and I 
ran over across the branch. As I was 
running I stopped only once, and when 
I looked back I saw my uaughter 
Katie fall. The tent was on fire, and 
out of the cloud of smoke I recognized 
my husband as he run out and across 
the yard. 

“I saw him fall, too, just as he was 
near the gate and then the guns began 
to pop like firecrackers. Every one of 
the men seemed to be shooting at him, 
but it was only when the flames burst 
out and drove the smoke back that I 
could see his body, which was lying 
face down near the gate. 

“THEY SHOT HER. 

“While I was looking back a man 
aimed and fired at me. The gun was 
loaded with small shot, and when they 
struck my arms and breast it felt like 
bees stinging. This made me realize, 
though, that if I did not run they would 
shoot me, too, and I went down into the 
swamp and lay down with my face in 
the water and mud. That’s all I can 
tell you, sir.’’—New Orleans Times- 
Democrat.

What Booker T. Washing¬ 
ton would teach the 
Negro. 

"I want to try to teach the negro 
youth to take a high and impregnable 
position. Let us teach him in his sym¬ 
pathies, his actions, to excel if possi¬ 
ble even the white man. Let us teach 
him to dwell away above race hatred 
and race antagonism. Let us teach 
him that love is better than hatred, 
that mercy is better than cruelty, that 
it. is more courageous to receive an in¬ 
sult and endure wrong than to give 
an insult and inflict a wrong; that if 
anyone would help push him down he 
can help push them up. Let us teach 
the negro youth that any individual or 
race that cherishes race hatred and 
practices cruelty is crushing and nar¬ 
rowing the highest aspirations of the 
human soul. 

“Some may call this cowardice. Be 
it so, but it is the kind of cowardice 
that the Christ taught and practiced, 
and is the kind of cowardice that will 
win our cause. 

“What, then, do we glean as to our 
immediate duty and what is the safe 
and wise policy for the future? There 
can be but one answer. On, on, right 
on, with the work of education—edu¬ 
cation of the head, hand and heart, in 
every corner of the South. 

“My race needs the help and sym¬ 
pathy of the American people now as 
never before. I hope and believe the 
black man will not look to the white 
man in vain/* 


THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND 
THE COUNTRY. 


The result of the recent elections is 
not only an unqualified endorsement ot 
the administration, but shows a slight 
tendency on the part of the Northern 
voters to give the Democratic party a 
little while to rest and take a few 
needed lessons in consistency, especi¬ 
ally the Southern wing of the party. 
Its inconsistency was never so strongly 
emphasized as .its position on the Phil¬ 
ippine and Boer wars. While pleading 
to the American people for liberty for 
the two countries named its Southern 


wing was openly and defiantly nulli¬ 
fying the constitution and laws of this 
country and denying to nearly ten 
millions of colored American citizens 
every right guaranteed by the consti¬ 
tution. Under such circumstances it 
should not have surprised any one 
that the American people, the great 
body of whom being lovers of fair play 
and honesty, should have decided that 
the Democratic party under its pres¬ 
ent leadership cannot be taken seri¬ 
ously. As long as the South, where 
the great body of Democrats live, is 
dominated by mobs, under the leader¬ 
ship of Ben Tillman, just so long will 
the Northern voters confine the opera¬ 
tion of the Democratic party to the 
South. There are many good men in 
the Democratic party, as good as are 
to be found in any other party, but 
the Tillman gang of mobocrats and 
“nigger” burners have given them 
back seats. Just so long as ninety- 
nine per cent of mob violence and law¬ 
lessness is committed in states con¬ 
trolled by Democrats, just so long will 
the people refuse to vote that party 
into national power. The position of 
the Southern Democrats on the so- 
called race problem has been one of 
fraud and duplicity and their howl 
about negro domination has deceived 
nobody. The so-called race problem 
will he settled just as soon as the 
Southern people, by the rigid enforce¬ 
ment of their laws, adopt civilized 
methods. Until then we will have a 
solid North governed by law and in¬ 
telligence and a solid 1 South dominated 
by mobs, ignoratn,lawless whites under 
the leadership of brainless demegogues, 
who retain their hold on power by ap¬ 
pealing to the brutal passions of their 
ignoratn followers. The Democratic 
tears that are flowing for the Filipino 
and Boer will arouse no sympathy in 
the bosoms of the American people 
until it ceases to pursue a policy of op¬ 
pression and nullification toward col¬ 
ored American citizens. 


A CASE OF EXPANSION. 

The Broadway Department /Stjore, 
which occupied one store in the block, 
corner Broadway and Fourth, in 1896, 
has expanded so since that time that 
it not only occupies the entire block, 
but recently had to erect another three 
story block to meet the demands of its 
patrons. The new block is a thing of 
beauty. 


A REVERIE. 

I often wonder if Up Yonder 
We’ll be free from pain; 

If on the morrow, free from sorrow, 
We shall meet again. 

If Over There in that bright sphere, 
We’ll reach the shining river. 

If music sweet our senses gTeet, 

And make our glad hearts quiver. 

Shall we find rest among the blest, 
With rosy sunlight streaming? 
’Neath summer skies in Paradise, 

Shall we be sweetly dreaming? 

Shall o’er the sea soft melody 
Our days and years beguilng? 
Beyond all gloom ’midst fragrant 
bloom, 

With beauteous landscapes smiling? 

Shall we clasp hands in emerald lands 
Beyond earth’s snow-clad moun¬ 
tains? 

Shall we rear bowers with fragrant 
flowers 

’Midst play of crystal fountains? 

Shall joy and song and pleasures 
throng 

Where white-winged Peace reposes? 
Will wild birds sing upon, the wing 
Amidst the blossoming roses? 

There is one thought my soul has 
caught, 

That sometimes brings me sorrow; 
And it is this, perchance we’ll miss 
To meet in the Tomorrow. 

With ebbing tide we swiftly glide 
Towards the final dawning. 

If heaven is near we shall not fear 
To face eteranl morning.

THE INDEPENDENT VOTER. 

The election of Mr. E. E. Schmitz as 
mayor of San Francisco recently in¬ 
troduces into the politics of this state 
a new element that will have to be 
taken into future political calcula¬ 
tions. It shows the presence of the in¬ 


dependent voter in a place where he 
can make his presence felt. His pres¬ 
ence at this time and on the eve of 
an important state election serves no¬ 
tice on the party in power that none 
but good men must be put on guard. 
While Mr. Schmitz was nominated by 
the union labor party, he owes his 
election to the Republican and Demo¬ 
cratic voters who have learned to vote 
as they please. In the politics of this 
country the independent voter has 
played an important part and has been 
of inestimable value to the taxpayers 
by smashing machine rule and driving 
political corruption from place and 
power. And his presence at this time 
puts an element of doubt in the result 
of the next state campaign, and will 
make the colored vote, which has also 
become to a large extent independent, 
an element not to be overlooked. The 
colored' voter has discovered that he 
can advance his interests better as an 
independent than as a partisan and is 
learning to vote for his friends regard¬ 
less of party. He has also learned that 
his brethren are lynched and disfran¬ 
chised and it matters not which party 
is in power at Washington. To the 
negro it is of vastly more importance 
who is governor of his state than who 
is president of the United States. What 
the negro needs in common with his 
other fellow citizens is pure,capable 
men for public office. In local elections 
if the men put forward by the Repub¬ 
licans will treat you with the same 
consideration regarding your rights as 
they do other citizens, vote for them; 
if you are convinced that they will do 
otherwise, vote against them. A good 
American citizen never votes for a 
party because he believes it will win, 
but because he believes it is right. 


WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER OF NE¬ 
GROES IN LOUISIANA. 


The wholesale slaughter of thirty col¬ 
ored men, women and children at Ball- 
town, La., on the Sabbath of October 
27th, while they were holding a, camp 
meeting was a wanton, cold blooded, 
savage butchery, that would disgrace 
savages and would not be tolerated in 
any other so-called civilized Christian 
country but free America. According 
to the report of the butchery, published 
in the New Orleans Times-Democrat, 


the negroes killed were not of the idle, 
shiftshiftless class, but were all hard¬ 
working men and women and were the 
class that make good citizens. Grea 
Lott, with whom the row was picked, 
was an intelligent, wealthy farmer and 
blacksmith, who bought his supplies 
in New Orleans. His intelligence and 
prosperity gave offense to the poor 
whites, who took advantage of the 
camp meeting to kill the negroes and 
destroy their property. Defenseless 
women and children, fleeing from the 
scene of the slaughter, were shot down 
with no more consideration than 
would be given mad dogs. If Lott had 
traded with the local merchants, pay¬ 
ing three prices for bis supplies, he 
would have been considered a good 
"nigger” and the cold-blooded* slaugh¬ 
ter perhaps been averted. 

The God that reigned over Babylon 
is the God that is reigning now, and 
will require the blood of these inno¬ 
cent, defenseless victims at the hands 
of the whole American people. In their 
chase for gold the American people 
have forgotten the penalty they paid 
for enslaving the black man. The 
Northern people have forgotten Ander- 
sonville and Libby, the bloody field 
at Antietam,the slaughter of the Wild¬ 
erness and the corpse covered hill at 
Gettysburg are faded memories. The 
war prophecy of immortal Lincoln was 
fulfilled, and all of the wealth piled up 
by the slaves, two hundred and fifty 
years of unrequited toil was destroyed 
in the late civil war, and every drop 
of blood drawn by the lash was paid- 
for by one drawn by the sword. God 
knows the full measure of our suffer¬ 
ing and oppression in this country. He 
has numbered every drop of our blood 
that has been shed by American mobs 
with the consent of the American peo¬ 
ple, and He will have another day of 
reckoning, if there is any punishment 
for sin. We are taxed without repre¬ 
sentation, denied trial by jury when 
charged with offenses and our men, 
women and children are murdered as 
a pastime by lawless men, who are not 
even arrested, much less tried. 

While we must remain firm in our 
faith in God and in our obedience to 
the laws, let us like Grea Lott, make a 
Winchester rifle a part of our furniture 
and when a mob attacks our cabin 
take one or two with us to heaven’s 
court. The color of the skin will cut 
no figure there.

THE LIBERATOR. 


TWO MISSISSIPPI WHITE MEN 
BURNED. 

On the 16th :inst. Will Mathis mur¬ 
dered. two United States deputy mar¬ 
shals and burned their bodies in Pon¬ 
totoc county, Miss. Mathis was 
charged with conterfeiting and making 
illicit whiskey. The man witness 
against him in the counterfeiting 
charge was a colored man, whom he 
killed or had it done a month ago. For 
killing the negro witness neither the 
state or federal authorities were likely 
to cause him any serious inconven- 
ence. But when the authorities sent 
two white men to arrest him for mak¬ 
ing illicit whiskey he gave them a 
dose of the same medicine that he had 
given the negro, with a little fire added. 
Now, if he had been arrested and 
lodged in jail for killing the negro 
the lives, of the white men would have 
been saved and the majesty of the law 
upheld. But public sentiment did not 
demand it. The real murder of those 
two white men is public sentiment, of 
which they formed a part and con¬ 
tributed to their own undoing. 

The white people of this country will 
yet learn that if the lives of white 
men and- women are to be safe, they 
will have to make the lives of all men 
and women safe as far as the enforce¬ 
ment of the laws can do it. 

Crime, like the mountain stream, in¬ 
creases in strength and volume as it 
moves. Mathis, who knew he ran no 
risk in killing a colored witness, did 
not scruple to kill white ones, even 
though they were Federal officers. The 
public sentiment that condones mur¬ 
der and lawlessness because the vic¬ 
tims are black and their murderers are 
white, is an incubator of crime and a 
traitor to our religion and free insti¬ 
tutions and it is only a question of 
time, unless changed, before our 
whole governmental fabric will fall 
before it.

Elsewhere in these columns will be 
found a very strong letter from Mr. C. 
C. Flint, expressing his appreciation of 
Judge Yorke’s great speech on anarchy 
published in a former edition of this 
journal. That speech was widely read 
and Mr. Flint’s letter simply voices the 
sentiment of the many who spoke of 
its merits to us. One colored lady who 
read it said: ‘‘Judge Yorke ought to 
be President.” 


SOME THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE. 

We would like to see a law passed 
by congress that would put an end to 
all forms of anarchy, the worst fea¬ 
tures of which is the mob. 

TO SEE THE WAR REVENUE 
TAX ABOLISHED. 

To see the Nicaragua Canal built, to 
be owned and controlled by the U. 
S. government. 

To see the government own the rail¬ 
roads, telegraph and telephone lines. 

To see the war in the Philippines 
ended. 

To see congress legislate in the in¬ 
terest of the people instead of com¬ 
bines. 

To see the British clean up the Boers 
so that the natives in the Transvaal 
can walk on the sidewalks of their 
towns without being treated like the 
Boers’ friends in the southern part of 
the United States, treat the negroes, 
whom they butcher and burn for be¬ 
ing free. 

To see the negroes of this city spend 
less money for so-called social enter¬ 
tainments and more for homes. 

To see a dozen or more of our young 
ladies and gentlemen acquiring indus¬ 
trial education. 

To see the colored people learn to 
combine their money in building up 
business enterprises as well as 
churches. 

To see our colored ministers devote a 
part of each sermon to the importance 
of moral culture among our young peo¬ 
ple. That’s what Rev. Donohoo does. 

To see Ben Tillman “go ’way back 
and sit down.” 

To see the idle colored men on the 
corner of Los Angeles and First streets 
go to the country, where they can get 
work at $1.25 per day and board. 


What’s the matter with Brother 
Watkins, the gifted editor of the Pa¬ 
cific Coast Appeal? - Has he lost all of 
his whiskey ads.? The Appeal, if we 
remember rightly, use to carry a very 
large, attractive whiskey ad. A few 
weeks ago, however, that journal con¬ 
tained a strong, well written editorial 
condemning the saloon business. We 
suspect that Rev. Tilgrqan Brown 
threw the ad. in the metal box. We 
know a Baptist editor who is running 
a whiskey ad. full blast. 


BLOOMINGTON, Nov. 5th, 1901. 

J. L. EDMONDS, South Pasadena, 
Cal. 

Dear Sir: I received the September 
and October numbers of your paper. It 
seems to me that the Liberator is put¬ 
ting on airs in its fashionable attire. 
It not only looks stylish in its outward 
make-up, but its intellectual capacity 
is a close second to the more pretend¬ 
ing and popular monthly publications: 
The Liberator deserves success for the 
herculean efforts it puts forth for the 
welfare of the colored race. May it live 
long and continue to grow in popular 
favor until its mission is fully accom¬ 
plished. Do not consider it flattery on 
my part when I tell you that you have 
reason to be proud of your paper,both 
from a physical and mental standpoint. 

WM. WESTENFIELD. 


The so-called Industrial School for 
Colored Youths is dead. The whole 
scheme was visionary and ill-advised 
and met with the united opposition of 
the intelligent colored citizens. Why 
some negroes will persist in trying to 
draw the color line here is past under¬ 
standing. ' All of the schools of this 
state are open to the colored children 
and there is absolutely no necessity for 
this agitation. The great body of in¬ 
telligent colored citizens in this city 
came here to get rid of the separate 
schools, separate cars and separate en¬ 
forcement of the laws; which has made 
life for a colored man intolerable in the 
south. There they have law for white 
people and mob law for negroes. Let 
the negroes who are so eager to enjoy 
the benefits which comes from drawing 
the color line go south—go to Balltown, 
La., where white men shoot down col¬ 
ored women and children with no more 
compunction than were they squirrels. 
The white people of California are 
Christians and treat the negroes as 
men and not as brutes. The negro who 
would disturb the friendly relations 
now existing between the races ought 
rot to live here.
