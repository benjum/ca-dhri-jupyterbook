A Moistrocity Burned 
at the Stake by 
Monstrosities. 

The outrage and murder of Mrs. 
Rena Taggart by Fred. Rochelle at 


Barstow, Fla., on May 28, and burn¬ 
ing him at the stake hy the white cit¬ 
izens of that unfortunate town on the 
29th proved him to be the legitimate 
offspring of the community in which he 
lived. He was a monster in a com¬ 
munity of monsters. His erime was 
fiendish and deserved death at the 
hands of the law, which certainly 
would have been the case had the law 
had its course. Burning him at the 
stake was an atrocity that only the 
lowest order of savages could have 
perpetrated. It was a disgrace to this 
age. It is a blot on the civilization of 
the twentieth century. Where else 
under the sun, moon and stars would 
such an outrage be allowed? What an 
awful sight for the children of that 
town to witness? What good will the 
church and Sunday school do them? 
When will t. ey unlearn the lesson of 
lawlessness taught by that dastardly 
deed? The Golden Rule as practiced 
toward the Negroes by a large body of 
the white Christians of this country, 
and silently acquiesced in by the others 
is: “Whatsoever ye would that 

white men should do unto you, 
do ye even so unto them.” 
There are of course exceptions but the 
majority rules. Truly the mothers of 
Bartow. Fla., are to be pitied, for that 
day’s deed doomed them to be the 
mothers of prenatal murderers who 
will strike down without mercy the 
members of their own households. The 
youth of this country need our sin¬ 
cere sympathy, they are to he the suf¬ 
ferers for the injustice and hypocrisy 
of today. They will receive as a legacy 
the crimes of this generation. The 
men who are responsible for this bit¬ 
ter persecution of the defenseless Ne¬ 
groes with fire and blood, the officers 
of the law from the President down, . 
the managers of the Associated Press, 
who have done so much to scatter the 
lawlessness abroad, like the numbers 
of the infamous Ke Klux Klan, will in 


No. 21. 


a few short years have passed beyond 
the power to longer trample upon the 
rights of men because their skins are 
black. Like bad books, while their 
bodies are rotting in the grave the in¬ 
fluence of their lives will still lead men 
from the path of virtue into the meshes 
of sin and sorrow. THE NEGRO CAN 
STAND IT, for though he has been 
made the wnite’s scape goat and the 
victim of a bitter persecution ever 
since by force he was landed upon this 
continent, he was never stronger men¬ 
tally, morally, physically and finan¬ 
cially than he is today. The Negro 
need have no fear of the outcome of 
his bitter persecution, it is the white 
man who needs to fear. It is the white 
man’s civilization that is threatened. 
Whether the white men of this coun- 
tryare capable of self government or 
not is now in the balance. Whether we 
are to be ruled by the constitution or 
the mob is a question that demands an 
early settlement. To have every Negro 
who violates the laws punished accord¬ 
ing to the law is the sentiment of 
ninety-nine one-hundredths of the Ne¬ 
groes of this country, but they are un¬ 
alterably opposed to having one law 
for them and one for the whites. We 
believe that the intelligent white man 
who commits murder or rape is as 
guilty as the ignorant Negro who com¬ 
mits the same offense. Whether this 
country is to be ruled by the constitu¬ 
tion or the mob is entirely in the hands 
of the'white man. The Negro can aid 
the white man in upholding the laws 
but cannot prevent him from breaking 
them. The right to vote and sit upon 
juries has in direct violation of the 
National constitution, been taken from 
the great body of them. The right to 
even meet and protest against wrong is 
denied him in the South . Gentlemen, 
either the law or the mob must rule all 
of the people. Trying white lawbreak¬ 
ers by juries and Negro suspects by 
mobs can only bring misfortune upon 
your wives, sons ami daughters.

THE LIBERATOR. 


The Constitution does 
not Follow the Flag. 
The Republic can hold 
Subjects: 

The recent divisions of the U. S. Su¬ 
preme Court in the Insula cases di¬ 
vides the people into two classes, citi¬ 
zens and subjects. It is the hardest 
blow to constitutional liberty since the 
foundation cf the government. Strip¬ 
ped of its judicial verbiage it does not 
regard the constitution as the Supreme 
law of the land, but merely a collection 
of rules to be obeyed or disobeyed as 
the party in power may elect. The 
Herald in commenting upon Mr. Bry¬ 
an’s criticisms of that decision grew 
wild with rage, and after denouncing 
him as a dangerous man or words to 
that effect, proceeds to say that the 
“U. S. Supreme Court is the highest 
judicial body in the world.” The same 
can be said of it when it handed down 
the infamous “Dred Scott Decision.” 
And yet the Insula Decision is the 
Dred Scott Decision revamped. Those 
who appealed from that decision in the 
interest of justice were denounced as 
traitors and revolutionists. But when 
that issue came up for settlement by 
the arbitrament of war, every man who 
denounced that decision fought under 
the stars and stripes. The people owe 
obedience to no court that orders them 
to disobey the Golden rules. 

The Supreme Court has made im¬ 
perialism the paramount issue and if 
free government is not to perish from 
the earth it wiil have to be settled by 
bullets or ballots. 

The Court by this decision says that 
“All men are not created equal;” that 
“governments do not derive their just 
powers from the consentof the gover- 
erned.” 


HERALD MAN’S MEMORY IS POOR. 

In an editorial on the burning of 
Fred Rochelle by a Florida mob, the 
Herald says: 

“There'appears to be no question of 
color, nor any line of locality involved 
in such retribution for atrocious 
crimes.” 


If the writer of the above lines be¬ 
lieves what he writes, he either has a 
bad memory or does not read the col¬ 
umns of his own paper. To say that 
burning at the stake for assault and 
murder is not confined to negroes, is 
to make a statement which is at utter 
variance with the facts. If white men 
were not guilty of such crimes 
there might be room for such 
a statement. He evidently for¬ 
got how Durant murdered Blanche 
Lamont and Minnie Williams, 
and then assaulted their corpses. Dur- 
rant was not burned at the stake. Oh, 
no, the young white women of San 
Francisco kept his cell strewn with 
flowers while he came near dying of 
old age in prison. The three high- 
toned young white men who assaulted 
Jennie Boscheiter by turns, then mur¬ 
dered her, were not burned at the 
stake. They were tried according to 
law and given every opportunity to es¬ 
tablish their innocence. The old white 
man who assaulted, murdered and then 
burned the bony of his twelve-year-old 
victim in Washington, a short time 
ago, was not burned at the stake. The 
white men in Tennessee, who, after 
submitting a colored woman to shock¬ 
ing indignities, murdered her and 
threw her dead body in the street, 
were not burned at the stake. The 
white men in Louisana who murdered 
a respectable colored man, then out¬ 
raged his wife and daughter by the 
side of his dead body, were not burned 
at the stake. In the two last instances 
no arrests have ever been made, al¬ 
though the perpetrators of these fiend¬ 
ish crimes are well known to the local 
officers of the law. 

From our memory alone, without re¬ 
ferring to our files of the Herald, we 
could cite instances enough like the 
above to fill a page of that journal; 
but those cited should be sufficient to 
arouse his flagging memory. 

To say that the color of the skin cuts 
no figure when a crime has been com- 
miteed is to handle facts carelessly. 
If the skin of the accused is black, the 
presumption is against him and the 
crime is magnified; if white the pre¬ 
sumption is in his favor and the crime 
minified. Hence, in cases of white crim¬ 
inals, the Associated Press never sug¬ 
gests the mode of punishment; “HE 
WILL BE LYNCHED.” HE WILL BE 


BURNED AT THE STAKE.” 

The above suggestions are made, 
only when the accused is black or he* 
is known to have African blood in his 
veins. To slur over these lynching out¬ 
rages by the simple statement that the 
victims of these lawless outbrakes are 
not confined to one race does not ful¬ 
fill a newspaper editor’s duty to the 
peace and good order of his country, 
nor to society. 

We have no sympathy whatever with 
criminals of any class, whether it be 
a rapist or a mobocrat. Both are ene¬ 
mies to society, the one no more so 
than the other. We love law but hate 
lawlessness. To plead for the enforce¬ 
ment of the laws is the best proof one 
can give of his devotion to the women 
and children of his country. To help 
make the law supreme is to glorify 
God. 


GOVERNOR GAGE. 

The Governor, by his appointment of 
Attorney G. Woodson Wiekliffe to a 
$1,200 clerkship on the hoard of Har¬ 
bor Commissioners, displayed that 
characteristics of standing by his 
friends which has won for him the ad¬ 
miration of all classes of his fel low- 
citizens, regardless of party. In mak¬ 
ing his appointment while standing by 
his friends regardless of consequences. * 
he has never allowed the interest of the 
State to suffer. 

The appointment of Attorney Wick- 
liffe is indeed an innovation, he being 
the first colored man to hold a position 
of that kind in this State. The Gover¬ 
nor, by this appointment, shows that 
he does not regard the distribution of 
a few spittoon jobs among the Negroes 
as political recognition and by making 
its puts all of his supporters upon the 
same level. The position could not 
have been given to a more worthy gen¬ 
tleman, and his friends, regardless of * 
politics, are elated over his success. 


If the new constitution of Alabama 
is adopted as drawn up, Prof. Booker 
T. Washington will be disfranchised 
as he is -a member of two races. It 
a T so disfranchises bastards; now if 
they would go a little farther and dis¬ 
franchise the fathers of the unfortu¬ 
nate bastards the whole convention 
would he stampeded.

E. Sykes, Dr. Geo. D. Taylor; Messrs. 
Roberts, Perry and Maize; Misses 
Browne, Sarah Browne, Bradley, Moore

“THE HERALD’S ERROR.” 

The comments in the Herald of May 
18, under the caption of “The Liber¬ 
ator’s Error,” on matter which ap¬ 
peared in the columns of this journal 
were not our views on the race prob¬ 
lem but the views of “The Call.” We 
merely copied and sub-headed The Call 
editorial in question that our readers 
might have the benefit of its views on 
that important issue. 

Among ou.er things the Herald says: 
“It is the constitution, not the people 
of the United States, that is at fault 
relative to the protection of negro suf¬ 
frage in the South.” 

Now the constitution guarantees to 
every citizen equal rights. Under its 
operation all citizens are equal. If the 
party in power fail to use its prerog¬ 
atives for the constitution’s enforce¬ 
ment, the constitution is not at fault. 
The constitution denies no right that 
it guarantees. The fifteenth amend¬ 
ment says: 

“The right to vote shall not be de¬ 
nied 0 r abridged by the United States, 
or by any state, on account of race, 
color or previous condition of servi¬ 
tude.” 

If this amendment is not enforced it 
is the fault of the party in power and 
not the fault of the constitution. 

When the enforcement of the con¬ 


stitution becomes an issue and the peo¬ 
ple decide that it shall not be enforced 
then the constitutional government 
will be at an end. The mere evation of 
its duty by the party in power to get 
votes is no fault of the constitution. 
The more one reads 0 ur national con¬ 
stitution the more untenable the posi¬ 
tion taken by The Herald becomes. 

——-o-- 

A VICTORY FOR INDEPENDENTS. 

The recognition received by the col¬ 
ored voters of this state at the hands 
of Governor Gage by the position given 
Mr. Wickliffe is a splendid victory for 
the independent colorded voters. Al¬ 
though the Negro vote was cast solidly 
for the Republican party for years, all 
the recognition they received were a 
few spittoon jobs kept in stock for 
the purpose. Of course, during cam¬ 
paigns the “boys” wculd be given cheap 
cigars and marching suics made of the 
same gaudy material used by the Dutch 
kidnappers who did a flourishing bus¬ 
iness on the West Coast of Africa, sev¬ 
eral centuries ago. The editor of this 
journal and a few other gentlemen who 
put the interest of. the race above 
party, held a consultation and reached 
the conclusion that a division of the 
colored vote was necessary to check 
the tendency of the Republican lea.d- 
ers to draw the color line in (.he public 
service. Many members of the race 
who did not understand our motives 
tried to ostracize us but time and edu¬ 
cation soon taught them to treat us as 
patriots instead of traitors, and Ihe 
feeling that the Negro had a right to 
join any party he desired became a 
popular one. 

The result has given the Negro a 
broader conception of citizenship and 
its duties and has raised him a thous¬ 
and fold in his own and the estima¬ 
tion of his fellow citizens, regardless 
of party. 

It is, however, well to say just here, 
that while the Negro has the right to 
vote as he pleases, the right to join the 
party that will best promote his inter¬ 
est in the community in which he lives, 
he should not make the mistake of at¬ 
tempting to make politics his trade. 

Office-see kin’s poor business,” while 
our votes entitle us to representation in 
state and county positions by 


a few capable young men like 
Mr. Wickliffe, what we most 
need and need now, is a few rep¬ 
resentatives in the Merchants’ and 
Manufacturers’ Association, in the 
banking and mercantile business, in 
the fruit exchange. We need more men 
who employ themselves, more farm¬ 
ers, more plowmen, more producers. 
To be a good American citizen you will 
have to be something more than a 
voter. The inmates of the poor house 
vote. To be respected in your com¬ 
munity you will have to be more than 
a consumer.

Edwards, the slayer of Foster at 
Benton, Louisiana, is still at large. 
And since it has been announced that 
he is to be tortured to deatu or burned 
at the stake if captured, it is the sin¬ 
cere hope of every person who has a 
spark of human feeling in his bosom 
that he either make good his escape or 
die with his gun smoking. Edwards 
killed Foster in self-defense, if the 
truth was known, but it is never told 
in such cases. Then, too, the negro is 
not allowed to defend himself against 
a white man in that mob-ridden sec¬ 
tion. It is also announced that Prophet 
Smith and several other colored citi¬ 
zens known to be innocent are either 
to be lynched or whipped severely 
for being on the farm when Fos¬ 
ter was shot. If these negroes were 
not known to be innocent of complic¬ 
ity in the shooting of Foster, they 
would every one of them have been 
burned at the stake, as that is the 
method of punishment adopted by 


southern mobs for negroes suspected 
of crimes. It is a deplorable condition 
in this free Christian country. One 
law for white men, and another law for 
negroes; juries to try white men 
charged with crimes and mobs to mur¬ 
der negroes without trials when sus¬ 
pected of crimes or for being near 
where a crime has been committed. 
Our advice to the negroes who live in 
mob-iidden states or districts is: To 
continue to be law-abiding, industri¬ 
ous and polite; teach your children 
the same lessons, but keep a good 
\\ inchester rifle in your home and use 
it upon any person or poisons who at¬ 
tempts to enter it for unlawful pur¬ 
poses. The negroes have been put 
outside of the pale of humanity and 
will therelore have to protect them¬ 
selves. Since the war 40,000 negroes 
have been butchered in the south by 
mobs. Until recently the mobs dis¬ 
posed of the negroes by the more hu¬ 
mane method of the rope and bullet, 
but that is considered too good now, 
so the stake has been adopted. 

Later: Rev Smith and MacLand 

have both been hanged by a mob. The 
sheriff kept them till the mob got ready 
to murder them. Their innocence was 
established, but they had to die, just 
the same.

MR. G. WuODSON WICKLIFFE. 

Mr. Wickliffe’s good fortune in re¬ 
ceiving an appointment on the board 
of Harbor Commissioners is a 
source of much gratification to his fel¬ 
low citizens. We dare say that no ap¬ 
pointment made by the Governor has 
given more general satisfaction than 
this one. 

His painstaking method of handling 
matters entrusted to his care and hi* 
gentlemanly demeanor have won for 
him the confidence and respect of all 
who knew him.

SHALL THEIR HOME BE SOLD? 

On account of sickness the home of 
Mrs. Ruth Brown Thompson, daughter 
of John Brown, the Liberator, is in 
danger of being sold to satisfy a mort¬ 
gage. This mortgage was given to se¬ 
cure money to assist them during a se¬ 
vere illness of Mrs. Thompson, who is 
72 years old. Mr. Thompson is 79 years 
old. The only support this dear old 
couple have is a daughter whose health 
has been undermined by over work in 
her efforts to supply their needs. The 
friends and neighbors of Mr. and Mrs. 
Thompson in Pasadena, both white and 
colored, are dilegently at work raising 
money to lift the mortgage. The 
amoutn necessary is $400. We earnest¬ 
ly request the colored people to assist 
in lifting the mortgage by voluntary 
contribution. It has been suggested 
that pastors of the colored churches ar¬ 
range for a John Brown’s day to be ob¬ 
served with appropriate exercises, after 
which a collection be taken for the pay¬ 
ment of this debt. All contributions 
should be sent to Hon. W. S. Melick, 
Pasadena, Cal. Your contribution must 
he sent in immediately. 

The sacrifices John Brown made for 
the freedom of the slaves are well 
known and appreciated by all. Mr. 
Thompson, his son-in-law, who is now 
79 years old, was a soldier in Captain 
Brown’s ranks when he was fighting 
battles for liberty. In his youth he 
fought for us; now that he is old 
shall we forget him?

off, for if there is no hell, how would

they are not sinners.

RECOGNITION PROM GOV. GAGE. 

In the appointment of G. Woodson 
Wickliffe to a clerical position under 
the State Harbor Commissioners, Gev- 
ernor Henry T. Gage has given recog¬ 
nition to the Colored citizens of Cali¬ 
fornia that all will no doubt appreciate. 
He departs from the beaten path of 
his predecessors, and, besides display¬ 
ing force of character, shows that he 
is broad-minded and liberal enough to 
recognize merit and ability in a befit¬ 
ting manner, and he could not have 
selected from our ranks a more com¬ 
petent and worthier representative. 

Mr. Wickliffe was a clerk for sev¬ 
eral years in the department of the 
Third Assistant Postmaster General at 
Washington, D. C., and besides he is 
a lawyer of standing, and thoroughly 
qualified in every way for the posi¬ 
tion with which he has been honored. 
We congratulate him upon his success 
and we take pleasure in assuring Gov¬ 
ernor Gage that his act will be looked 
upon by the thousands of his fellow 
citizens as a personal recognition of 
their faithfulness and loyalty to prin¬ 
ciples of which he is such a splendid 
exponent. While we have had many 
Republicans to fill the Gubernatorial 
chair, there has been but one Henry 
T. Gage, and he is setting a standard 
for honesty and general excellence that 
all those who follow him may emulate 
with the greatest honor to themselves.

The Hon. Moses Hallett, a lawyer 
of Denver, delivered an address 
before the graduating class of 
the law school of the University of 
Colorado. The closing words were as 
follows: 

“Such was the United States of 
America at me end of the eighteenth 
century. One hundred years later the 
same nation and government, in total 
disregard of the principle on which 
it was established, repudiating every 
declaration of authority upon which it 
came into power, with shameless 
perfidy takes into its possession other 
lands and people, with intent to rule 
them absolutely and with the power of 
the sword. 

“ ‘So fleet the works of men 

Back to the earth again.* 

“This nation, baptised in the blood 


of freemen a short century back, and 
dedicated to the cause of liberty for 
men, now crumbles into the slough of 
despotism, another ruin on the sands 
of time to mark the course of man’s 
inhumanity to man.”—Times.

DR. GARRET, THE DENTIST. 

Dr. A. C. Garret, whose office is In 
the Burdeck block, 129 West Second 
street, has one of the best equipped 
dental offices in the city. His instru¬ 
ments and apparatus are all of the 
latest patents. A recent visit to his 
office brought so forcibly to our mind 
the advancement made by the colored 
people since the emancipation. It is 
impossible for any one to appreciate 
this so well as we who were formerly 
slaves and felt the hopelessness of our 
condition just previous to the breaking 
out of the civil war. The doctor is a 
graduate of the Howard University, 
Washington, D. C.

r I he prompt action of Governor Gage 
in the Modoc lynching and his offer 
of $5000 for the apprehension and con¬ 
viction of the murderers is indeed 
commendable and shows that the gov¬ 
ernor is not in sympathy with the mob 
mania that is now disgracing the 
whole country. It was the most cold¬ 
blooded uncalled for murder that has 
occurred in this state for years. It is 
sincerely hoped that the good citizens 
of Modoc county will assist the author¬ 
ities in bringing the murderers to jus¬ 
tice. 

The cold-blooded murder of an old 
man of 72 years and his sons on a 
larceny charge is so inhuman that 
language is inadequate to properly de¬ 
scribe it. 


Mr. William A. Willyms, a distin¬ 
guished scholar and linguist and class¬ 
mate of Archbishop Corrigan, died 
in New York on the 1st. He was the 
sacristan of the Roman Catholic 
church of St. Benedict, the Moor. He 
was the son of a Viginia slave, and was 
educated in Rome for the priesthood.

Dr. N. Nesbitt of Montgomery, Ala., 
who passed through this city a month 
ago on his way to the Hawaiian is¬ 
lands, where he went to look into the 
labor problem, returned here last Tues¬ 
day on the Ventura. He left for home 
on the Sunset express on Wednesday 
evening. He was much impressed with 
what he saw of San Francisco during 
his brief sojourn. He says there is a 
big* field for the right kind of labor in 
the islands, and if the best could get 
away from the South it would be a 
blessing for all.—Western Outlook.
