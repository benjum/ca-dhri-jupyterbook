“I would take that action over again” 
Roosevelt on Brownsville 


ROOSEVELT “SMOKED OUT” 
ON BROWNSVILLE 


By all odds the most significant 
feature of the present campaign 
is the declaration of Roosevelt 
on Brownsville. Singularly silent 
while his colored paid workers were 
speaking for him. Roosevelt un¬ 
masks at the eleventh hour. He 
declares he was right on the Browns¬ 
ville outrage, that he has been 
upheld by every competent person 
(of course Sen. Foraker is not 
“competent,”) that he does not 
take it back, that he would “take 
that action again.” At the same 
time he claims he did the act on 
recommendation of Pres. Taft, then 
his war secretary. That is of no 
consequence as the records are 
extent. He refers to the message 
of Taft to Congress but that was 
some days or weeks after Roose¬ 
velt made the discharge. His own 
language was, “I have read through 
Gen. Garlington's report. I direct 
that the recommendation of Gen. 
Gariington (not of Sec. Taft) 
be complied with. Unfortunately 
for Roosevelt, guilty as Taft is, 
it is on record he cabled to Roose¬ 
velt asking him to permit a re- 
shearing and actually suspended the 
order a few days. All that is 
immaterial. It was Roosevelt's 
order. 

But the main issue is that Roose¬ 
velt reaffirmed his Brownsville out¬ 
rage injustice, the most arbitrary 
and unjust act in the annals of our 
army. He declares he would do it 
again. That is a direct warning 


and challenge to the race's self- 
respect. It justifies all who oppose 
Roosevelt. 

But what of the colored paid 
Roosevelt supporters who have been 
declaring they had it direct that 
Roosevelt would right the wrong? 
Have they been liars? Let Rev. 
Talliaferro et al answer. 

That is not the worst of it. 
Roosevelt's managers on March 
14th paid the expenses of a mani¬ 
festo issued by Rev. Corrothers 
at Washington which was signed 
by many clergy. It said this: 
“Brownsville. We simply ask that 
you give Col. Roosevelt chance 
to right a hasty act.” And only 
last Saturday this same manifesto 
was published for the Ohio voters 
in the Cleveland Gazette, paid for 
as a Roosevelt advertisement. 
Roosevelt has been getting colored 
votes on false pretenses.

ROOSEVELT’S STATEMENT IN 
BROWNSVILLE 

(Boston Post, May 16, 1912.) 
In speaking at Kenton, Ohio, 
Col. Roosevelt said: 

Brownsville Rioters Exploited 
“A certain Lorimer Congress¬ 
man from Illinois,” said he, “who 
is supporting Mr. Taft, as his 
chief Senator Lorimer did; has come 
into Ohio bringing a number of 
members of the Colored regiment 
who were discharged on account 
of the riot at Brownsville. These 
men are brought here by the Taft 
managers to assail me for what I 
did at Brownsville, to try to get 
our Colored fellow citizens to vote 
against me. I always accept full 
responsibility for what I do. 


“I did take the action at Browns¬ 
ville and my judgment in taking it 
has been ratified over and over 
again by every competent man who 
investigated the matter; by tribunal 
after tribunal. 

“I want you to understand that 
I am not taking back by one finger’s 
breadth any action of mine. If 
I should lose every delegate in 
every State in the Union by taking 
it I would take that action over 
again.” 


WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH 


ROOSEVELT'S DAY 

THEME FOR SILENCE 
The New York World: 

DODGING THE TARIFF 
Mr. Roosevelt still has one day 
left before the New Jersey primar¬ 
ies to let the country know where 
he stands on the tariff. 

On various occasions he has 
talked piously on the “justice” 
of a protective tariff and how the 
benefits of it must get into the pay 
envelopes of the workers. 

What does it mean? What plan 
does he propose? Everybody 
knows where Mr. Taft stands on 
the revision of the tariff. Every¬ 
body knows that all the Democratic 
candidates for the Presidential nom¬ 
ination are for the downward re¬ 
vision of the tariff. Is Roosevelt 
to remain the only candidate about 
whose position on the tariff the 
people know absolutely nothing 
definite? Is he a stand-patter, 
is he for tariff revision downward? 
Or is this fearless chamipon of 
the people's rights merely a tariff 
dodger, as he was during the seven 
years he was in the White House? 


































TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


Let us grant this is his purpose; 
the achievement of that object, 
as he cannot but think it ought 
to be accomplished, must be 
through government by the Repub¬ 
lican party. But the nomination 
of Roosevelt, like the nomination 
of Taft, would put a premium on 
government by the Democratic 
party. The West, so dissatisfied 
with Taft, could, with the Demo¬ 
cratic South, give the government 
to the Democratic party. But 
eastern States, more hostile to 
Roosevelt than to the President, 
could, with the aid of the Demo¬ 
cratic South, give the government 
to the Democratic party. How 
could Mr. Roosevelt’s declared pur¬ 
pose be successful with party fail¬ 
ure? 

Yet is it not in the power of 
President Taft and Roosevelt, act¬ 
ing with good Republicans removed 
from the stage of sectional strife, 
which is ccausing such party havoc, 
to offer the voters of the country 
a ticket and a platform not to be 
rejected by the Republicans of 
either the West or the East? If 
they will not do this—if it must be 
either Mr. Taft or Mr. Roosevelt 
at the head of the Republican tic¬ 
ket—then the factional carnage will 
continue to the very night of the 
election, with increasing wreck and 
ruin scattered every foot of the 
way from the Chicago convention 
to the national ballot box.

DEFEAT OF GOV. BLEAS 


Decent people, black and white, 
of South Carolina, should congratu¬ 
late themselves. Gov. Bleas has 
been defeated. He was the most 
vulgar and coarse demagogue that 
has ever come to the front in South 
Carolina. His defeat argues that 
the day of the political demagogue 
even in South Carolina is passing. 
All honor to the white daily papers 
in South Carolina that helped 
defeat this brutal and coarse char¬ 
acter. The colored people in South 
Carolina can now hold up their 
heads and not feel ashamed of 
their State. 


WHAT SLAVERY COST THE 
NATION 


On Thursday something like 
400,000 graves, graves of men 
whose lives were sacrificed on the 
altar of human slavery, were decor¬ 
ated with flowers in token of grate¬ 
ful memory of their deeds. From 
one end of the country to the other 
the people turned out and covered 
with bright flowers the lowly 
mounds, where sleep the men whose 
lives paid the forfeit of a nation’s 
sins. 

It was a good time for this na¬ 
tion to pause in its mad chase for 
wealth and power and implore the 
guidance of an over-ruling Provi¬ 
dence, that it may avoid the sins 
that made necessary the awful 
retribution of the sixties. 

But the contrition that followed 
the close of the rebellion and the 
legislation enacted at that period 
for the protection of all, has been 
nullified or forgotten. While 
flowers are being scattered on the 
graves of the brave men who fell 
in defense of the flag, there are 
those of their posterity among us 
who are, even now, beginning to 
doubt whether they were right _ in 
waging a war that saved the nation 
and destroyed slavery. 

When we hear men like Col. 
Roosevelt holding up General 
Robert E. Lee, as being worthy of 
the emulation of the young men of 
this country, we can reach but one 
conclusion: that if what he says 
of General Lee is correct, then Gen. 
Grant and the brave men who 
followed him—from Donelson to Ap- 
promatox—were wrong; and the 
legislation made necessary by the 
results of their victory, was also 
wrong, hence the acquiescence of 
the North in their nullification. 
While one section of the country 
is engaged in destroying the results 
of the war and committing the 
country to the same injustice that 
caused the outpouring of God’s 
wrath in the dark days of the six¬ 
ties, the other is showing a willing¬ 
ness to make any compromise, 
no difference what sacrifice of 
principle may be involved, only if, 
“peace” can be had. 


The average Decoration Day 
orators of these days, devote more 
time to showing the small differ¬ 
ence between the men who fought 
to save the country and those who 
fought to destroy it, than they do 
to teaching the lessons of patriot^ 
ism. 

“But there is no North or South 
now”—the past is all forgotten. 
To demand the enforcement of 
the Constitution and Amendments 
in the South, as well as the North, 
is “to arouse the memories of the 
war; to stir up sectional strife.” 
This must not be done, hence, 
the nullification of the rights of 
10,000,000 citizens is the price 
we are paying for “peace.” 

Immortal Lincoln said: “This 
country cannot exist half free and 
half slave.” 

Neither can it exist with half the 
people obeying its laws and the other 
half nullifying them. Think 
of the awful toll that slavery exacted 
and heed the lesson. Study if 
you will, the following ghastly 
figures, lest we forget: 

There are seventy-nine Civil War 
cemetries, located in twenty-six 
States, in which are buried 325,230 
men, of whose bodies 176,397 were 
identified and 148,833 are unknown. 
The ten largest cemeteries are: 
Arlington, with 16,254; Anderson- 
ville, Ga., 13,702; Chattanooga, 
Tenn., 13,001; Chalmette, La., 
12,597; Fredericksburg, Va., 15,273; 
Jefferson Barracks, Mo., 11,623; 
Memphis, Tenn, 13,981; Nashville, 
Tenn., 16,533; Salsbury, N. C., 
12,132; Vicksburg, Miss., 16,615. 

Add to these figures the Con¬ 
federate dead, which lie in nameless 
trenches on a thousand hills and 
you have one item of the cost of 
human slavery. 

With the acquiescence of the 
North, slavery existed in the South. 
The North knew it was wrong; 
but wanted “peace.” In the South, 
whose soil soaked with blood and 
tears of slaves, rest the bodies of 
141,711 Union soldiers. 

“Let us have peace”—the peace 
that carries with it the full protec¬ 
tion of the law for all citizens. 























THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


WESLEY CHAPEL LITERARY BACCALAUREATE SERMON 

u Blessed are the pure in heart 
for they shall see God (Mathew 
5-8), were the words from which 
Dr. E. W. Kenchin preached an 
able baccalaureate sermon to a 
group of young people who are 
soon to graduate. Dwelling at 
length upon what strong men and 
women could do., and ought to do 
for society, he impressed it upon 
them that not only moral force 
but physical force have for their 
corner stone a pure moral charac¬ 
ter. 

“What is true of an individual 
is equally true of a race.” 

“If a race is to grow strong, its 
men and women must be morally 
pure; moral purity is the basis 
of all real strength.” 

With great force and emphasis, 
he warned them against the present 
day tendency to sacrifice God, 
morality and everything worth 
while, for money. 

“Yes, God, the church, morality, 
liberty, manhood and health are 
all being thrown to the wind for 
money. Beware—the price is too 
great!” 

The emphasis Dr. Kenchin placed 
upon moral purity, as an essential, 
was especially pleasing to those of 
his audience who see the danger 
in the abnormal value that is 
being put upon money by too many 
race leaders. The belief in some 
quarters that all one needs is money; 
and that everything can be sacri¬ 
ficed for it and with it everything 
sold can be bought back, is a doc¬ 
trine frought with nothing but the 
most disastrous consequences. An 
insidious feeling is gaining ground in 
certain quarters, that if you have 
money or the influence of those who 
have it, you can get along without 
a character. Be not deceived: 
“The wages of sin is death” 

The frequent attempt of cer¬ 
tain would-be leaders to make 
prominent persons of easy morals 
and degrade those of opposite 
characters, is bound to fail. Such 
leaders are enemies to everything 
high and holy; and lend encourage¬ 
ment to the basest passions of the 
human heart. 


On Tuesday evening, May 28, 
the Wesley Chapel Literary of 
Los Angeles, held its first challenge 
debate with the Young Men's 
Alliance of Pasadena. The subject 
for discussion was on Commission 
government. The affirmative was 
defended by Louis K. Beeks and 
Jas. Williamson of the W. C. L. 
and the negative was upheld by 
Mr. Frank Calmore apd Pascal 
Pearson of the Y. M. A. The 
debate was heard by an unusually 
large and appreciative audience. 

Pasadena sent out a splendid 
representative crowd to cheer their 
debators. 

Although the affirmative upheld 
their side to the best of their ability 
they were easily defeated by the 
excellence of the Pasadena boys, 
who showed the result of superior 
training as former members of 
the Pasadena High School Debating 
Class. 

Mr. Calmore was the ranking 
speaker of the evening. 

We hope that more of our boys 
who attend high school will avail 
themselves of the opportunity to 
study debating under competent 
instructors and profit thereby. 

At the close of the debate re¬ 
freshments were served. 


Like a good name, there ar 
things that money cannot buy. 

THE CHRISTIAN SOLDIER 

The Christian Soldier was the 
text from which Dr. J. T. Hill 
delivered an impressive discourse 
at Mount Zion church last Sunday. 
After paying an eloquent tribute 
to the soldiers of the Civil War r 
he likened the Christian life to 
war wherein the forces of evil 
are ever in deadly conflict with 
virtue. He urged a closer walk 
with God as a safeguard against 
ever present temptations that tend 
to lead the human family front 
bliss to despair. He placed es¬ 
pecial stress upon the importance 
of living pure lives, and its effect 
upon the health and happiness of 
those who paid the price. 

What Dr. Hill said, touching 
moral purity, was especially grati¬ 
fying owing to the seeming decline 
in morality in too many particu¬ 
lars. At the close of his sermon, 
Dr. Hill introduced Mr. L. A. Wat¬ 
son, president of the People's In¬ 
surance Co., who made a few ap¬ 
propriate remarks. 


The less it takes to make one 
happy, the more he gets out of 
life.

TOO MUCH DANCING 


A Santa Monica policeman who 
had a penchant for running around 
dancing and otherwise entertain¬ 
ing married women, was surprised 
and shot lost last week by a mar* 
ried man. A Pasadena policeman 
was run out of town some weeks 
ago for the same amusement. 
All of the parties were white. 

Well, when a married man uses 
a gun to break up such escapades 
in his family, he has our sympathy.

BOOKER T. WASHINGTON’S 

gospel 


One of the qualities that has 
made Booker T. Washington one 
of the most useful citizens of his 
generation is his pride in his race. 
That pride was repeatedly mani¬ 
fest in his address in Convention 
Hall Tuesday night. He feels that 
the progress made by his people 
since slavery days is evidence of 
the great possibilities of the Ne¬ 
groes. . 

That feeling of race pride must 
be at the basis of all advancement.

The gathering of the United 
Brothers of Friendship and the 
S. M. T. at Wesley Chapel, last 
Sunday, for their annual sermon, 
presented a brilliant appearance. 
In fact, their meeting has not been 
surpassed—occupying the entire 
auditorium. Everything showed 
to the best advantage. The Junior 
S. M. T.’s were the center of at¬ 
traction. The Sunday school room 
and galleries were occupied by 
visitors. 

The sermon by Rev. Kenchm 
was one of the strikingly pleasing 
features of the occasion. 

The orders acquited themselves 
becomingly and made a splendid 
impression. 


The politicians, who went to 
Kansas City to elect a bishop, are 
lambasting the conference on every 
street corner beacuse it forced 
them out. 

What went with the oranges 
sent over there to buy votes with? 


NEGRO DELEGATES SAVE 
THE M. E. CHURCH 

At the Minneapolis General 
Conference of the M. E. Church 
364 white delegates voted to strike 
out paragraph 260, and 362 white 
delegates voted against it. The 
Negro delegates having the balance 
of power voted against striking 
out the paragraph; thus saving 
the day for the church and human¬ 
ity. 

Paragraph 260 forbids dancing, 
theater going, gambling and betting 
on horse racing. Repeal that para¬ 
graph and the great M. E 5 Church 
as a moral force would be lost to 
the world. 

It was the Negro troops who saved 
the day for the Uuion in the dark days 
of the rebellion. It was when the 
Union and Confederate armies had 
fought themselves to a stand still, 
with odds in favor of the Confeder¬ 
ates, that 186,000 Negro troops 
fell upon the rebels like a thunder 
bolt and government of the people, 
by the people and for the people 
did not perish from the earth.
