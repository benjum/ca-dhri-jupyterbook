HIRAM JOHNSON 
Republican Candidate for Governor 

Eudorsed by the LincoJn-Roosevelt League 


Colored Voters of Los Angeles 
County Endorse the Lincoln- 
Roosevelt Ticket. 

Whereas, We believe that the 
election of the ticket headed by 
the Honorable Hiram Johnson, 
will give us a fair, honest and im¬ 
partial administration, and 

Whereas, We further believe 
that said candidates will be free 
from corporation domination, but 


will not interfere with the legiti¬ 
mate business of any corporation, 
and 

Whereas, We further believe 
that all citizens alike without re¬ 
gard to race or creed will receive 
the same consideration. 

Therefore be it Resolved, That 
we the members of the Lincoln- 
Roosevelt Club of Colored Voters 
of Los Angeles County, do hereby 


endorse the candidacy of the Hon¬ 
orable Hiram Johnson for Gover¬ 
nor and the entire Republican tick¬ 
et of which he stands at the head, 
and appeal to all voters of our 
race to support that ticket.

THIS LIRlSliATOK 


HOW PHIL STANTON 

WAS SLAUGHTERED 

The slaughter of Hon. Phil 
Stanton by the Afro-American 
Council, his pet political organiza¬ 
tion, was the result of a trap set for 
the imes by the leaders of that 
tricky bunch. Like Othello, see¬ 
ing their occupation gone as the 
result of the direct primaries, they 
concluded to make a big killing 
before disbanding. So putting 
their heads together they decided 
after looking over the field, to 
give an anti-convention banquet 
and whoop up Stanton. Sunday 
night was selected as the most op¬ 
portune time to consummate their 
dark plot, as the God fearing peo¬ 
ple would be attending church. 

The tables were set and liberal¬ 
ly supplied with liquid enthusi¬ 
asm. The banqueters itook their 
seats with orders to fire up the 
inner man, and the trick was turn¬ 
ed. A hurry telephone message 
was sent to the Times stating that 
if they wanted to see a genuine 
Stanton boom, send a reporter to 
“Cafe Waldorf” forthwith. The 
flow of eloquence and wild enthu¬ 
siasm for Stanton that greeted 
the reporter made him d zzy. 
Every mention of Stanton's name 
was greeted by round after round 
of applause and wound up by 
pledging Mr. Stanton the endorse¬ 
ment of the Congress and a deliv¬ 
ery to him the 50,000 (?) negro 
votes in this state. 

Now the Times knowing that 
Mr. Stanton's candidacy has been 
regarded from the outset as a po¬ 
litical joke, seized the banquet af¬ 
fair as a splendid opportunity to 
give it a serious turn and big 
boost. Accordingly the Times of 
the 25th printed a glorious account 
of the banquet and the 50,000 ne¬ 
gro votes the Council promised 
to deliver to Stanton. That blast¬ 
ed forever, Stanton's chances get¬ 
ting that vote. With this bit of 
information the Anderson people 
got busy—why let Stanton get 
that plum with them in possession 
of the longest pole? 

There were 115 delegates in the 
convention, 66 from this city, 45 
from Southern California* * outside 


of the city, and four from the 
north. The mere fact that the 4 
Anderson delegates from the 
north outvoted the 111 Stanton 
delegates from the south and did 
this on Southern soil, while en¬ 
joying the hospitality of the Stan¬ 
ton delegates, gives some idea of 
the extent of the killing. 

That the Times and Mr. Sum- 
ton feel like they have been 
through a cotton gin, is not to be 
wondered at. It would make “the 
elephant of the Grand Old Party 
sore.” 

The negro ward heeler who 
finds a white market for the sale of 
corrupt negro votes, will, after a 
while, auction off a white candi¬ 
date. 

Word had gone down the line 
that the surest way to defeat the 
Afro-American Council's vote de¬ 
livery is for the negro to vote 
against every man that has the 
Council's endorsement. T find by 
talking witfe well informed color¬ 
ed men, that the consensus of 
opinion among them is, that the 
entire membership of the Afro- 
American Council does not con¬ 
stitute twenty-five percent of the 
negro vote of this city, or state 
and that the Council cannot de¬ 
liver twenty-five per cent of its 
voting strength. 


Items of Local Interest 

Mr. A. I. Williams, the bril¬ 
liant editor of the California Cac¬ 
tus, is seriously ill in a local hos¬ 
pital. He has the sincere sympa¬ 
thy of the entire community. 

* * * 

It looks-as if the insurgents 
under the leadership of Mr .Hiram 
Johnson are going to free Califor¬ 
nia. Every manly colored voter 
will smite the machine hip and 
thigh next Tuesday by voting the 
Lincoln-Roosevelt Republican 
League ticket. 

* * * * 

The attention of all machine 
candidates is called to Afro-Amer¬ 
ican Council’s ad. published in 
this edition. The Council has 
50,000 negro votes that it pro¬ 
poses to sell cheap. 



ED. W. HOPKINS. 


Candidate to Succeed Himself as 
Tax Assessor. 

He is a modest man, unassum¬ 
ing and direct in his official, and 
all other kinds of work. 

He began work in the County 
Assessor's office in 1895, and has 
continued to work in that office 
up to the present time, acting in 
several capacities, always in as¬ 
cending to places of a higher 
grade, and larger responsibilities. 
Under Assessor Ward's second 
term lie became chief deputy as¬ 
sessor. and on the death of Mr. 
Ward, on September 4, 1907, Mr. 
Hopkins was appointed to the suc¬ 
cession by the unanimous vote of 
the Board of Supervisors. He still 
holds the office of County Asses¬ 
sor, his term expiring by limita¬ 
tion on the first Monday in Janu¬ 
ary, 1911. Mr. Hopkins has made 
two assessments of the taxable 
property of the county, hence his 
work is known, or should be 
known, to the people of Los Ange¬ 
les County. 


The hospital association headed 
by Rev. j. D. Gordon, ought to 
succeed. There should be no 
color line about it; its doors like 
the kingdom of Heaven, ought to 
be open to the suffering of every 
race.

WHOM WILL YOU SERVE? 

Next Tuesday will settle the 
question whether this state is to 
be dominated by a corrupt politi¬ 
cal machine for the benefit of the 
Southern Pacific and kindred pri¬ 
vate interests or governed by the 
people for the good of the people. 
The people are every where arous¬ 
ed and their triumph can be safe¬ 
ly predicted. There is no middle 
ground, either your vote will help 
the people free themselves from 
railroad and machine domination 
or it will help the machine crush 
them. That machine rule in this 
state is going to be smashed and 
badly smashed, there is not the 
slightest doubt. The thing that 
concerns us most, is the part the 
colored voter is to play in the re¬ 
demption of this great state. Will 
he allow his vote to be used for 
the political damnation of the 
good people of this state? There 
is no middle ground. Where will 
you stand, with the people or 
against them? In this the peo¬ 


ple’s fight to free this state'and its 
officers from political prostitution, 
you cannot afford to he against 
them. The negro Cannot for a 
moment ally himself with the 
forces of evil as against those who 
stand for civic righteousness. 
WHERE STAND YOU? Look 
around you next Tuesday when 
you go to the polls and see who 
are supporting the ' Southlern Pa¬ 
cific candidates for state and coun¬ 
ty offices? While a few good 
men may support the S. P, or ma¬ 
chine ticket believing it to he the 
Republican ticket, every man who 
will sell his vote, every vote buy¬ 
er or vote seller, every bribe¬ 
taker, every brothel-keeper, every 
gambler, every mack, every dive- 
keeper, every law-breaker and 
every hater of law and order will 
he lined up for S. P. candidates 
and will vote and work against 
the candidates endorsed bv the 
Lincoln - Roosevelt Republican 
League, the only straight Republi¬ 
can candidates before the people. 
Are your aspirations no higher 
than those of the aggregation 
above mentioned? With such po¬ 
litical associations on the election 
day can you hope to enjoy the re¬ 
spect or confidence of your neigh¬ 
bors? Already the negro hench¬ 
man. of the S. P.. have brazenly 
promised to deliver to Anderson 
one of the S, P. candidates for 
governor, 12,000 of our votes, 
which he well knows he cannot do 
but makes the promise surround¬ 
ed with all the glare of trumpets 
and noise-making possible* in or¬ 
der to frighten some of those un¬ 
acquainted with the above facts 
into its camp. 


Vote Against Hartwell Early and 
Often 

To vote against Mr. Calvin 
Hartwell is a duty of every citi¬ 
zen who would safe-guard hu¬ 
man life, and give to society that 
protection that the enforcement 
of the law guarantees. '‘During 
Mr. Hartwell's public career he 
has ever proven hirnself the guar¬ 
dian of the people's interests/' says 
an advertisement in a local paper. 
Is the above statement true. Let's 


see. 'When he exonerated a po¬ 
liceman for killing a NEGRO hoy 
by shooting him in the hack did 
lie safe-guard the people's inter¬ 
est? The facts briefly stated, are 
these: An unarmed negro hoy was 
ordered by a policeman to halt, in¬ 
stead of obeying he ran, the po¬ 
liceman deliberately raised his 
gun and fired, killing the fleeing 
hoy. At the inquest held by Cor¬ 
oner Hartwell* the officer was ex¬ 
onerated in spite of the fact that 
the hoy offered no resistence to 
the officer and had neither com¬ 
mitted nor attempted to commit a 
felony. Do you believe that if 
the thoughtless unfortunate hoy 
had been white, and the brutal of¬ 
ficer black, that he would have es¬ 
caped without facing a jurv trial 
for his life? ONE MORE CASE 
and we are done. A respectable 
negro man named Perry, owning 
a lease near El Monte, had a 
white neighbor on adjoining 
lease. The white man took a no¬ 
tion that he ought to own both 
leases. After many fruitless ef¬ 
forts to dispossess Perry, the 
white man decoyed him out in the 
field and shot him to death in cold 
blood. Coroner Hartwell held 
what he called an inquest and af¬ 
ter hearing the story told by the 
murderer hastily exonerated him, 
thus turning another cowardly 
red-handed murderer loose upon 
society. The outrage was so fla¬ 
grant that the white citizens had 
the murderer re-arrested, tried and 
convicted and sent to the peni¬ 
tentiary. That he is in the peni¬ 
tentiary is due to the fact that he 
did not take advantage of the free¬ 
dom given him by Mr. Hartwell 
and leave the state. 

Mr. Hartwell will, and ought to 
he defeated, and badly, too, as had 
as he was four years ago when as 
the S. P. candidate for tax as¬ 
sessor he ran against that 
late loyal friend of the 
tax-payers, Ben Ward. Per¬ 
sonally we have no ill-feeling 
against Mr: Hartwell. It is “his 
public career” that we are against. 
We are against his administration 
of the coroner’s office, because of 
its tendency to cheapen human life

by making it easy for teold blooded 
:slayers of men to escape the penal¬ 
ly that their crimes deserve. This 
is not a race question, but a ques¬ 
tion of the protection of human 
life. A vote against Hartwell is a 
vote for the protection of human 
life. Vote against him. 




J. H. De La Monte, who stands 
squarely before the public as the 
only Anti-Machine Candidate for 
the Republican nomination for the 
office of Sheriff, and has the un¬ 
qualified endorsement of the Lin- 
coln-Roosevelt Republican League 
and all other Anti-Machine forces 
in the County, and who is known 
to stand true to the people’s inter¬ 
in regard to reforming and revis¬ 
ing the present system of fees, 
mileage per diem, etc., which go 
to make up the Sheriff’s revenue 
(to about $40,000 per year under 
the present system) and will co¬ 
operate with the Lincoln-Roose- 
velt Legislative Candidates in 
their pledge, to revise and do away 
with this system, thereby saving 
thousands of dollars to the tax 
payers. 

This system, which lias been 
brought about by machine legis- 
latino to reward their faithful 
hirelings, and which in some in¬ 
stances making necessary in Civil 
actions, the expenditure in actual 


cash $20.00 to earn 50 cents, and 
in other ways to plunder the pub¬ 
lic treasury and burden the tax 
payers by recklessly squandering 
the people’s money—must be 
changed. 

The people are fully aroused, 
and are rightfully demanding that 
true and honest men be placed in 
these important offices to safe¬ 
guard their interests. 

Mr. De La Monte is a typical 
American of the strenuous type, 
and will without question, make 
good from every standpoint, and 
deserves the enthusiastic support 
of every voter and tax payer. 



Mr. Harry J. Lelande. 

Through pressure brought to 
bear on him by numerous friends, 
men who are intelligent and influ¬ 
ential, and having first in mind 
the cause of good government, 
the gentleman whose name heads 
this article has consented to be¬ 
come a candidate for nomination 
at the primary election to be held 
August 16th., next, as the Repub¬ 
lican candidate for Clerk of Los 
Angeles county, and, if nominat¬ 
ed, for election in November 
next. 

The office of county clerk is one 
of the most important in the coun¬ 
ty government, and it is therefore 
essential that you elect a man 
who will serve all the people and 
not a few. 

The impression has been given 
that if Mr. Lelande is elected 
County Clerk, it will he necessary 
for the people of Los Angeles to 
elect his successor as City Clerk. 
Should Mr. Lelande resign his 
present position as City Clerk, 
the appointment of his successor 


lies entirely with the City Coun¬ 
cil. 

jin December, 1902, he was 
elected Clerk of the City of Los 
Angeles and has been continuous¬ 
ly re-elected ever since, his serv¬ 
ing having proved so satisfactory. 

Mr. Lelande has never forgot¬ 
ten that he is a public servant, be¬ 
ing at all times courteous to 
everyone having official business, 
faithful* capable and efficient in 
the discharge of his duties, and in 
no way responsible to any politi¬ 
cal boss, standing only on his 
merit as a public officer in asking 
the people for advancement. 

He is a native Californian and 
has resided in this city since 1872. 
He has always been a Republican, 
believing in the principles of the 
Republican party as expounded 
by Abraham Lincoln and Theo¬ 
dore Roosevelt.

L. M. Hagood, M. D. D. D. 


THE COLORED MAN 

IN CALIFORNIA 

d lie population of this state is 
cosmopolitan. This has caused 
much uneasiness particularly to 
the dominant race “the white 
man for many reasons. While 
he is the dominant race now un¬ 
less he shall be able to give some 
more cogent reason than the color 
of the skin he will soon see his 
finish. Color is an accidental 
quality for which no individual is 
responsible or could have been. 
Slavery in this country drew the 
color line and gave the whites 
their boost. This was simply be¬ 
cause their slaves happened to be 
black. There is nothing in color 
or want of it, or in grey or blue 
eyes or length of hair that ever 
made any individual or race great. 
\\ hite never was God's ideal color 
for man. Red, in all probability, 
was the aboriginal color of God’s 
man. Climatic influences, the air 
and the sun caused the variations 
in color of the human family. 
Those whose habitat was in the 


Frigid and North Temperate 
zones were lighter and those in 
the Torrid zones were darker. 
Scratch a white man, or a brown 
or yellow or black man and you 
get a red man. Color is not quite 
skin deep. Its foundation is 
found in the pigmentary particles 
between the epidermis and the 
dermis of the human skin. Our 
so-called white brother was not 
only once a barbarian—did I say 
once? then let it go at that—and 
drank out the sightless skulls of 
his ancestors with avidity. Had 
white been God's choice He would 
have made more of them. There 
is not one white person in one 
hundred of God’s creatures of 
MANKIND ! His dominancy has 
so inflated him that he now claims 
God made this world for him and 
then fenced it in and painted the 
fence white. As to intermar¬ 
riages he claims the right to mar¬ 
ry any woman who is silly enough 
to have him, no matter of what 
nationality and makes the same 
claim as to concubinage. In 
some instances he only becomes 


dignified to the point of exasper¬ 
ation when some one of another 
nationality wishes to marry one 
of his women or vice versa. If 
this be true it may be found that 
very much of his love and respect 
for his women is ba?ed on selfish¬ 
ness rather than on morality. 
Should it be found that his re¬ 
spect and defense of his women 
is based on or results in the de¬ 
moralization, when not the de¬ 
bauch, of the women of other na¬ 
tionalities then he is not an exem¬ 
plar. Stability—national or per¬ 
sonal—can never survive under 
such conditions and hence his 
finish is in sight. Because of 
these things there are many laws 
upon our statute books which re¬ 
flect more discredit upon our in¬ 
telligence and altruism than hon¬ 
or. Concubinage is not made a 
felony while the intermarriage of 
Mexicans and whites, Japanese 
and whites and Chinese and 
whites and colored people and 
whites is made a felony. Shame 
on such pretensions at morality 
or common sense! Those who 
love each other will marry or do 
worse. Would we have them do 
worse ? 

As to the intermarriage of 
whites and blacks it has been 
proven, even in those honorable 
states which have no ‘‘black laws’ r 
that the mark of the beast was 
so indelibly stamped upon the 
self respecting colored man and 
woman, that marriage with the 
whites is entered into dubiously. 
This is proved by the fact that 
there are so few of such marriages 
among the respectable people of 
color. There has been no hegira 
and the proportion is quite small 
as the colored woman who mar¬ 
ries a white man and the white 
woman who marries a colored 
man are suspected of mental 
weakness, if not idiocy by the bet¬ 
ter element of colored people. 
This is not true in every case as 
there are many such intelligent 
marriages. Now, most of my peo¬ 
ple in this state are from the 
Southern states or the border 
states. They come here, like their 
white brothers, seeking for money

and to better their conditions. 
From whence they came, in many 
instances they had but few, if any 
opportunities or privileges. There 
they must isolate themselves; 
they must not be allowed to buy 
good land or live in any neighbor¬ 
hoods in any city except among 
themselves; non public places of 
amusement are open to them ex¬ 
cept it were the gallery or the out 
skirts of the parks and yet they 
must pay the same price; clerks 
in the stores must not show them 
the politeness they do to others; 
public vehicles and common car¬ 
riers must provide separate seats 
for them and they must surren¬ 
der even these at the beck of the 
first white person who makes the 
demand or fight for them; they 
must not ride in sleeping cars, un-

♦black or repulsive or untidy, if a 
servant you may sit there—their 
children must not attend any but 
such schools as are provided for 
tlicm in separate buildings and be 
taught by the class of teachers se¬ 
lected for them; often times th 
selection of teachers is more a 
matter of dollars and cents than 
of character and sense; profes¬ 
sionals, from what ever school 
must confine their work to their 
own people—ours is the only race 
in this country when this is the 
case—they must pay their taxes 
or their property will be confiscat¬ 
ed, but they must not vote nor be 
represented. You cry, “Treason” 
and well you may for this was the 
casus belli which precipitated 
the Revolutionary war, in which 
many of our fathers and brothers 
fought, bled and died. But we 
find things somewhat different in 
this state. Yes, it may be that 
even here unjust discrimination 
is found. As a rule, when found 
here it is the outgrowth of one 
or all of the following reasons, 
viz: (1) because of the outland¬ 
ish uncouthness or the improprie¬ 
ties of some of the “fellows of the 
baser sort” of our race, who have 
become drunk on freedom and 
have made fools of themselves in 
public places; or (2) because some 
poor or illiterate white person has 


moved here from the South and 
has been able to start in some kind 
of business, and having nothing 
to offer the trade except the color 
of the skin asserts this all the 
time and thus is enabled to show 
his race superiority; or (3) some 
one who finds his color an open 
sesame to most public places and 
he wishes to ingratiate himself 
into society puts up the sign, “We 
do not cater to colored trade.” 
Thus it will be seen that we have 
some fool colored as well as some 
fool white people. But all are 
not alike and must not be so class¬ 
ed. The aristocratic white peo¬ 
ple from the South have always 
been associated with colored peo¬ 
ple—some of them glory in the 
fact that they sucked black 
Mama’s breasts and are proud of 
the fact-—and they know the col¬ 
ored people but do not know the 
foreigners. When it comes to the 
last pinch they will be more will¬ 
ing to trust the Devil they know 
than the Devil they don’t know! 
It is not the first class white 
Southerner who objects to respec¬ 
table colored people, but the other 
class who knows it can not hold 
or measure up to the first class 
black people, who kick. Persons 
who discriminate thus in business 
ought to be given a wide birth by 
respectable people. 

Under existing circumstances, 
compared with what we have been 
used to, what is our imperative 
duty? 

(1) We should do everything 
in our power to show that all 
such unfair, unreasonable and 
therefore unchristian discrimina¬ 
tion against the better class of 
colored people was wholly uncall¬ 
ed for for self protection and was 
abortive as a lesson. Some peo¬ 
ple have yet to learn that eticpiette 
is a system of rules to keep fools 
at a distance! This may be done 
by letting people understand that, 
if it were true, which it is not, that 
all colored people look alike, they 
are in no sense alike AND 
SHOULD NOT BE CLASSED 
ALIKE. White people being of 
the same color must not look alike 
but the variegation in our color 


precludes any such conclusion! 
Again it may be done by so con¬ 
ducting ourselves in public places, 
that even he who runs may see 
that our conduct is the most po¬ 
lite, the most respectful and the 
most dignified of all present. 
Again let us, whether artisan, day 
laborer or professional person, 
prove that we are not only worthy 
of that granted, but more. (2) 
Keep sacred every contract enter¬ 
ed into and particular our word. 
(3) Let us see to it that our chil¬ 
dren, on the streets, in public 
places and in the school room, no 
matter what others’ children may 
say or clo or fail to do, are the 
cleanest, the purest, most obedi¬ 
ent, most studious and most po- 
LIBERATOR THREE 
lite of all; (4) that our churches 
are fashioned in tlfeir services, 
after the manner of services today 
rather than of anti-bejlum days. 
(5) As politicians let us not ape 
the pot-house politicians who 
would sell his vote for a mess of 
pottage, but as American citizens 
be so proud of the ballot—the 
birth right of every citizen, the 
immediate jewel of his soul and 
the best defender of his home and 
loved ones—never attempt to sell 
or buy it.

The speech delivered at The 
Forum by G. Walter Snell, Esq., 
on September 30, was the most 
convincing and forceable deliver¬ 
ed before that body for many 
years. His arraignment of the 
Afro-American Council for its en¬ 
dorsements of President Taft and 
Senator Perkins, was a Phililpic. 
The way he handled the Council’s 
brazen pledge to sell the Negro 
vote aroused intense and bitter 
feeling against the so-called lead¬ 
ers of that organization as well as 
against the venal machine candi¬ 
dates who are furnishing the cor¬ 
ruption funds.

Every meeting of the Forum 
shows an increase attendance. 
The discussions are spirited and 
of a high order.

REV. MR. H 

Returned missionary from Li¬ 
beria, Africa, who has been lectur¬ 
ing on Africa in, Los Angeles for 
the past two weeks is attracting 
such large crowds of people of 
both races with his eloquent and 
forceful story of the country of 
our forefathers, is a striking illus¬ 
tration of what a Christian educa¬ 
tion will do for a man, his birth 
and environment to the contrary 
notwithstanding. 

Mr. Jones was born, reared and 
educated in Mississippi, and 
quite early in life gave himself to 
his maker. He was able to appre¬ 
ciate, though a mere boy, the con¬ 
dition of his people and prepared

himself for a teacher in his native 
state. 

This chosen work gave him 
inspiration for further and extend¬ 
ed missionary work and he, after 
graduation from the Jackson 
(Miss.) Baptist College, went to 
Africa upon his own initiative. 
There he has spent four or more 
years doing independent mission 
work with the degree of success 
that challenges the admiration of 
all missionary workers in that far 
away field. 

He returned to this country 
three years ago to study medicine 
that he may be the better prepared 
to minister to those wonderful

The Colored Young Men's 
Christian Association of Los An¬ 
geles, was organized Nov. 1, 19%, 
by Rev. Gloster R. Bryant former 
pastor Wesley M. E. church, with 
T. A. Greene as secretary. Thir¬ 
ty-five members constituted the 
beginning and it has grown stead¬ 
ily until now its membership 
numbers 293 including in it some 
of the best people in the city— 
more than a score of men have 
been led to Christ and hundreds 
have been led to lead better lives. 
The influence of the association 
has been felt throughout the city. 
Religious and educational ad¬ 
dresses are delivered at the insti¬ 
tution by well informed men,, 
white and colored. The growth 
of the association is not measured 
by its having outgrown its first 
meager quarters and now crowded 
in the present home, but by the 
telling effect of its work for men 
and boys and the tenacious hold 
it now has upon, some who in its 
early life did not fully appreciate 
its mission to the boy and man at 
home as well as the boy and man 
away from home. From 14 to 16 
men room in the dormitory and 
the social relations and attach¬ 
ment to each other is such as can 
be secured no other way except in 
a school dormitory—and these 
brother-men, will, as do school¬ 
mates, remain friends for ITe. Tt

ple and should have it. More than

new quarters for the first twelve 
months. 


people who have so long been neg¬ 
lected. Mr. Jones speaks the lan¬ 
guage of four of the negro tribes 
of Liberia, a fact which eminent¬ 
ly fits him for taking no small part 
in the redemption of Liberia, 
about which country we are so 
optimistic, that we expect it in our 
day and generation. He returns 
to Chicago to resume the senior 
year's work in a Homeopathic 
medical college.

Mr. W. D. Stephens. 


Candidate for Congress from 
this the Seventh Congressional 
District, is a big man and will 
make an ideal representative. Mr. 
Stephens is big in mental re¬ 
sources, big in his connections 
with enterprises for the expan¬ 
sion of this city and district. He 
is the friend of the citrus growers 
of Southern California and his 
election will mean ample protec¬ 
tion to them from foreign, cheap 
labor and exorbitant railroad 
rates. His election will proclaim 
the freedom of the Seventh Con¬ 
gressional District from S. P. 
domination. 


Dr. Sherwin Gibbons. 

Candidate for Coroner is an ed¬ 
ucated gentleman and a physician 
of high standing. With Dr. Gib¬ 
bons as Coroner the office will be 
conducted in a manner in keeping 
with its importance. The law will 
be rigidly enforced and murderers 
will no longer regard that office as 
a loop hole through which to es¬ 
cape jury trial. The people want 
a first class physician for Coroner, 
the machine wants a tool and men- 
slayers want a friend. 

The Coroner should he a physi¬ 
cian. Dr. Gibbons is a physician. 


WHOLESALE MASSACRE 
OF DEFENDLESS 
NEGROES BY 
TEXAS MOB 

The world was startled recently 
by the report that a massacre of 
Jews was impending in Russia. 
America was asked to use its in¬ 
fluence with the Czars govern¬ 
ment for the Jew's protection 
from wholesale expulsion and 
slaughter. Before America is 
able to act upon those representa¬ 
tions there comes the news of as 
bloody and barbarous a pesedi¬ 
tion of a weak and “defenceless 
race in this “land of the free and 
home of the brave” as ever took 
place in darkest Russia. The 
press reports—and that by a white 
correspondent—tolls the, tale of 
Saturday's wholesale killing of 
Negroes in Palestine, which must 
cause every American with any 
pride of country or hope for its 
future, to hang his head in shame 
and despair. 

The account of the Palestine de¬ 
bauch, except for details of race 
and place, might well be taken out 
of a history of Rome and the Per¬ 
secutions of the Christians. Cer¬ 
tainly nothing in the massacre of 
Kishineff at which the whole 
world stood aghast and over 
which America presented a note to 
Russia, exceeds this in wanton 
savagery. 

Mobs of white men started out 
early Friday night and rode from 
cabin to cabin calling out the Ne¬ 
groes who had been marked for 
the slaughter and shot them down 
in their tracks. This vork con¬ 
tinued all Friday, night and with 
the dawning of a hew day the lust 
of the mobs for blood seemed to 
increase. 

Negroes were, shot and killed 
upon the highways and in the 
fields where they were working 
despite the prayers they madejthat 
their lives be spared. 

While twenty dead bodies of 
victims have been found scatter¬ 
ed along the roads and over the 
country it may never be definitely 
known how many more Negroes 
were murdered in out of the way 


places where their bodies may 
never be found. 

So. far as learned the Negroes 
who were killed offered no resist¬ 
ance to the mob. 

The wholesale slaughter of Ne¬ 
groes was brought about by the 
report that reached the ears ot 
white men of the Slocum commu¬ 
nity that secret meetings of the 
blacks had been held at which 
plans were formulated for burning 
the barns and residences of cer¬ 
tain white citizens. 

Cruel is the irony and deep is 
the disgrace of the Palestine out¬ 
break on Christian and democratic 
America. Every African who 
has a care for his native land 
should consider the remedy for 
this constant reversal to barbar¬ 
ism. True it is that this whole¬ 
sale’ killing took place in Texas 
and true it is that the murderers— 
as'in Florida in her killing on Sat¬ 
urday also of two Negroes and as 
in the almost daily hunting down 
and shooting of defenceless black 
men—will be turned loose. Bn* 
these redhanded murderers with 
the lust for human blood in their 
hearts, gloating in their gluttony 
for human life, will be turned 
loose upon the community and 
the nation. They will be set free 
as free to settle in New York and 
New England as in Texas, free to 
kill again, white men as well as 
black men, free to propagate their 
kind another generation of lynch 
murderers. 

Teras's whites may soon be ex¬ 
pected to take their proud place 
alongside of Ku-Kluxing South 
Carolina whites who though out¬ 
numbered by the Negroes three to 
two commit more than half of the 
Palmetto State's murder. This is 
the one consolation to the outrag¬ 
ed race. The Negro will not be¬ 
come discouraged and will con¬ 
tinue his progress. Southern 
whites are each day becoming 
more lazy, more licentious, more 
criminal and further behind and 
comparatively fewer in numbers. 

Somewhere, their lodges in our 
government the power to prevent 
such a return to barbarism. Those 
who still feel the thrill of patriot- 

















10 


TIIK LlltKKATOIC 


ism should not delude themselves 
longer than the Negro and the 
South alone or mostly suffer. The 
wound is to the nation and it is a 
most vital, internal injury. Let 
all America before it is too late 
heed the lesson which comes from 

Palestine.—New York Age.

Eldridge’s Hypocricy. 

The introduction by Supervisor 
Eldridge of an ordinance prohibit¬ 
ing the exhibition of the Johnson- 
Jeffries fight pictures, and his vote 
immediately afterward against an 
ordinance prohibiting prize fights 
is a piece of hypocricy so glaring 
and an inconsistency so rank, that 
a blind man can see it. Every 
school boy knows why he made 
his grandstand play on the fight 
picture. It is all right for white 
men to pound each other to jelly 
in the prize ring, but a sin, against 
the Holy Ghost to exhibit the 
Johnson-Jeffries fight pictures. 

The people have had enough of 
Eldridge. His record as super¬ 
visor has been one of reckless dis¬ 
regard of the people’s interest. His 
vote on the Bond sale and his vote 
to award the contract to the high¬ 
est bidder for furnishing the Hall 
of Records is against him. By 
his record he will be condemned.

Firing Across the Color Line 
A neatly dressed colored man 
was seated in a crowded electric 
car headed for the beach. A 
white man with a sickly, tired- 
looking woman entered the car, 
and on seeing that the only vacant 
seat in the car was half of the seat 
occupied by the black man, looked 
about the car in utter confusion. 
Finally with a grin o'er his face 
the white man sneaked up to the 
colored brother and said, “Can my 
wife sit by you?” “Yes, upon 
your guarantee that she will not 
hurt me.” 


Show your tickets! cried a col¬

The attempt of the S. P. ma¬

every negro, voter to wear its 
collar and be voted as cattle, by 
bribery, slander and threats, has 
failed. The position taken by the
