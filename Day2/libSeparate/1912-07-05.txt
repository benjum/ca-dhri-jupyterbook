Does the District Attorney Prosecute or 
Persecute Negroes Accused of Crime? 


THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND 
THE NEGROES 


The manner of late in which the 
District Attorney's office has 
handled cases where Negroes are 
accused seems so much more like 
PERSECUTION than prosecutioh, 
that Capt. Fredericks most ardent 
Negro supporters have thrown up 
the sponge. It is admitted on 
every hand that the Negro vote 
can never again be depended upon 
to save him from defeat as it did 
in 1910. Somehow, since his elec¬ 
tion, the Negroes are feeling the 
weight of his mailed hand more 
than before. 

The costly ''persecution 5 ' of Burr 
Harris has been followed by the 
“persecution” of Morton Asbury. 
Of course no one ever believed that 
Harris or any other Negro murdered 
Mrs. Haskins, but the tax payers 
stood the expense of a costly trial 
in order to boost Capt. Frederick’s 
campaign for governor. 

On June 18,1912, Morton Asbury, 
while coasting down hill on his 
wheel with a white boy. companion, 
ran down an elderly white man who 
later died from his injuries. The 
accident was due to Asbury’s at¬ 
tempt to prevent his hat from 
blowing off thus losing control 
of his wheel. The coroner’s jury 
after a full investigation returned 
a verdict of “accidental death.” 
In such cases the person held re¬ 
sponsible for such deaths are 
usually discharged. But Asbury 
was sent to jail in default of $10,- 
000 bonds in spite of the jury's 
verdict. Asbury is a Negro. 


On June 22nd Herbert D. Stokes, 
a white switch man, was run down 
and killed at a street crossing by an 
automobile driven by E. W. Pri¬ 
chard accompanied by A. W. Spears, 
who were returning after mid¬ 
night from a Country Club of 
ill repute. The Coroner’s jury re¬ 
turned a verdict of death due to 
criminal negligence of E. W. Pri¬ 
chard the driver of the machine. 
A bond of $500 was required of 
Prichard. “This is so plain that 
the blind may see and the way 
faring man though a fool need not 
err.” 

The preliminary hearing was 
before Justice J. W. Summerfield, 
a candidate for the Superior Judge. 

That colored gentleman, who, 
in a moment of silly ecstacy at 
the Fool’s Paradise, some time ago, 
launched Capt. Frederick’s boom 
for Governor is beginning to think 
that he was too previous. ” 

Persecuting innocent defenseless 
Negroes may increase the tax payers 
bured nbut it will not make Capt. 
Frederick’s governor. 

AZUSA HIGH SCHOOL BOYS 
WIN HONORS AT CHICAGO 


Whitted and Jackson Score Seven¬ 
teen Points in Big Track Meet 
on Marshall Field—Colored 
Sprinter Shows Up Other Run¬ 
ners in Quarter-mile Dash, Win¬ 
ning Easily. 

Chicago, June 8.— (Exclusive 
Dispatch.) Herbert Whitted, a 
hurdling and broad jumping won¬ 
der, and his colored team-mate, 
Stonewall Jackson, a quarter-mile 
speeder, who came from Citrus 
Union High School at Azusa, Cal., 


landed the honors in the eleventh 
annual interscholastic track and 
field games of the University of 
Chicago today at Marshall Field 
with a total of seventeen points. 

Stonewall Jackson, the colored 
runner from Citrus Union, made 
himself famous by capturing the 
second quarter-mile in 0:53, with¬ 
out exerting himself to the limit. 
He shot out of the rear group on 
the back stretch after he had fared 
ill the first turn, took a lead of 
three yards, gradually increased 
it to nearly ten yards and then 
let down to a margin of four yards 
at the tape ahead of O'Mera of 
Evanston Academy, Millar of Oak 
Park and Mellor of Des Moines 
came in for third and fourth. 
Ballentine of South High Minne¬ 
apolis took the first 440-yard race 
in 52 2-5s. 

In the track meet held in this 
city last spring, Jackson was cheated 
out of a race by tactics that were 
roundly condemned by many of 
the spectators who witnessed the 
outrage. The mangy trick was 
played by running him on his 
second race with their best white 
runner who was running his first 
race. In spite of his advantage 
he won the race by the “skin of 
his teeth” and was awarded the 
prize. 

The position of hundreds of 
white people who witnesssed the 
race was both pathetic and amusing; 
for, while the white boy was strain¬ 
ing every muscle with his black 
antagonist hotly contesting every 
inch, (the white people) were 
yelling at the top of their voices: 
“go it white hope!—go .it white

hope!!—beat the nigger!!!—beat the 
nigger!!!” 

With no one to urge him the 
black runner kept the result in 
doubt up to the last jump. 

It was, however, gratifying to 
note by the vigorous protest raised 
against the unfair methods, that 
the California spirit of fair play 
is not all dead.—Ed.

A GREAT GATHERING 

Three thousand persons attended 
the alum ni reception tendered the 
graduates of 1912 at Wesley Chapel 
Friday eve. It was the largest color¬ 
ed audience that ever assembled 
under one roof in this city. The 
Sunday School room was thrown 
open making the ground floor one 
vast auditorium, every foot of 
which was occupied. The galler¬ 
ies encircling the entire building 
were packed to the walls. 

On the platform in the rear of 
the pulpit, in a semi-circle, sat 
eighteen bright looking young men 
and women graduates of 1912. On 
their right, on the choir platform, 
sat the members of the alumni 
association. On their left, occupy¬ 
ing the entire Sunday school room, 
were students from the numerous 
city schools. From the electric 
bulbs which encircled the horse¬ 
shoe shaped room were penants 
of various colors representing the 
schools whose happy students made 
up the brilliant assemblage. From 
their places on the platform the 
graduates looked out upon an audi¬ 
ence that would lend inspiration 
to any one starting on life's jour¬ 
ney. From floor to ceiling were 
a cloud of witnesses whose faces, 
in the brilliantly lighted edifice, 
beamed with hope and good cheer 
for the success of each happy 
young voyager. 

The Program. 

The exercises were in keeping 
with the occasion amply paying 
the big audience for its attendance. 
On the whole those taking part on 
the program acquitted themselves 
becomingly. 

The addresses by Dr. Leonard 
Stovall and Miss Ella Kenard 
were excellent and well received. 

The Class Prophecy by Miss 
Pauline Slayter furnished the amuse¬ 
ment of the evening. Portray¬ 
ing the future occupations of the 


1 graduates, she brought down the 
house when she said: “I found 
Mr. Walter Edmonds in the great 
Liberator office working away, in 
complete harmony with the preach¬ 
ers.” The entire audience seemed 
to understand the significance of 
the latter part of the statement 
and went wild with laughter. Miss 
Slayter’s paper was meritorious 
as well as amusing; its brevity 
being one of its virtues. 

The solos by the Misses Wrenn, 
Washington and Brown were well 
received. 

When Attorney Ceruti, who was 
on t he program, was speaking, the 
audience showed a strong dispo¬ 
sition to doze. It, however, 
awoke with a jump when he de¬ 
nounced all agitation for separate 
schools as pernicious. The ap¬ 
plause that greeted that denunci¬ 
ation was unanimous and hearty. 

Had the address by Prof. Frances, 
superintendent of the city schools, 
constituted the entire program, 
the members of the audience would 
have been paid many times over 
for their attendance. It was a 
great address and dealt with the 
practical side of life and the edu¬ 
cation that broadens it, thus un¬ 
creasing the power and usefulness 
of its possessors. He dwelt, at 
length upon the great importance of 
having an object in life, and the 
bending of one's energies unceas¬ 
ingly towards its attainment. He 
gave the ability to “labor and wait” 
a high place among the things one 
must possess in order to attain 
success. 

Referring to handicaps, he said: 
“That while race prejudice was 
proving a considerable handicap 
to the young Negroes that there 
are still unbounded opportunities 
for those who were willing to take 
advantage of them. The soil, he 
said, offers equal opportunity to 
all. Those who return to the 
soil and simple life are free from all 
the more serious handicaps of 
which men complain. He paid a 
glowing tribute to Dr. Booker T. 
Washington stating that the future 
historian would place him pre¬ 
eminently above any man of this 
age.” 

























THE LIBERATOR 


THREE 


The occasion was a great one 
and will be pleasantly and pro- 
fitably^ remembered. The pre¬ 
sence of such an audience dis¬ 
played the interest the Negroes 
are taking in the cause of education. 

Seated among the graduates was 
a young man of quiet, unassuming 
disposition with no attraction other 
than his very ordinary appearance. 
He was Stonewall Jackson of the 
Citrus Union High School of Azusa, 
Cal., who has won national fame in 
the Marathon contests. He had 
just returned from Chicago where 
he easily ranked first among the 
fleetest runners. The principal of 
the Citrus High School says: “Jack- 
son is a gentleman in every respect.” 
Of the Alumni's guests of honor 
Jackson was the most distinguished. 


THE MOTHER'S MEETING 


The mother's meeting held at 
the Lyceum last Sunday, was well 
attended and an interesting pro¬ 
gram was rendered. The paper 
by Mrs. Noah D. Thompson was 
full of valuable suggestions touch¬ 
ing the influence the mothers of 
today will have upon future gener¬ 
ations. Mrs. Thompson has had 
a large experience in settlement 
work in Chicago and will be a 
valuable acquisition in this city, 
where much work is needed to be 
done. 

The presence of the Misses Sen- 
ola D. Maxwell and Ella Kenard 
two recent graduates of the State 
Normal, was one of the very in¬ 
spiring features of the program. 
By their presence and participa¬ 
tion these young ladies showed a 
determination to make their edu¬ 
cational attainments of practical 
service in the work of race uplift. 
Too often many of our young 
graduates know so little of the use 
of an education that they are 
practically useless, even to them¬ 
selves. 

At the close of the mother’s 
program, the Lyceum was called 
to order by the president to listen 
to the addresses of Mr A. J. Roberts 
and Mr. E. J. Phelan explaining 
the operating of the Harding Land 
Co.'s methods in the sale and rear¬ 


ing of orchards, which are sold by 
the unit system. Mr. Roberts, 
Avho has just returned from a tour 
of investigation, made a very in¬ 
teresting talk. Mr. Phelan fol¬ 
lowed with a talk on the method 
and culture of apples explaining 
how the orchardist makes the trees 
bear and rest at will. He showed 
the audience how the orchardist 
could know in advance the size 
of his coming crop and thus know 
what his income is to be. The 
Harding Land Company has many 
local investors here with many new 
applicants. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST 


Mr. A. J. Roberts, who visited 
Oregon to look over apple orchards 
in which a number of our enter¬ 
prising citizens are interested, has 
returned with a very flattering 
report. He says the local investors 
have made no mistake. 


Are you insured? If not, why 
not? You can make no better 
investment than that of taking 
out a policy in the Progressive 
Life Association. This is a local 
Negro organization having among 
its stock holders and promotors 
many of our most prominent young 
people. Read their big ad. in 
this journal, then call at their 
office and talk the matter over. 
They ought to have 5000 policy 
holders. 


Members of the Booker T. Wash¬ 
ington Art Club were entertained 
Thursday, June 20, by Mrs. Jno. 
Russel and Mrs. Taft at the beauti¬ 
ful residence in Watts, Cal. The 
affair was in honor of Mr. Taft's 
mother, Mrs. Heuston, a recent 
arrival from the east. 

The afternoon was pleasantly 
spent; quite a number of guests 
including club members and friends 
of the hostess were present. 

A dainty repast of punch, ice 
cream and cakes was served. 

Guests departed at a late hour, 
every one present declaring it one 
of the most enjoyable evenings 
they ever spent. 

Mrs. Taft and Mrs. Russel, 


are charming hostesses. We 
hope to be invited again real soon. 


The Booker T. Washington Art 
Club held its election of officers 
at the residence of Mrs. Higgins, 
1012 Santa Fe Ave., Thursday 
afternoon, June 29. 

Most of the afternoon was spent 
in selecting the officers which are 
as follows:—Mrs. J. W. Payne, 
President; Mrs. Higgins, Viee-Pres. ; 
Mrs. Joe Olliver, Recording Sec¬ 
retary; Mrs. S. Davis, Financial 
Secretary; Mrs. C. Cobb, Treasurer. 

Refreshments of ice cream and 
cake were served. 

The club will hold a private 
picnic at Echo Park, July 4th. 


BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY 


The friends of Mrs. I. Davis, 
of 1245 Hawthorne Street, cele¬ 
brated her birthday with an enter¬ 
tainment at her residence last week.. 
There were 21 persons present who 
presented Mrs. Davis with many 
valuable presents. A $5 chair was 
given her by the school where she 
works. After spending a very 
pleasant evening the merrymakers 
left, wishing Mrs. Davis many 
more happy birthdays.

GOV. WOODROW WILSON 
NOMINATED 


The nomination of Governor Wil¬ 
son for President by the Democratic 
Convention was a triumph for 
Col. William J. Bryan, who makes 
himself the greatest Democrat of 
them all. 

By eliminating Wall st. influence 
from the Democratic convention 
and thereby making the nomina¬ 
tion of Governor Wilson possible, 
Col. Bryan performed a political 
feat that has no precedent. Wilson 
and Marshall is without doubt the 
strongest ticket the Democrats 
could have nominated. Mr. 


Bryan has not only made Demo¬ 
cratic success possible in Novem¬ 
ber, but has completely eliminated 
Roosevelt and his third party. 
Governor Wilson is an able clean 
man and will attract a tremendous 
following from the voters of ail 
parties. 

President Taft and his backers 
will contest every inch of the ground 
but the division in the party is 
not likely to be closed this side 
of the poles. Col. Roosevelt has 
decided to defeat President Taft; 
that he can do. No matter what 
the outcome of the battle is Roose¬ 
velt is down . and out. God be 
praised. 


THE HORSE THREW TONEY 


“Now is the winter of our dis¬ 
content made glorious summer by 
this son of (New) York” 

Down goes the third term for¬ 
ever! At last Brownsville has been 
avenged and its author will return 
to the obscurity from which the 
gallant black soldiers lifted him 
at San Juan Hill. Back to ob¬ 
scurity goes the Napoleon of Ameri¬ 
can politics—the chief among 
lynchers. The third term cam¬ 
paign inaugurated by the beaten 
rough rider, to be managed by 
Gov. Johnson of this state—another 
candidate for obscurity—will, in 
all probability, defeat Pres. Taft 
for re-election. But it is doomed 
to meet a more powerful steam 
roller in November than it met in 
June. The people of this country 
will have no more of Roosevelt or 
Rooseveltism. 

Gov. Johnson has about reached 
the zenith of his career. Getting 
into California politics at a physi- 
cological moment, the Governor 
shot into the political skies like 
a comet and it looks as if he will 
disappear in the same manner. 
Although the colored voters broke 
away from the machine and made 
his political success possible, he 
has given them no consideration 
whatever, and that is not all, he 
has removed Negroes from posi¬ 
tions which they held under both 
Republican and Democratic gov¬ 
ernors of this state for the last 


twenty years and given their posi¬ 
tions to white men. 

Take the governor’s messenger, 
for instance, this position was 
created by Gov. Budd, a Democrat, 
and given to one of his colored 
supporters, colored men held this 
position during the administra¬ 
tions of Governors Pardee and 
Gage and Gillett. Owing to the 
increased duties of the position 
the so-called machine increased 
the pay from $100 to $125 per 
month. This was too much pay 
for a Negro, under Gov. Johnson’s 
(so-called) progressive administra¬ 
tion, so the Negro was removed 
and the place given to a white 
man. 

This same Johnson progressive 
policy has been adopted by the 
Good Government office holders 
of this city and county. As a 
result all Negroes have been taken 
out of the parks where the pay was 
good and life and limb safe; and 
all teams owned by Negroes let 
out of the street department. 

Lily whiteism in the South and 
Progressivism in the North are 
synonimous terms; both would 
close the door of hope to the Negro 
Both were for Roosevelt and both 
are against the Negro. And if 
the Negro hopes to enjoy his rights 
he will have to vote solidly against 
lily whiteism and the so-called 
Progressive Republicans. 


THE K. OF P. WIN THEIR SUIT 


The decision handed down by 
chief justice White of the U. S. 
Supreme court, denying the in¬ 
junctions asked for by the white 
K. of P.s of Georgia is a great 
triumph for the Negro Pithians 
of Georgia and the country as well. 
Had the Georgia Negro-hating 
crackers secured the injunction 
prayed for, it would have served 
as a signal for the destruction of 
the colored secret societies through¬ 
out the south. It is not the harm 
but the good that Negro se¬ 
cret societes are doing that 
has aroused the enmity of 
the non-progressive Negro-hating 
whites. Chief Justice White who 
handed down that decision is a
