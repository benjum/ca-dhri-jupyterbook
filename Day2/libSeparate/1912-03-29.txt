MORE WHITE FOLKS LYNCHED 

THE MAYOR OF ROCK ISLAND, ILL., BARELY ESCAPES LYNCHING. THE MOB COM¬ 
POSED OF BEST CITIZENS. LYNCH THREE, MANY INJURED. 

SOME DISORDER. SCORES OF WINDOWS SMASHED. 


ROCK ISLAND, ILL., March 
27,—Mayor Harry M. Sch river 
narrowly escaped a mob's bullet 
at noon to-day as he stood in the 
doorway of the city police station, 
from where he has been directing 
the police in their two-day battle 
with a mob. 

The shot was fired from the 
building adjoining the police sta¬ 
tion and just missed the mayor's 
head. The man who fired the shot 
has not bee caught. 

Days of Rioting 

The attempt to kill Schriver came 
while five companies of state troops 
were patrolling the city's streets 
to prevent repetitions of last nights 
riots and attacks on the police 
and fire stations, in Which three 
persons were lynched one fatally 
injured and nine others wounded. 

The riot was started by citi¬ 
zens inflamined by political speeches 
made at a mass meeting on the 
public square early in the night. 
The attacks were principally di¬ 
rected against Mayor Harry M. 
Schriver and Commissioner of 
safety Archie Hart. 

Sheriff 0. L. Bruner has placed 
the city practically under martial 
rule. All saloons have been closed 
and will be barred and guarded 
until quiet is restored. The fatal 
climax of the two day's of rioting 
came soon after nightfall. When 
the toll of the casualties was taken 
today it showed the following dead: 

The Dead and Injured 

C. Kelly, a blacksmith from 
Silvis, Ill., shot dead during the 
attack of the mob on the police 
station. 


Louis Orman, of Rock Island 
shot through the neck; spirited 
away to Moline where he is reported 
to have died a short time later. 

Frank B. Potts, of Winona Junc¬ 
tion, Wis., found dead in a hallway 
from wounds declared to have been 
inflicted during the riot. 

S. Wingel of Davenport, a by¬ 
stander attracted by the rioting, 
shot with a .38 caliber revlover 
bullet through the abdomen; dying 
in St. Anthony's hospital, Rock 
Island. 

The wounded. 

Dr. Alfred Stocker, shot through 
the hand while stopping to adminis¬ 
ter first aid to Orman, who was shot 
through the neck. 

Leopold, shot through the foot 
while climbing a telegraph pole 
to get a batter view of the rioting. 

Unidentified man, shot through 
the leg and rushed home. 

Six others were injured by flying 
bricks and spent bullets. 


NEGRO SELLS PATENT HEAT¬

formerly of this city and now 
living in Detroit, Mich., has sold 
his patent of a friction heater for 
street cars to a Canadian company

WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO¬ 
DAY? 


By Mrs. IVm. IVesterfield 
We shall do so much in the years to 
come, 

But what have we done to-day? 
We shall give our gold in a pricely 
sum, 

But what have you given to-day? 
We shall lift the heart and dry the 
tear, 

We shall plant a hope in the place 
of fear, 

We shall speak the words of loving 
cheer, 

But what did we speak to-day? 

We shall be so kind in the after while, 

But what have we been to-day? 
We shall bring to each lonely life 
a smile, 

But what have we brought to¬ 
day? 

We shall give to truth a grander 
birth, 

And to steadfast faith a deeper 
worth, 

We shall feed the hungering souls 
of earth, 

But whom have we fed to-day? 
We shall reap such joys in the 
by and by 

But what have we sown to-day? 
We shall build mansions in the 

shy, 

But what have we built to-day? 
'Tis sweet in idle dreams to bask, 
But here and' we do our task? 

Yes, this is the thing our souls must 
ask, 

What have we done to-day?

A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE 
EDITOR J. J. NEIMORE BY 
HIS FORMER ASSOCIATEAND 
FRIEND EDITOR GEORGE E. 
WATKINS OF OAKLAND. 


In this busy work-a-day world, 
when each individual is veing with 
the other for supremacy, we are 
apt in our haste to forget, too soon, 
the labors of those self-sacrificing, 
strong-minded and race-loving 
pioneers, who blazed the trail, 
and made possible the magnifi¬ 
cent progress we have since at¬ 
tained. 

It is to commemorate the name 
of my life long friend and former 
associate that I crave space in 
your valuable paper for this humble 
tribute. 

John J. Neimore whose earthly 
career came to a sudden and un¬ 
expected end on March 9th, 1912 
in Los Angeles, was the pioneer 
editor of Southern California, and 
his tireless labors for the uplift 
of the race, he so fondly loved and 
loyally served, have been eloquently 
testified to by representative citi¬ 
zens, including the honorable Mayor 
of Los Angeles. 

Having been intimately acquain¬ 
ted with him for more than 23 
years, having had his confidence, 
as but few men have the confidence 
of another, I therefore feel that 
I am in a position to speak of him. 
In spite, however, of all of these 
years of acquaintance and associa¬ 
tion, I find the beauties of his 
life difficult' to describe. Like a 
Kaleidoscope, the scenes of his 
busy life were constantly changing 
from one good to another, thinking 
little of self, always of others. 

His was a life and character 
radiant with deeds of valor; un¬ 
selfish devotion to friends, un¬ 
bounded and unlimited faith in 
his race, and an untrameled and 
fearless exponent of every just 
cause. 

In the days of his early life, like 


many who have become potent 
factors in the world's progress— 
he fought, struggled and toiled to 
acquire the rudiments of an edu¬ 
cation, being fired with a consum¬ 
ing ambition to lead—that he 
possessed the qualities of leader¬ 
ship to a superlative degree, his 
achievements during the 25 years 
he led the vanguard of his race, 
amply testify. 

His restless and busy life, to 
the writer resembles, not so much 
the beautiful river whose broad 
stream winds through rich and 
varied scenery, but that which 
cuts a deep and rapid channel 
through rugged and frowning wilds, 
leaving the impress of its power 
in the productiveness of the region 
through which it passes, which, 
but for it, would to-day be deso¬ 
late and barren. 

His journey through life was not 
the music of the organ, with its varied 
stops, and mingling harmonies, but 
rather the sound of trumpets wax¬ 
ing louder and louder, piercing 
the crevasses of the earth, and re¬ 
sounding through the encircling 
heavens. 

There was no pretense about 
the man; there was no ambuscade; 
there was no obscurit}'—whatever 
principles he stood for he 
r mained steadfast in their ad¬ 
vocacy. He may have made mis¬ 
takes, no one is infallible. If mis¬ 
takes they were, they were of the 
head and not of the heart. 

As an artisan he builded better 
than he knew, laying the foundation 
(by the sacrifice of 20 years of 
his time editing a newspaper in 
the interest of his race) upon God¬ 
like principles he erected a super¬ 
structure of human endeavor, that 
was blended with all that is noble 
and elevating, and will ever stand 
as a monument to his name. 

His eminent talents, the purity 
of his intentions, the ardor of his 
patriotism, the courage of his con¬ 
victions, his unselfish devotion to 
the public good, are indicative of 
the fact that he was intended as 
a leader of his people. 

If upright character, moral 
worth, strong reasoning power, 
sound judgment, vigorous and warm 


imagination and comprehensive un¬ 
derstanding are essential to high 
intellectuality and good citizen¬ 
ship then John J. Neimore will 
rank among the foremost men of 
our race on the Pacific Coast. 

The pen of the historian may not 
write his name as one prominently 
identified with the growth and de¬ 
velopment of this great state, but 
in the hearts of a legion of friends 
and admirers the name and mem¬ 
ory is indelibly stamped. 

If each of us for whom he has 
done some kindly deed were to 
place at his bier but a single rose, 
there would be erected to his 
memory a monument so beautiful, 
so grand and so imposing in its 
simplicity, that watered by the 
dews of heaven, it would forever 
remain green in the hearts and 
affection of a grateful people. 

Requiescat in pace.

DARDEN & CERUTI ATTORNEYS 
BLUNDER 


That so-called legal opinion, de¬ 
livered at the Forum on the 15th, 
was not only a violation of pro¬ 
fessional ethics, but a grevious 
blunder. If the object of the at¬ 
torneys in question was to encour¬ 
age certain members of the Board 
of Supervisors in their attempt 
to close the door of hope to Negro 
women; or if they intended to 
discourage those who are fighting 
for fair play, they could not have 
adopted a better plan. 

We do not say that that was the 
object of their so-called legal opin¬ 
ion, but it looks that way and will 
prove a boomerang to the gentle¬ 
men delivering it. But, aside from 
its effect upon the said attorneys, 
no harm has been done. If these 
gentlemen had have appended to 
their so-called “legal opinion” a 
statement that what the colored 
voters could not get in the courts, 
they can obtain at the ballot box, 
it would have put them in an at¬ 
titude of friendship toward those 
who are struggling for simple jus¬ 
tice. 

The Forum is the only Negro 
organization that would have asked 
for such an opinion under the'cir¬ 
cumstances. All other organiza¬ 
tions would have known that by 
making such a request they would 
be inviting a violation of profes¬ 
sional ethics and be doing the wrong 
thing at the right time. But, 

“Fools rush in where angels fear to 
tread,” 

But what does that organiza¬ 
tion know of professional of any 
other kind of ethics?. 

Attorneys who hand their opin¬ 
ions around gratuitously, must 
place small value upon them. 

Another surprising feature in 
this connection, is the fact that 
a Negro paper bidding for Negro 
support would publish that so- 
called opinion. What general 
would disclose or allow to be dis¬ 
closed the weak points in his posi¬ 
tion, when great interests are in 
the balance? What is the Negro 


press for if it is not to guard his 
interest. 

The Negro newspaper occupies 
a place of peculiar importance and 
its influence in advancing or re¬ 
tarding the interest of the Negroes 
is tremendous. A Negro news¬ 
paper whose columns are used to 
give cheap notoriety to seekers 
after such, is a menace to the race 
and ought not be supported. 

The same is true of Negro or¬ 
ganizations. 

The thoughtless, inexperienced, 
irresponsible Negro, is too much 
in the lime-light in this city for 
the good of the race. And, unless 
this Negro is put out of the busi¬ 
ness, disaster to the well being of 
the race is bound to result. 


MR. C. C. FLINT MAKES GREAT 
SPEECH. BOARD OF SUP¬ 
ERVISORS RAPPED. EMI¬ 
GRANT NEGRO SCOURGED. 


The speech delivered by Mr. 
C. C. Flint on Sunday afternoon, 
on that nurse-training affair, was 
one of the finest efforts of his life. 
In an able, logical way, he reviewed 
the history of the race in this city, 
recounting its numerous struggles 
for representation, exposing its foes 
with vitrolic language. His ap¬ 
peal to the Negro voters, both men 
and women, to use their ballots 
as a bludgeon to knock out of 
office every faithless office holder, 
who proves recreant to his trust, 
was received with wild enthusiasm. 
It was one of his old time charas- 
teristic appeals often heard when 
he and the editor of this journal 
were making their fight for repre¬ 
sentation in the police and fire 
departments and in the parks and 
on the streets of this city. Those 
battles for fair play were success¬ 
fully fought in the years 1896, 
1898 and 1900. Since that time 
the “eleventh hour” self-seeking 
Negro has come into the city, 
backed by men who have confi¬ 
dence only in strangers, has taken 
charge of everything. As a result 
white, tricky politicians are tak¬ 
ing advantage of this irresponsible 
























THE LIBERATOR 


FITE 


self-seeking leadership to rob the 
race of every vestige of represen¬ 
tation. In the last city campaign 
“the eleventh hour” Negroes rushed 
in and assisted in closing the parks 
to the race; now they are at work 
at the County Hospital. But they 
will not succeed. This scheme has 
been exposed. Flint struck them 
a body blow and the people are 
aroused. These “eleventh hour” 
Negroes being able to attract a 
following as mollasses do flies, 
assume the duties of leadership 
before they are in the city long 
enough to vote,” said Flint. The 
man who proclaims himself leader 
as soon as he reaches a town, is 
either defective in mental training 
or is intent on selling everything 
within his reach and then move 
on. People who are attracted by 
such shameless, egotistic, self- 
seekers, who would barter away 
the rights of a race for a few 
dollars or a little momentary cheap 
notoriety, exercise less judgment 
than do the common house flies. 
The baneful effect of the “eleventh 
hour” Negro's leadership offers a 
serious menace to the well fare 
of the race in this city and unless 


he is suppressed the door of hope 
in this state will be closed to the 
Negroes. With nothing but his 
hat, the “eleventh hour” Negro, 
as soon as he hits the town proceeds 
to tell our citizens and tax payers 
what to do; takes the lead in poli¬ 
tics, rushes into the daily papers, 
issues his manifesto; and without 
their consent, uses the names of 
prominent Negroes. All of this 
before he has been in the state 
long enough to become a voter. 

The stranger who enters your 
home and proceeds to criticise 
your piano and carpets and tells 
you the kind you ought to have, 
bears watching. There is some¬ 
thing radically wrong about him. 
Otherwise, he would wait until 
you solicited his advice. 

Mr. Flint dealt the “eleventh 
hour” Negro a teriffic blow for 
which he has the thanks of every 
thoughtful Negro in the city. Mr. 
Flint is strongly endorsed for the 
city council by the colored voters. 
He has never lost an opportunity 
to combat the foes of the race, 
whether a faithless office holder 
or a self-seeking would-be Negro 
leader. Keep it up Flint; the 
people are with you.

MAN FALLS 50 FEET; UNHURT 


NEW ORLEANS, La., March 
24.—While engaged in covering 
a hatch on the steamship Newstead, 
a Negro named Henry Allen fell 
into the hold, dropping fifty feet 
and landing on the sulphide ore 
with which the vessel was loaded. 
He soon came back up the ladder, 
puffing on a cigarette that he had 
in his mouth when he tumbled 
in. On leaving for home he told 
the boss he would be on hand to¬ 
morrow. 


The most deadly menace now 
facing the Negroes of this city, 
is the effrontery and activity of 
the “eleventh hour” or immigrant 
Negro.
