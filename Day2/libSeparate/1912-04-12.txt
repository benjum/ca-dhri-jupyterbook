Why Negroes Should Own Farms in 

California 


The first and chief value of a 
California farm is that life is as 
safe as respect for law can make it. 
The value of land depends more 
upon the safety of life than the 
fertility of the soil. Hence, where 
life isn't safe, property is without 
value. California therefore, offers 
the home seeker two of the chief 
essentials to success as a farmer, 
viz: absolute freedom in the enjoy¬ 
ment of life, liberty and the pur¬ 
suit of happiness, coupled with 
the most fertile and productive 
soil under the sun. 

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

The next essential, no less im¬ 
portant than the two mentioned, 
is the facilities offered the farmer 
for educating his children. In this 
particular, California is second to 
none. Every community has its 
grammar school with nine months 
sessions each year and high school 
districts are so situated that every 
farmer’s boy or girl is within four 
miles of the district high school. 
Graduating from the high schools 
the State University and Normal 
schools are opened free to all. 
All of the large cities of the state 
have Polytechnic High Schools 
where the farmer’s boys can learn 
the trades free and those who are 
unable to attend the day schools, 
can enter the night classes which 
are also free. The state maintains 
a number of normal schools situ¬ 
ated in the large centers of popula¬ 
tion making them of easy access 
to the children in every part of the 
state. So the farmer who brings 
his children to California owns 
free of cost the absolute protection 


nt by request from issue of Aug . 

of the laws and facilities for educat¬ 
ing his children that are unsur¬ 
passed. 

With these and a small farm, 
say ten to forty acres of land, he 
is absolutely independent. The 
farmer who wishes to conserve his 
energies while living decently and 
independently, should come to 
California. This does not mean 
that he can live without work, 
but it does mean that well direct¬ 
ed labor produces more in Califor¬ 
nia than it does anywhere else in 
the United States. 

FARMS 

The California farmer knows 
nothing of the privations endured 
by the farmers of the rural dis¬ 
tricts of the East and South. 
He has the enjoyment of all the 
facilities enjoyed by the Eastern 
villagers. His church and school 
is at his door, the grocer supplies 
him each day, the butcher and 
baker supplies fresh meat and bread 
for each meal. The daily paper 
is at his door early in the morning, 
the rural mail carrier hands him 
his mail each day and his telephone 
puts him in speaking distance with 
the business people of distant cities. 
Everything his soil produces finds 
a ready market at his door. 

The system of public roads main¬ 
tained by the county are the best 
in the country. So that driving 
and automobiling are two great 
sources of pleasure among the 
farmers and their children. 

THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF 
THE SOIL 

The soil in California is so pro¬ 
ductive that the farmer needs 


11, 1911) 

only a small well cared for tract of 
land. For instance, a farmer with 
a family of five can make a good 
living and educate his children on 
ten acres of land. Such a farmer 
would have time for reading and 
recreation and would not be a 
slave to the farm, but with one 
fourth of the labor, get better re¬ 
sults than a southern farmer can 
get on forty acres. 

A young farmer in King’s County 
gathered 1000 sacks of onions from 
three and three-fourths acres of 
land worth $1.50 per sack, or 
$1,500. Upon this same land he 
can harvest another crop. This 
is merely one of thousands of in¬ 
stances to be found anywhere 
in California. Owing to Califor¬ 
nia’s matchless climate, wealth and 
diversity of soil, the farmers of 
California engage with great profit 
in. almost every agricultural pur¬ 
suit known to the country. The 
fruit growing of this state is con¬ 
ducted on such a large scale, that 
it is engaged in principally by 
men of large means There aro 
yet tens of thousands of opportuni¬ 
ties ior_ men of small means to 
engage in the business with abso¬ 
lute certainty of success; as many 
thousands of acres of valuable fruit 
lands are being reclaimed annually 
and thrown on the market at low 
prices and easy terms. 

COTTON GROWING 

Besides the millions of dollars, 
produced annually from farming, 
cattle raising, mining and manu¬ 
facturing in this state, the intro¬ 
duction of cotton growing in the 
great Imperial valley will add its 






















TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


millions to the states already enor¬ 
mous productiveness. The cotton 
farmer of the south is handicaped 
in many ways in the production 
of his crop. Too much dry weather 
or rain just before maturity will 
greatly reduce the size of his crop. 
Too much rain after maturity 
will not only waste a large per¬ 
centage of his crop, but damage 
the quality thus lowering the price. 
The above are conditions over 
which he has no control, not so 
with the cotton grower of Imperial 
valley. Aside from hot weather 
one of the first essentials is rich 
soil. This the Imperial valley far¬ 
mer has in inexhaustible quantities. 
With his system of irrigation he 
has absolute control over the mois¬ 
ture necessary to make his crop, 
hence he knows no such a thing 
as a drougth. Whenever his crop 
needs rain he simply floods his 
land. On the maturity of his 
crop, irrigation ceases and his 
cotton without danger of rain 
remains in the field till late in 
January. Cotton planted in June 
produces 1,000 pounds of lint or 
two bails to the acre with little 
work. Owing to the absence of 
cold weather, the growing season 
is much longer here than it is in 
the South. The crops are there¬ 
fore larger and the opportunities 
for harvesting are in excess of 
those in the South. With the 
present high prices of cotton and 
the uncertainty of making a crop in 
the South, the future importance 
of the cotton industry in this 
state is hard to estimate. In view 
of the fact that lands in the valley 
are still cheap, the farmer who 
wishes to engage in cotton grow¬ 
ing with permanent profit will do 
well to buy lands in the Imperial 
valley. 

In closing this article, we may 
be excused for partial repetition 
of our introductory paragraph. 

California's wealth and desirable¬ 
ness as a place to live and educate 
one’s children, is due more to her 
law loving citizens, than to her 
semi-tropic climate and soil of 
inexhaustible fertility. But for ger 
citizens, respect for each others 
rights, this mighty empire, this 


paradise of the western world would 
be a barren waste, over-run by 
mobs. 

By the rigid enforcement of the 
law, without regard to race, color 
or condition, California has done 
what any other state can do—in¬ 
creased the value of her resources 
by inviting within her gates the 
enterprise, wealth and culture of 
the world. 

Any inquiry accompanied by a 
two-cent stamp will be answered. 


EASTER SERVICES AT THE 
CHURCHES 


At Wesley Chapel. 

At Wesley Chapel the Easter 
services were attended by a record- 
breaking crowd. The Sunday 
school room and both galleries 
had to be thrown open to accom¬ 
modate the people. The pastor, 
Rev. E. W. Kenchin, delivered a 
sermon in the morning accompanied 
by soul-stirring songs. Hundreds 
of communicants partook of the 
Lord's supper and one infant was 
christened. The children's exer¬ 
cises were in every way an improve¬ 
ment on all former occasions of 
the kind. Everybody seemed to 
enter into the spirit of the sacred 
occasion. But the blessed little 
children, what a picture of lovli- 
ness! One could not look upon 
that living picture of youth and 
beauty, without sending a silent 
prayer to Heaven, that though they 
could not always be young, that 
thay might always be happy. 

One very noticeable thing in 
this connection, is that while every 
person was neatly and becomingly 
dressed there was no display of 
silly extravagance in dress. , The 
people are beginning to pay less 
attention to dress and more to 
the things that make life a blessing. 

At Mount Zion. 

At Mount Zion the crowd was 
unusually large and the exercises 
impressive. The large Sunday 
school acquited itself, nicely. At 
the close of the program the editor 
of this journal delivered a short 


address to the school. He con¬ 
gratulated the young people upon 
their presence as an indication 
that they had commenced life's 
journey on the right road—in 
the Sunday school and church. 
“It is from you boys and girls that 
the leading men and women of the 
future must come” he said. He 
urged them to make up their minds 
to be something, and do something. 
“No man” said he, “rises now-a - 
days , against his will , but by force 
of it. The men who reach the top 
get there after a fierce struggle; 
a srtuggle from within and without” 

The Risen Christ. 

The Risen Christ was the subject 
from which Dr. Hill preached a 
masterly sermon. Every seat in 
the auditorium was occupied. 

Although Mount Zion Sunday 
Schoolcontains scores of very small 
children, the editor does not re¬ 
member when he has spoken to 
a gathering of the kind, that took 
more interest in what he said than 
did the members of that school. 

From all of the churches comes 
the report of full houses and splen¬ 
did exercises. With our pulpits 
filled with broad-minded, capable, 
Christian men, it is simply won¬ 
derful what our churches can do 
in the work of uplifting the Negroes. 
The preacher's opportunities to 
do good are unlimited. 

CITIZEN'S MASS MEETING 


There will be a mass meeting 
of citizens at New Hope Baptist 
Church—Paloma Street, between 
16th and 17th, Friday evening, 
April 19th, 1912, at' 7:30 p. m.,

THREE 


CITY CLERK HANDLEY AND 
REV. DANA BARTLETT AD¬ 
DRESS THE LYCEUM 

In spite of numerous attractions 
last Sunday, a representative audi¬ 
ence turned out to the Lyceum, 
to hear the addresses of Rev. Dana 
Bartlett and City Clerk L. A. 
Handley. Mr. Handley’s address 
added greatly to his popularity 
among the colored people. In an 
able, forceful manner he discussed 
many of the issues confronting 
the people, urging his hearers to 
study them, as becomes good citi¬ 
zens. 

Rev. Dana Bartlett told of his 
work in the slums, extending 
through many years. In spite of 
his life spent among the lowly 
with poverty, squalor and suffer¬ 
ing for every day companions, 
he is the personification of optimism. 
His discussion of the cause and cure 
of the present day ills, accompanied 
by apt and striking illustrations, 
carried his argument home with 
telling effect. With unanimity, 
the members of the audience ex¬ 
pressed themselves as being men¬ 
tally richer and broader by having 
heard those addresses. 

Using the great Mississippi 
river as a type of our social life, 
Mr. Handley impressed upon his 
hearers as he could in no other 
way, the futility of attempting 
to elevate one class of society 
while neglecting the other. He 
said: “The Mississippi, above its 
junction with Missouri river, is 
clear. At the junction of those 
two rivers the clear water keeps 
to the left with the muddy, silt¬ 
bearing waters of the Missouri 
rolling on to the right, traveling many 
miles side by side. But, by con¬ 
tinual mixing, the muddy water 
gets the best of the contest and the 
great river becomes a mighty vol¬ 
ume of rolling, muddy water de¬ 
positing the silt at its mouth to 
the detriment of commerce. Each 
individual being a unit of society 
the stability of social purity de¬ 
pends upon the purity of its units. 

So every effort made to elevate 
the lowly is so much done for the 
protection of the high. 

Miss Pearl Lowry sang a solo. 


$16.00 was raised for the Day Nur¬ 
sery. In a few well chosen words 
Mrs. Eugene Walker, the presi¬ 
dent, thanked the audience for 
the donation.

gathered, that the program did 
not begin until 9:30, the hour when 
it should have closed. Many 
people who would have remained 
and enjoyed the refreshments and

TAFT DOOMED 


The Roosevelt victory in Illi¬ 
nois fixes the doom of president 
Taft, The Negro vote evidently 
went to Roosevelt, as the colored 
voters will lose no opportunity 
to strike down the author of that 
“Southern Negro policy.” Mr. 
Taft cannot get the Negro vote 
of New York, Illinois, Indianna, 
Ohio, Maryland or Massachusetts, 
if he should get the nomination. 
A new Negro—a Negro that thinks, 
has come upon the stage; and will 
have to be reckoned with as a man. 
The Negro Bureau, organized by 


Colonel Roosevelt to look after 
the Negro vote, is producing results. 

HON. THEODORE W. JONES 
WILL SPEAK 

Hon. Theodore W. Jones of Kan¬ 
sas, former comissioner of Cook 
county, Ill., will address the Ly¬ 
ceum next Sunday. Mr. Jones is 
a man of recognized ability and 
comes to us with a message that 
every one should hear. Every 
person who attends will gain much 
from the ripe experience of such 
men as the Hon. T. W. Jones. 
For the seeker after information 
few things are more helpful than 
lectures; and no people need lec¬ 
tures worse than do our people. 
The man who denies himself the 
benefits to be derived from lec¬ 
tures, simply dies of hunger in 
the midst of plenty. 


NEGRO VOTERS REMEMBERED 
Senator Cullom 

Some years ago Senator Cullom 
said, in discussing the so-called 
race problem, that if the Negroes 
were permanently disfranchised, 
the bulk of the Southern states 
would go into the Republican party. 
This suggestion was not only un¬ 
manly but criminal. Cullom was 
willing to destroy the results of 
the war and practically enslave 
ten millions of American citizens, 
if only the Republicans could secure 
permanent control of the country 
for the exploitation of trusts and 
soulless combines. One by one 
the traitors to liberty are falling. 


HANDWRITING ON THE WALL 
SUPERVISORS DOOMED 

The attempt of certain mem¬ 
bers of the Board of Supervisors 
to dodge behind the lady nurses 
in that nurse-training affair, is 
cowardly to say the least. * The 

feelings between the races were 

never better than they are now. 
Members of both races are pursuing 
their studies side by side in the 
public and private schools and 
colleges of this city and state. 

White people are employing 

thousands of Negroes in their 
homes, banks and stores. But 
in spite of this, and the rapid 


growth in the spirit of fair play, 
among all classes of our citizens 
this sneaking attempt is made to 
draw the color line in a public 
institution. The man who starts 
a row and then dodges 
behind a woman to protect him¬ 
self, is looked upon as being beyond 
the pale of manly consideration. 
To say that the lady nurses at the 
county hospital would leave the 
sick in that institution to suffer 
and die, if educated Negro girls 
were admitted there to learn how 
to properly nurse the sick is a gross 
slander upon the ladies mentioned. 

It is a slander upon the homes 
from which they came. 

We have many assurances from - 
white men of power and influence 
that they will aid the Negro voters 
at the polls in the election of men 
to office men that are ’broad-minded 
and are living in this age of progress; 
men who are too big to close the 
door of hope on the weak or any 
one else. In this fight your vote 
is all you need. 


MANY DEATHS 

The past ten days have marked 
the passing of many of our well 
known citizens. Mr. Frank Wil- 
kerson of 1376 W. 35th Place 
died Tuesday after a short illness. 
His funeral, which was held at 
Wesley Chapel, was attended by 
nearly a thousand persons. Revs. 
Kenchin and Gordon conducted 

the services. -

FITE 


Booker T. Washington Art Club 
was entertained Thursday, March 
28, at the residence of Mrs. Wm. 
Ellis of 1454 West 35th Place 
in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Wash¬ 
ington Reed. Light refreshments 
of sandwiches, cocoa, ice cream and 
cake, candies and fruits were served. 
All reported a delightful time. 
Mr. and Mrs. Reed departed for 
their home in St. Louis, Mo., 
Sunday, March 31. 


Easter Services at the Eighth 
Street Christian Church, Easter 
morning, were both beautiful and 
impressive. The choir rendered 
some beautiful songs. 

The program consisted of reci¬ 
tations, select readings and vocal 
solos. 

The most beautiful and impres¬ 
sive part of the service was an 
Easter token in the form of an 
individual communion set, present¬ 
ed to the church by Mrs. M. A. 
Toney of 1571 West 36th Place, 
and Mrs. Richardson of 35th and 
Raymond Avenue. 


The Booker T. Washington Art 
Club held the election of officers 
Thursday, April 4th, at the resi¬ 
dence of Mrs. Mamie Lewis, 1236 1-2 
Hobart Blvd. 

The officers elected are as fol¬ 


lows: Mrs. Frank Ross, president; 
Mrs. J. W. Payne, Vice-President; 
Mrs. Albert Wise, corresponding 
secretary; Mrs. Ernest Clements, 
financial secretary; Mrs. N. W. 
Cobb, treasurer. After the elec¬ 
tion of officers was completed, Mrs. 
Lewis served turkey, cranberry 
sauce, turkey dressing, celery and 
coffee. 


FOOL’S PARADISE ON A STILL 
HUNT FOR FREE GROCER¬ 
IES 


Since the Fool's Paradise (For¬ 
um) hoodwinked a couple of law¬ 
yers out of a big legal opinion 
free, it has been on a still hunt for 
some other business to smash. 
Recently its “limber-jaws" engaged 
in a gabfest as to the best method 
of running the groceries of the 
country. To hear those chin-mer¬ 
chants who never trade with Ne¬ 
groes if they can help it, tell how 
to handle groceries by the mil¬ 
lions, makes Jevne and Cohn look 
silly. Although these fellows tell 
how to make millions by selling 
groceries, they couldn’t success¬ 
fully run a chitlin counter. And, 
although unable to employ them¬ 
selves, they are experts in the bank¬ 


ing and mercantile pursuits. Al¬ 
though they never visit a Negro 
grocery, they lectured to Negro 
grocers telling them why their 
business was .so small and how to 
run grocery stores so as to make 
“pots full of money and furnish 
employment for us and our chil¬ 
dren," as one of them put it. 
Finally, one fellow in the rear of 
the hall, said something about 
advertising in the Negro papers; 
like a flash, one fellow scrambled 
to his feet and shouted: “Let 
Negro papers alone, and sell your 
groceries cheaper than white 
grocers do. 

How the Negro who pays the 
same prices for his groceries that 
white men pay can under-sell them 
and keep out of jail or the poor 
house is puzzling to any one not 
a member of the Fool’s Paradise. 
This suggestion is doubtless a 
knock at Negro grocers—a cunning 
attempt to keep Negro trade away 
from them by requesting them to 
do the impossible. To hear Ne¬ 
groes who have never made any¬ 
thing but a noise, tell other folks 
just how to make money is some¬ 
times amusing. The F. P. can 
humbug some colored lawyers of 
legal opinions, but they will never 
fill their stomach with free grocer¬ 
ies from a Negro grocery.
