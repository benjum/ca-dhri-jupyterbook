THE LIBERTY DYE WORKS 

A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THAT LENDS ENCOURAGEMENT 


One of the most creditable en¬ 
terprises conducted by Negroes 
in this city is the Liberty Dye 
Works, 1420 South Main Street. 
Commencing, a few years ago, as 
the agent for one of the laundries, 
Mr. O. S. Fletcher, proprietor of 
the Liberty Dye Works, made 
a study of the cleaning and dyeing 
department of the laundry for 
which he worked. After saving 
up money enough to purchase a 
horse and wagon, he went into 
business for himself. He now em¬ 
ploys 14 persons with a pay roll 
of $100 per week. He runs three 
wagons and two auto cars. The 
auto cars cost $1908. His washing 
machine said by the laundry men 
to be one of the finest in the city, 
cost $265. His extractor for dry¬ 
ing clothes cost $185 and clothes 
placed in this extractor are dried 
in three minutes. The motive 
power of the plant is furnished by 
a three horse power electric motor. 
In the show cases of the Liberty 
Dye Works are some of the finest 
fabrics and wearing apparel of 
every description. An investiga¬ 
tion will convince any one of the 
ability of the Liberty Dye Works 
to expertly handle any work in¬ 
trusted to their care. 

Mr. Fletcher's new plant on 
Central Avenue, will be completed 
July 1st. In this new plant, owned 
by Mr. Fletcher, will be installed 
four washing, machines and one 
self presser; the presser alone to 
cost $290. This plant to be in 
every way modern will have a 
capacity for the employment of 
30 persons. If this company gets 
the patronage of the race that it 
deserves it will easily furnish em¬ 


ployment in a short time for a 
hundred of our young people. 

We have a number of colored 
firms in the city who have dyeing 
and cleaning done in whole sale 
lots who can safely intrust their 
work to the Liberty people, who 
will not only give them as good 
prices as they can get elseAvhere 
but will guarantee satisfaction in 
every particular. 

Our ministers could render the 
race no greater material service 
than that of visiting this plant, 
convince themselves of its impor¬ 
tance as a coming race enterprise 
and encourage the members of 
their several congregations to pat¬ 
ronize it. In this way they could 
aid in furnishing profitable employ¬ 
ment for many of their young 
church people. 

Mr. Fletcher or any employee 
of the firm will take pleasure in 
showing visitors through that 
splendid establishment. 


UMPQUA VALLEY INVESTORS 
HAPPY 


About 30 of the bond holders of 
the Harding Umpqua Valley or¬ 
chards met at the chapel of the 
A. J. Roberts Sons Co., to hear 
the report of their agent Mr. A.

chards in the Umpqua Valley in

CALL FOR CONFERENCE EN- * 
HORSED * 

Editor The Liberator * 

Mv Dear Sir:— * 

I fully agree with your sugges- * 
tions for a race conference. By * 
all means let us have a conference * 
at an early date. So far as race * 
interest is concerned, things are * 
going from bad to worse and unless * 
there is a getting together for the 
protection of our common rights, 
we will soon have nothing to pro¬ 
tect. Such a gathering could not 
only consider matters political, but 
could consider matters of business, 
looking to the encouragement of 
race enterprises. Our people should 
be encouraged to purchase acreage, 
engage in farming and become 
producers as well as consumers. 

I have been patronizing the 
public market for three years mak¬ 
ing three visits per week. During 
all that time I have not had the 
privilege of making a purchase 
from a colored person. This 
should not be so. Mr. Editor I 
am a regular reader of your able 
paper and fully appreciate the 
work you are doing for the race. 
Please accept my best wishes. 

I am yours sincerely 

R. W. COOK

235 IN LINE 


The Masonic parade, last Sun¬ 
day, was the largest and most 
brilliant secret society parade in 
the history of the city. 235 men 
in their brilliant uniforms furnished 
an attraction that will not soon 
be forgotten. 

Again Wesley Chapel’s beauti¬ 
ful auditorium was packed to its 
utmost capacity. Although the 
gentlemen made a splendid ap¬ 
pearance, the occasion would have 
been incomplete without the Ladies 
of the Household of Ruth, Rev. 
E. W. Kenchin preached an elo¬ 
quent and appropriate sermon. 
The Order presented the church 
with $40.00.

Ir. Ira Reid Warren, aged 30, 
husband of Mrs. Susie Edmonds 
Warren and son of Mr. and Mrs. 
I. B. Warren, departed this life 
Thursday, June 20th. He has been a 
member of the Methodist Epis¬ 
copal Church since boyhood. Be¬ 
sides a widow and two children 
and a daughter six months old, 
he leaves a mother, father, four 
brothers and a number of relatives. 

The funeral services, held at 
the Wesley M. E. Church, June 
22nd, conducted by Rev. E. W. 
Kenchin, were very impressive. 
The floral offerings were many 
and beautiful. Interment was 
made at Rosedale Cemetery. 

Requiescat in pace . 


MRS. C. W. HOLDEN PASSES 
TO HER REWARD 

Mrs. Laura Holden, loving wife 
of Caleb W. Holden, and devoted 
mother of Lula Adams, wife of 
Daniel H. Adams, and Gertrude 
Hunt, wife of J. E. Hunt, Caleb, 
Jr. and grandmother of Elizabeth 
Adams and Elmer Hunt Jr., was 
born in Providence, Louisiana, Jan. 
8th, 1862. At the age of fourteen 
she became converted and lived 
a pure, simple devoted Christian 
life—always hopeful, looking for¬ 
ward to the time when her work 
should be completed and she should 
be called from labor to reward. 

She was married in Galveston, 
Texas, Jan. 8th, 1879 to Caleb W. 
Holder; came to Los Angeles, June 
1888, where she has s i n c e 
resided, making many friends 
through her bright, cheerful disposi¬ 
tion; always uplifting, always ever 
ready to lighten the heavy burdened 
heart; became a member of Electa 


Chapter, O. E. S. in 1892; was 
elected as Royal Matron for four 
terms to the satisfaction of said 
order; was a truly loved and ever 
willing worker. Departed this life 
June 21, 1912. 

The funeral services, which took 
place at Wesley M. E. Church, were 
attended by an audience that more 
than filled the large auditorium. 
Rev. E. W. Kenchin, assisted by 
Rev. L. M. Hagood, preached the 
funeral sermon. Taking for their 
text the twenty-third Psalm. 
Both pastors spoke feelingly. The 
opening song was “Nearer My God 
To Thee,” and the choir singing 
“Shall We Gather At the River” 
as the casket was borne to the 
hearse. There were many beauti¬ 
ful floral offerings. Interment was 
made at Rosedale Cemetery. 

The board of trustees offered 
the following resolutions: 

Since God in his infinite mercy 
has called unto himself the beloved 
wife of Brother C. W. Holden, 
our President and co-laborer in 
the board of Trustees, 

Be it resolved, that we, the 
members of the board of Trustees 
of Wesley M. E. Church, convey 
to him and his family our most 
heartfelt sympathy in this his 
great loss. We shall ever hold 
kind recollections of her and we 
rejoice with you to know that for 
her this short day of checkered 
sunlight and shadow has given 
way to the long day of Eternity. 

Resolved, that a copy of these 
resolutions be forwarded to the 
family.

TROUBLES ALL SETTLED 


Pasadena, Cal. 

June 25, 1912. 

Metropolitan Church and its 
$1000 dollar Rally is much talked 
about in the city. 

The clouds of discord which 
hung over the moral and spiritual 
skies of the church have cleared 
away. No thunder to be heard 
and nothing but sunshine to be seen. 
Rev. R.D. Arline,B.D., who we found 
to be its much beloved and honored 
pastor is still declared the worthy 
shepherd of the flock. 

I, being one of serveral minis¬ 
ters who were called by the pastor 
and clerk of the church to sit in 
a council of which I was elected 
secretary, am prepared to state 
facts in the case. The council's 
investigation was ample, its care¬ 
ful decision is effectual and is 
remarkably told in peaceful results. 

We found that the pastor and 
congregation of the Metropolitan 
Baptist Church have almost com¬ 
pleted, on Waverly Drive, one of 
the most adequate, most beautiful 
and substantial church edifices 
built by any colored congregation 
in Southern California. In order 
to complete and go in same in the 
next month, they are in the midst 
of a big rally to come off 2nd Sun¬ 
day in July. 

The following sisters have been 
appointed solicitors in what they 
call ten Virgins: 


Madams E. L. Gains, A. S. Shep¬ 
herd, Caroline Lewis, E. S. Dotson 
Ada C. Williams, Florence Wing¬ 
field, Mattie Thompson, Eliza¬ 
beth Harris, Anna Harmon and 
Mary Towsel. 

The following sisters, O. V. Har¬ 
rison, Georgia Cane, R. C. Calmore 
Mary Edwards, C. E. McWilliams', 
constitute a 2nd division headed 
by the pastor. 

These workers are among the 
best and most influential of the 
churches in California. Each 
Captain or Virgin is expected to 
raise $100.00 A premium will be 
given for every one hundred dol¬ 
lars and a prize of $25.00 in gold 
to the one reporting the highest 
amount above $100.00. You can 
imagine how busy these workers 
are. 

One of ten or more services will 
be held Sunday, 3 p. m., at Y. M. 
C. A. Building, No. Meringo Ave/ 
Mrs. W. C. Williams one of the 
Virgins will take charge of the 
offering as this will be her service. 
She is looking for her friends to 
be present to help her out. 

Good many of the pastors of 
Los Angeles have promised to be 
present even with donations from 
their churches to help struggling 
Metropolitan out. Rev. F. W. 
Cooper of Riverside, Cal. and Rev! 
J. T. Hill will officiate.

THE LYCEUM 


The address Judge Forbes was 
to deliver at the Lyceum has been 
postponed to July 7th. 

Owing to the Masonic annual 
sermon, the audience at the Ly¬ 
ceum was small. In the midst 
of the program the Masons, re¬ 
turning from their annual sermon, 
were given possession of the Hall 
by request of temporary president 
Edmonds. 

* After the splendid looking men 
had filed in and taken their seats, 
Mr. G. W. Snell, chairman of the 
program committee arose and said: 
“Gentlemen, you have spoiled our 


meeting by taking our crowd away 
with you. Now we are your ten¬ 
ants, therefore, I call upon you 
for a liberal collection with which 
to pay you your rent.” 

This joke was greeted by con¬ 
siderable laughter after which they 
contributed $3.25 to the Lyceum. 

Owing to an oversight, the 
splendid meeting held at the Ly¬ 
ceum on the 16th, was not reported 
in our last issue. Presiding elder 
Howard of the A. M. E. Zion 
church delivered a splendid address 
which was followed by short ad¬ 
dresses by Rev. Byers, G. Walter 
Snell and Attorney Ceruti. 

Attorney Ceruti spoke of race 
ingratitude as shown by the fact 
that the Negroes have erected no 
monuments to the memory of 
their great men who did so much 
in their day for the advancement 
of the race. 

Unfortunately our people are 
not only forgetful of their historic 
dead, but are wanting in gratitude 
to their living heroes who are 
sacrificing everything that their 
opportunities inay be enlarged.

DECLARES A DIVIDEND 


The Angel City Investment Co. 
will declare a dividend of 4% 
August 1st, and from that date 
dividends will be declared quarterly. 
This is the first dividend ever 
declared by a Colored Investment 
Company which shows not only 
that the affairs of the Company 
are conducted in a business way 
but that Negro men and women 
are learning how to do business 
with each other. The fact that 
the company’s stock found hun¬ 
dreds of colored buyers shows that 
confidence in each other has taken 
on a healthy growth. Upon in¬ 
vestigation we find that the busi¬ 
ness of the Company is honestly 
and economically conducted. The 
Company is in every way worthy 
of the confidence that is being 
placed in it. 


MONROVIA AND VICINITY 


The AfroAmerican Congress held 
an important meeting in the A. 
M. E. Zion Church, Thursday 
the 20th. Mr. Wm. Holland is 
president. 


While in Monrovia last week, 
we made pleasant calls at the 
following homes: Mrs. M. J. Jack- 
son, who handles real estate and 
owns some choice property in 
Duarte; Mr. D. G. Graham, the 
only colored grocer in Monrovia; 
Mr. J. H. Bonner, a teaming con¬ 
tractor, who is always busy and 
has a lot of children and keeps all 
of them in school; Mrs. Guinn, a 
prominent worker in the A. M. E. 
Zion church; Mrs. Cuoton, another 
faithful worker in the church; 
Mrs. Kate Wright, a good Chris¬ 
tian woman who conducts a sani¬ 
tarium for the poor; and Miss 
Mamie Shaw, who is keeping house 
for her father and brothers and 
sisters. 

Mr. J. I. W. Fisher, the only 
colored blacksmith in Monrovia, 
is over-worked in spite of the fact 
that he runs two shops in the same 
town. He expects to take a vaca¬ 
tion in a few days. 


We met Mr. John H. Malone 
and learned for the first time of 
the loss of his son who was killed 
accidentally in a canyon near Mon¬ 
rovia. 


Mr. E. L. Adams has completed 
his beautiful new home on East 
Maple Avenue. 


Mrs. Wm. Burleson is visiting 
her daughter in Santa Barbara. 


DUARTE 

We visited the following homes 
in Duarte on the 20th: Mr. Wm. 
Wright, who runs a hog and poultry 
ranch; Mr. Wright has a number 
of children the most of whom are 
attending school; Mrs. S. L. Jones, 
who runs a nursery for colored 
children; Mr. Benjamin McClain, 
one of Duarte’s first colored resi¬ 
dents; Rev. I. E. Fetzer and Mrs. 
Wilson.

FITS 


Mrs. Henry Jones is in the city 
for a few days. 


Mr. J. F. Allen was in the city 
on the 20th. 


Miss Ethel Bluett left the High 
school on account of her eyes. 


The friends of Rev. T. B. Bynum, 
pastor of the A. M. E. Church of 
Duarte, will regret to learn of 
the serious illness of his wife. 


Mr. Prudon, Mr. Wm. Cuoton 
and Mr. John Williams are build¬ 
ing new homes in Duarte. 


Rev. E. W. Kenchin and Mr. 
John Rakestraw were in Duarte 
on the 20th. 


Mrs. Anna Hodge will return to 
Atlanta, Ga., to visit her mother 
and sister, after an abscence of 
seven years, on Thursday, the 
27th. Mrs. Hodge and her hus¬ 
band Wm. Hodge have lived in 
Duarte for the past three years 
where they own two acres of 
oranges in addition to a neat little 
home in the city. 

Last year the trustees of the 
Duarte school appointed Mrs. 


Hodge janitress of their beautiful 
new school building—a position 
that had never been filled satis¬ 
factorily. Mrs. Hodge performed 
her duties so creditably that there 
was not a single complaint made 
against her and she was re-appoint- 
ed without opposition. Her many 
friends wish her a pleasant visit. 


Mrs. Geo. Talbert, of Sacramento, 
is visiting her father and mother, 
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Easton, 1222 
Ivy Street. 


A BEAUTIFUL HOME WEDDING 


One of the happy June brides 
is Mrs. Lillie Banks who was 
married to Mr. Henry H. Banks 
on the 19th. Mrs. Banks was 
formerly Miss Lillie B. Elliot. 

It was a beautiful home wedding 
taking place at the home of the

were beautiful; the color scheme 
being pink and green. The bride 
and groom have the best wishes 
of a host of friends. 


Mrs. J. A. Fingers, who has 
been confined to her room for 
many weeks is up and about. This 
news is pleasing to her friends. 


Mrs. Fingers is one of the promi¬ 
nent workers in the New Hope

and other societies that are labor¬ 
ing for the social uplift of the 
people.
