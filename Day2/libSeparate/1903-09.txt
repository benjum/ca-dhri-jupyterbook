A GREAT SPEECH BY 
THE NATION’S CHIEF. 
A PATRIOTIC PLEA. 

Class Divisions Cannot be 
Tolorated. 

THE PRESIDENT’S LABOR DAY 
SPEECH. 

For scope, logic and depth of reason¬ 
ing, the President’s speech on Labor 
Day is by far the ablest of his recent 
productions. In fact, it is the ablest, 
broadest, most patriotic argument ever 
delivered before the American bar of 
public opinion. In spite of its brevity, 
wl**ch is one of its beauties, he touches 
every phase of our national life, point¬ 
ing out the national sins that lead to 
national death. He traces the downfall 
of the great republics of antiquity to 
class division, , then class legislation. 
For want of space we can give only a 
few extracts from his great speech. He 
strikes the keynote as follows: 

“It is all-essential to the continuance 
of our healthy national life that we 
should recognize this community of in¬ 
terest among our people. The welfare 
of each of us. is dependent fundamen¬ 
tally upon the welfare of all of us, and 
therefore in public life that man is the 
best representative of each of ns who 
seeks to do goed to each by doing good 
to all; in other words, whose endeavor 
it is not to represent any special class 
and promote merely that class’s selfish 
interests, but to represent all true and 
honest men of all sections and all classes 
and to work for their interests by work¬ 
ing for our common country. 

We can keep our government on a 


sane and healthy basis, we can make 
and keep our social system what it 
should be, only on condition of judging 
each man, not as a member of a class, 
but on his worth as a man.” 

Those who would make the color 
of the skin the test of citizenship or a 
man’s rights dependent upon his occu¬ 
pation, will do well to read the above 
and mend their ways. If this govern¬ 
ment is to exist in its present form, 
these advocates of class legislation have 
attempted the impossible. But in the 
following paragraph, he deals the Till¬ 
man gang and the wretched trouble 
breeders who preach the gospel of race 
hate a knock-out blow. The advocates 
of the color line as a test of man and 
womanhood, those who encourage mob 
law will find but cold comfort in the 
President's patriotic utterances. He 
uses a sword with edges pointing in 
every direction, and cutting wherever 
sin is found. 

THE INFAMOUS THING. 

“It is an infamous thing in our Amer¬ 
ican life, and fundamentally treacher¬ 
ous to our institutions to apply to any 
man any test save that of his personal 
worth, or to draw between two sets of 
men any distinction save the distinction 
-‘f conduct, the distinction that marks 
"iff those who do well and wisely from 
those who do ill and foolishly. There 
are good citizens and bad citizens in 
every class, as in every locality, and the 
attitude of decent people toward great 
public and social questions should be 
determined, not by the accidental ques¬ 
tions of employment or locality, but by 
those deep-set principles which repre¬ 
sent the innermost souls of man. 

“The failure in public and private life 
thus to treat each man- on his own 


merits, the recognition of this govern¬ 
ment as being either for the poor as 
such or for the rich as such, would 
prove fatal to our republic, as such 
failure and such recognition have al¬ 
ways proved fatal in the past to other 
republics. A healthy republican govern¬ 
ment must rest upon individuals, not 
upon classes or sections. As soon as 
it becomes government by a class or 
by a section, it departs from the old 
American ideal.” 

The above shows that our great pres¬ 
ident is ahead of his time, but his 
ideals will be reached or this republic 
will fall. 

WHY REPUBLICS FELL. 

“In the history of mankind, many re¬ 
publics have risen, have flour shed for 
a less or greater time, and £&n have 
fallen because their citizens lost the 
power of governing themselves and 
thereby of governing their state, and in 
no way has this loss of power been so 
often and so clearly shown as in the 
tendency to turn the government into a 
goverment primarily for the benefit of 
one class instead of a government for 
the benefit of the people as a whole. 

“Again and again, in the republics of 
ancient Greece, in those of mediaeval 
Italy and mediaeval Flanders, this ten¬ 
dency was shown, and wherever the ten¬ 
dency became a habit it invariably and 
inevitably proved fatal to the state. In 
the final result it mattered not one whit 
whether the movement was in favor of 
one class or of another. The movement 
was equally fatal, whether the country 
fell into the hands of a wealthy oligar¬ 
chy, which exploited the poor, or 
whether it fell under the domination of 
a turbulent mob, which plundered the 
rich. In both cases, there resulted vio¬ 
lent alternations between tyranny and 
disorder, and a final complete loss of lib¬ 
erty to all citizens—destruction in the 
end overtaking the class which had for

the moment been victorious as well as 
that which had momentarily been de¬ 
feated. The death knell of the repub¬ 
lic had rung as soon as the active power 
became lodged in the hands of those 
who sought, not to do justice to all 
citizens, rich and poor alike, but to 
stand for one special class and for its 
interests as opposed to the interests of 
others.” 

NO ROOM FOR IDLERS. 

“There is no room in our healthy 
American life for the mere idler, for 
the man or the woman whose object 
it is throughout life to shirk the du¬ 
ties which life ought to bring. Life 
can mean nothing worth meaning, un¬ 
less its prime aim is the doing of duty, 
the achievement of results worth achiev¬ 
ing. A recent writer has finely said: 
“After all, the saddest thing that can 
happen to a man is to carry no bur-, 
dens. To be bent under too great a | 
load is bad; to be crushed by it is lam¬ 
entable; but even in that there are pos* ( 
sibilities that are glorious. But to carry: 
no load at all—there is nothing in that. 
No one seems to arrive at any goal | 
really worth reaching in |his world I 
who does ^t come to it heavy laden.” 

“Surely.’-^fom our own experience, 
each of us knows that this is true. From 
the greatest to the smallest, happiness 
and usefulness are largely found in the 
same soul, and the joy of life is won 
in its deepest and truest sense only by 
those who have not shirked life’s bur¬ 
dens/’ 

TRIBUTE TO WOMAN. 

The man or woman who as bread¬ 
winner and home maker, or as wife 
and mother, has done all that he or she 
can do, patiently and uncomplainingly 
is to be honored, and is to be envied 
by all those who have never had the 
good fortune to feel the need and duty 
of doing such work. The woman who 
has borne, and who has reared as they 
should be reared, a family of children, 
has in the most emphatic manner de¬ 
served well of the republic. Her bur¬ 
den has been heavy, and she has been 
able to bear it worthily only by the 
possession of resolution, of good sense, 
of conscience, and of unselfishness. But 
if she has borne it well, then to her 
shall come the supreme blessing, for in 
the words of the oldest and greatest 
of books, “Her children shall rise up 
and call her blessed,” and among the 
benefactors of the land her place must 
be with those who have done the best 
and the hardest work, whether as law 
givers or as soldiers, whether in public 
or in private life.” 

ONE LAW FOR ALL. 

‘’There must be ever present in our 
minds the fundamental truth that in a 
republic such as ours the only safety 
is to stand neither for nor against any 
man because he is rich or because he is 
poor, because he is engaged in one oc¬ 
cupation or another, because he works 


with his brains or because he works 
with his hands. We must treat each man 
on his worth and merits as a man. We 
must see that each is given a square 
deal, because he is entitled to no more 
and should receive no less. Finally, 
we must keep ever in mind that a re¬ 
public such as ours can exist only in 
virtue of the orderly liberty which 
comes through the equal domination of 
the law over all men alike, and through 
its administration in such resolute and 
fearless fashion as shall teach all that 
no man is above it and no man below 
it. 


A YEAR OF PROGRESS 
AMONG THE COLORED 
BUSINESS MEN 


Eugene Walker, the tailor, is doing aj 
larger business than ever. His goodj 
are purchased from the best tailorin ^ 
establishments, in Chicago, which en 
ables him to cater to the leaders in 
fashionable dress. 


Mr. J. H. Jamison, the scrap iron 
broker, employs many men and does 
perhaps the larges' business done by 
any individual colored man in the city. 
In his beautiful home, 722 Metio street, 
will be found the largest and most com¬ 
plete library found in any colored 
home in the city. 


Living as we are in an age of com¬ 
mercialism. co-operation and combina¬ 
tion, the negro, to hold a place of any 
considerable importance among the men 
of affairs in his community, will have 
to be a p~rt of its wealth producing ele¬ 
ment. To be in complete harmony with 
the business men of his community and 
have their sympathy the negro must be 
one of them. If you would enjoy the 
confidence of the taxpayers, be one of I 
them. And so on through the whole | 
category of good citizenship. So well 
is this being understood by the negroes , 
that they are buying homes and beauti-. 
fying them and are not only engaging 
in business but are making healthy, solid 
progress as is shown by the increase 
in the amount of business, done by them 
in the past twelve months. 

THE GREAT WESTERN STOVE 
AND REPAIR COMPANY. 

This is not only the leading colored 
firm in the city but is the largest firm 
of the kind west of the .Rockies. Mr. 
G. B. Lewis, president of the firm, was 
an employe of the Cass and Smurr Stove 
Company three years ago. So prosper¬ 
ous has been the business of the firm 
their space has been more than doubled 
in the past 18 months. Their store. 
611 South Broadway, is a credit to that 
aristocratic thoroughfare. Mr. Lewis, 
as well as the business which he is 
so successfully managing, is an object 
lesson to those who may doubt the ne¬ 
gro’s capacity to do a successful busi¬ 
ness in this day of fierce 'competition* 
He is a full blooded African. 


Mr. J. B. Loving, the real estate man, 
is making a success in his line that is 
encouraging from every standpoint. To 
the colored people who want homes he 
is the most important man in the city. 
He has business, residence and acreage 
property that he sells or leases on terms 
to suit parties desiring them. The ne¬ 
gro is to a large extent relieved from 
the humiliation he frequently meets 
with in white real estate offices, by be¬ 
ing told that “No negroes are wanted." 
He builds houses on the installment 
plan. Office 228 North Main street. 
Miss Lettie Scott, his pretty office girl, 
says she cannot entertain young men 
unless they call to buy property. 


Mr. C. C. Flint, the grocer, 239 East 
Second street, is doing a thriving busi¬ 
ness carrying a complete up-to-date 
stock. In view of the spirited compe¬ 
tition in the grocery business and the 
close margin at which groceries are s*dd, 
Mr. Flint’s success is more than flat¬ 
tering and he deserves the support of 
the colored people in particular. Every 
negro that succeeds makes it easier for 
another one to succeed. 


B. W. Brown & Co., 672 San Fer¬ 
nando street, carry a large and well se¬ 
lected stock of crockery, glass and 
china-ware. They are the only colored 
firm in the city that is making a special¬ 
ty in this line. Their stock is three 
times as large as it was twelve months 
ago. The stock comprises everything 
carried in a first-class store and is dis¬ 
played in a manner that would do credit 
to any house in the city. 


C. H. Perry & Co., 220 East Second 
street, upholsterers and dealers in new 
and second-hand goods, are doing a 
creditable business and deserve the suc¬ 
cess they are meeting with. Mr. Perry 
makes a specialy of upholstering and is 
regularly employed. 


Professional men.—Isidor B. Blair, 
attorney-at-law, “the first black man to 
practice at the bar in this city,” is a 
graduate of the Ann Arbor, Mich., law 
sdhool, is a brilliant young man and 
comes well recommended by judges and 
lawyers who know him. He has already 
a good share of the colored peoples’ 
business. Hon. G. W. Wickliffe, the 
first member of the race to practice at 
the bar here, and who was an ornament 
to the race as well as the bar, was not 
a “black man,” but none possessed more 
race pride than he. He holds a posi¬ 
tion in the office of the harbor com¬ 
missioners *»t San Francisco and main¬ 
tains the high standing characteristic of 
him.

and Outlaw are well known for their

S 


skill and professional worth. They have 
each a good practice and are getting 
their share of the prevailing prosperity. 
In the medical profession they are rep¬ 
resentatives of whom the race is justly 
proud. 


Doctor Garrott, tht only colored den¬ 
tist in the city, has the field to himself. 
His work and exalted character has 
made him a general favorite. His of¬ 
fice in the Wilson block, corner Spring 
and First streets, is supplied with all 
modern apparatus used by the profes¬ 
sion. He can and does any work in 
dentistry. 


Capt. G. W. Hawkins, G. Cummings 
and J. H. Smith, dealers in new and sec¬ 
ond-hand furniture, stoves and hard¬ 
ware, are keeping pace with the times, 
each doing a prosperous business. Be¬ 
sides his store, Capt. Hawkins owns a 
valuable ranch near Long Beach, which 
itself is worth a fortune. Mr. Smith is 
the youngest man in the business, he 
full of pluck and bound to succeed. His 
place is on Third street, near Central 
avenue. 


Mr. J. August, 21 5 East Second street, 
dealer in gents' furnishing goods, car¬ 
ries a full assortment in his line, and in 
spite of his ill health for the year, his 
business has an upward tendency. 

Employment office—At 233 East Sec¬ 
ond street, Mr. W. H. Robinson con¬ 
ducts an employment office and, although 
he furnishes help daily, he finds it im¬ 
possible to supply the demand for col¬ 
ored help. He has places for fifty col¬ 
ored women at prices from $25 to $35 
per month. Those who want work will 
do well to call upon him. 


Mr. Robt. J. Boyd, proprietor of the 
Cosmopolitan Tonsorial Parlors, 242 
East Second street, has by first-class ser¬ 
vice and courteous employes made his 
place the headquarters for persons de¬ 
siring such service. His place is neat 
and complete. Pie carries a full line 
of cigars. Agent for laundry. 


white neighbors into putting up re¬ 
spectable buildings. His presence has 
not reduced the value of property itt his

NEW FIRMS. 

Messrs. C. C. Leake and E. Manning 
have rented the building, 124 San Pedro 
street, where they will open and con¬ 
duct a fruit and vegetable produce mar¬ 
ket. They are arranging to lease land, 
raise their own vegetables, giving their 
patrons fresh well-handled produce. This 
is a new departure on the part of the 
colored people and is bound to succeed. 


Messrs. H. C. Wheat and E. P. 
Eckles, Roocks and Crawford, painters, 
kalsominers, white washers and plas¬ 
terers, have established business at 104 
San Pedor street. 


ITEMS OF LOCAL INTEREST. 

The Men’s Forum seems to be on the 
decline. Having decided to do nothing 
but talk, it will go the way the old fel¬ 
low went who was talked to death. This 
is an age of deeds, not words. 


Mr. Richard B. Harrison, reader and 
entertainer, will read at the entertain¬

Cranston, Clinton and Salter are in. the 
city. Bishop Salter is returning from 
the annual conference recently held in 
San Francisco. The citizens tendered 
him a reception at the Stevne A. M. E. 
Church, which was largely attended. 
Bishop Clinton is on his way to the 
Oregon conference, which is soon to 
convene. He will be the guest of A. M. 
E. Zion Church and the citizens gener¬ 
ally for ten days. 


The negro should not let the oppor¬ 
tunity to buy lands pass. Lands worth 
$1000 per acre can be bought now for 
from $200 to $350 per acre. This will 
not last. The best place for the negro 
is on the farm, where he can make 
independent, self-supporting people of 
his children. 


MAKING AND DRESSING HATS 
—Mrs. Lawrence Stewart, of 1315 Chan- 
ning street, is prepared to make and 
dress hats in any style on short notice. 
Mrs. Stewart is a recent arrival from 
Natchez, Mississippi, and a former in¬ 
structor in the Alcorn, Miss., A, and 
M. college for colored youth® She 


guarantees satisfaction. 




The Jones Block. —Mr. A. J. Jones, 
the popular restaurant keeper, is putting 
a two-story brick block on his lot on 
San Pedro street. The lower stories are 
so constructed that two more stories 
may be added, making the block four sto¬ 
ries when complete. The cost of complet¬ 
ing the first two stories will be about 
$5500. Mr. Jones’ dining room, famous 
tin o^ghort the city for its excellent 
tables and his business made the block 
necessary. The block, which is the neat¬ 
est in its locality, will contain all mod- 
rn conveniences. Since he commenced 
he erection of his block all of the 
wooden shacks in the row have been 
raised preparatory to putting up brick 
structures. Mr. Jones not only leads 1 
the biscuit makers, but has led his 


The half negroes, who are always re¬ 
ferring: to the fact that they have white 
blood in their veins, ought to figure out 
how they got it. We have some in our 
veins, but we are ashamed of the way 
e came -by it. A father who allowed 
his own children to be reared and sold 
as slaves possessed few virtues of 
which they can boast. 


The Afro-American council or “Afro- 
American crambleT for spittoon jobs, 
which crambled four days at Pasadena 
last month and ended with a beer 
carousal at the beer joint known as the 
“Chutes,” will be fully described in our 
next. Now that bainful gang is begin¬ 
ning to cut each other's throat and marks 
the beginning of the end. Neimore, one 
of the gang’s true blues, was thrown 
down with a dull thud. By slaughter¬ 
ing Neimore they basely betrayed the 
Second Baptist clmrch, which stood by 
the push through thick and thin. 


The Grand Army encampment at San 
Francisco brought to this city many dis¬ 
tinguished colored visitors. Among 
them may be mentioned the names of 
Mrs. Mattie A. Bowen, principal 
of a training school for colored 
girls in Wasnington, D. C.; Hon. 
Charles R. Douglass, son of Hon. 
Frederick Douglass, the old man elo¬ 
quent; Judge M. W. Gibbs, of Little 
Rock. Ark.; Mr. W. H. Jefferson, wife 
and daughter of Vicksburg, Mississippi. 
Mr. Jefferson is an undertaker by trade 
and carries a $rs,ooo stock. Mr. and

of Natchez, Miss.; Mr. Brooks is a 
contractor and builder and owns con¬

It was our pleasure accompanied by 
Mrs. C. W. H. Nelson to show Mr. Jef¬ 
ferson, wife and daughter and Mr. and 
Mrs. Stewart of Indianapolis points of 
I interest around the city. The Cham¬ 
ber of Commerce made a splendid 
impression upon them. At the City 
Hall they met and were introduced to 
Mayor Snyder, spending a few pleasant 
moments in his office. Mr. Stewart is 
a North Carolinian, the same as the 
mayor. Their meeting was very cor¬ 
dial.

WHITE RAPE FIENDS STILL AT 
IT. 

In the past we have devoted what 
space we could spare to accounts of 
fiendish assaults upon white girls ot 
tender age by white brutes. The fact 
that there are five times as many as¬ 
saults by white men upon white fe¬ 
males as there by negroes to the million 
population shows that the crime of rape 
is peculiar to the white man. In spite 
of the fact that there are 300 fallen 
women in the red light district and hun¬ 
dreds and hundreds of them in the 
scores of assignation houses, rapes up¬ 
on while girls in this city and imme¬ 
diate neighborhood are of almost week¬ 
ly occurrence. The white people are so 
taken with the blacks, they seem to 
have completely lost sight of the white 
brute, who is claiming five times as 
many victims as the black brute. An¬ 
other feature of the rape business that 
lhas been overlooked is the fact that 
the black brute assaults white women 
and the white brue assaults white girls. 
How 'many of the women assaulted by 
the black brutes that were partners in 
their crimes is not known, and the num¬ 
ber of black brutes made so by paint 
is not known. 

LATE ADDITIONS TO THE RAPE LIST. 

At Colton, August 28th, an unknown 
white man assaulted the six-year-old 
daughter of a family named Kirk¬ 
patrick. 

Ed. Farwell was arrested in Orange 
August 29th for raping Ida Hawkins, 
aged 13. He is a married man, aged 
30. 

William Odell was lodged in jail at 
Anaheim for raping Myrtle Sackman, 
aged 12 years. 

Castration is urged for the cure of 
the black brute. It would be effective 
for any brute, whether of the higher 
or lower order. 


hind a door of hope, the door of hope 
would not be needed for the girls. 


THE TIMES. 

A recent editorial in “The Enter¬ 
prise,” touching the injustice done the 
negroes by the ignorant, ill-bred re¬ 
porters of the Times, who refer to ne¬ 
gro men as * coons” and respec/table 
negro women as “wenches,” was timely 
and to the point. It is well known that 
certain ;classes of ignorant, non-pro¬ 
gressive whites entertain, without cause, 
ill feeling toward the negroes, but how 
this class can get the use of a great 
paper like the. Times in which to vent 
their spleen is a mystery. This class of 
journalism cannot have the approval of 
General Otis. It is entirely out of har¬ 
mony with the noble service he is ren¬ 
dering humanity. . It is only the medium 
these ill-bred people use for their as¬ 
saults on character we notice, not them. 


MISS SUSIE EVA EDMONDS, 

proof-reader of Lhe Liberator, the first 
colored girl to enter the Times schol¬ 
arship contest, thereby making Miss 
Watson's victory possible, will, with 
Miss Watson, enter the University of 
Southern California September 21st. 
Miss Watson will enter the College of 
Liberal Arts and Miss Edmonds will 
take the Commercial Course. With Mr. 
C. W. Wilson, Wesley chapel will have 
three students in the University. Mr. 
Wilson, who has been a student at the 
University for two or more years, 
comes of a distinguished* family and 
shows signs of keeping up his family 
record. These young people have The 
Liberator’s best wishes. 


WAR ON THE “CRIBS.” 

Doctor Phillips, editor of the Cali¬ 
fornia Voice, backed by the moral sen¬ 
timent of the city, has opened war upon 
the redlight district. Balldffino, who 
owns a considerable part of this infa¬ 
mous district, was arraigned in the po¬ 
lice court on the 12th. He derives an 
enormous income from this traffic in 
white girls and is expected to make a 
hard fight. He is charged with renting 
one of the “cribs” to his own daughter. 
The Record says that there are 3C0 un¬ 
fortunate white girls in this district who 
earn $3000 per night. What a picture! 
What a state of moral depravity in a 
Christian city! To our mind the most 
serious question that presents itself to 
the reformer is, what is to be done with 
the 3000 libertines who patronize the 
district. Fully 25CO of these moral 
lepers are voters and occupy every sta¬ 
tion in life from the lousy tramp to the 
well dressed young man of leisure. The 
latter class carried these unfortunates 
there. If these men could be placed be¬ 


SPEEDY TRIAL FOR COL. GRIF¬ 
FITH. 

There are newspaper men and judges 
who advocate speedy trials and immedi¬ 
ate punishment for persons charged 
with henious crimes such as rape, or 
attempted rape, and murder. I'll is is 
urged as a remedy for the cure of mob 
violence. In other words, if a man 
is charged with the atempt, or the com¬ 
mission of the crimes above referred 
to, these advocates would have him 
placed on trial as soon as apprehended 
and convicted ancl hanged the same 
day if possible. These persons fail to 
discover that there .is no difference be¬ 
tween what they advocate and what 
the mob does. 

Col. Griffith, one of the most prom¬ 
inent public spirited citizens in the 
city, is charged with a deliberate at¬ 
tempt to murder his wife in cold blood. 
Now. if given the speedy trial that these 
people advocate, he would have been 
tried, convicted, sentenced and serving 
time in the states prison or some other 
place before this. In the case of Col. 
Griffith such proceeding would be a vio¬ 
lation of his constitutional right to *• 
fair and impartial trial which would 
not be tolerated for a moment. Wlint 
is true in this case should be true in 
every case regardless of race, color or 
condition. The more serious the of¬ 
fense, the greater the reason for calm 
deliberation in the trial of the accused. 
Tt is not the speed, but the ccrtaintv • 
Frnl punishment llrn serves as tlic be c t 
deterrent for the criminal closes. Col¬ 
ored men charged with henious crimes 1 
are frequently UWl, convicted and exe¬ 
cuted in rorrs after being accused.] 
Such executions are simply judicial 
murders. 

The charge against the Colonel is, a 
serious one and is sincerely deplored by 
all good citizens. 




















THE LI L»E RATOS..

MR. A. D. BILLUPS. 

Mr. Billups, former door man of the 
Angelus Hotel, is now with the James 
Smith Clothing Company, where he 
wants his friends to come when they 
want new clothing. Mr. Billups has 
been a resident of the city a year and 
by his gentlemanly deportment has made 
many friends. In the Vada Watson 
contest for a Times scholarship, which 
she won, he did sp’endid service. He 
sold $35 worth of tickets and won the 
second prize—a yearly subscription to 
that paper. 


71, the first ticket on the winning 
list, is held by Miss Vada Watson, en- 
titlting her to a year’s subscription to 
the Times. She wins a Times scholar¬ 
ship and the Times also. That’s luck 


THE- LADIES OF THE WESLEY 
CHAPEL M. E. CHURCH 
Under the leadership of Mrs. M. J. 
Sellers, will give four days and nights 
fair at the church, commencing October 
4th. They hope to raise $icco to begin 
work on the new church. We are proud 
of this church, its pastor and members 
because they are worthy people. Rev. 
Bryant is a sincere, earnest worker for 
good and the whole church loves him. 
The membership has almost doubled 
since he took charge, eight months ago. 
His salary and all of the conference 
claims have been paid and a surplus left 
011 hand. We hope our friends will turn 
out and help the ladies make the fair 
a success. 


VADA WATSON BENEFIT. 

The holders of tickets numbered 71, 
79, 124, 238, 242. 373, 376, 4°^ 448, 466, 
597, 629. 683, 810, 888, and 801 at the 
Vada Watson benefit concert during the 
late Times scholarship contest, will 


please present them at the office of 
C. C. Flint, No. 239 East Second street, 
for approval. Each of these tickets, 
when properly certified, will entitle the 
holder to one year’s subscription to the 
Daily Times. The proceeds of the con¬ 
cert were used in helping Miss Watson 
to win a scholarship in the University 
of Southern California. She got the 
scholarship, and will register as a stu¬ 
dent at the opening of the fall term 
next Monday. 


(Sunday’s Richmond Times-Dispatcb.) 

‘There are thousands of conserva¬ 
tives in. the Republican party, and they 
claim, with a great show r of reason, that 
the extremists of the South are very 
unjust to the Negro. Tillman, Money 
and Vardeman declare that the Negro 
has made no progress since his eman¬ 
cipation, and that he is constitutionally 
incapable of qualifying himself for cit¬ 
izenship. In reply to this, the conser¬ 
vative Republican presents an array of 
very stubborn and impressive facts. 
He says that for two hundred and fifty 
years Southern. Negroes were held as 
slaves, bought and sold as cattle are, 
and were destitute of almost every op¬ 
portunity for intellectual and moral im¬ 
provement. Since their emancipation 
they have made great progress. When 
they were set free they did not own a 
foot of land nor a roof to cover their 
heads. Fotty years later they had 130,- 
cco farms, valued at $350,000,000; 150,- 
cco homes, valued at $365,000,000. and 
personal property to the value of $165,- 
ooo,coo. Thus, in spite of their inexpe¬ 
rience in saving, they have accumulated 
nearly $900,000,000 of property.” 

“In 1863 not one per cent of the col¬ 
ored adults of the South could read; to¬ 
day forty per cent of them can read 
—d write; fifty per cent of their chil- 
*-en of school age are atending school; 
t 1 ere are 800 colored physicians prac¬ 
ticing medicine; more than 300 colored 
men are practicing law; 30,000 colored 
men and women are school teachers; 
in the homes of colored people in the 
South there are three hundred thousand 
books; they publish 450 newspapers and 
five magazines, and have published more 
than a" thousand books. Their desire 
for knowledge is not surpassed by the 
white people.” 


COLQ'R LINE DRAWN IN SODOM. 

Some time ago a negro named Brad¬ 
ley w°s arrested, charged with murder- 
in 0 * an unfortunate French woman in the 
red light district, but was discharged 
after investigation. Bradley’s arrest 
only served to give the white “mac” 
who committed the crime a chance to 
make his escape. The police depart¬ 
ment which is guardian of this district 
ordered the inmates to draw the color 
line, thus giving weak immoral negroes, 
if such there be, who patronize the hell¬ 
ish place, better protection than that 


given the erring white man. If a sim¬ 
ilar line could be drawn- against the 
young white men of the city many a. 
white mother would rise up and call 
the department blessed. 

Very often the color of the negro’s 
skin comes to his rescue. While we are 
opposed to drawing color line on. gen¬ 
eral principles, we have no objection to 
the police drawing it in 'Sodom and 
Gomorrah to the extent of keeping the 
negro out. The man who builds a 
fence between the negro and sin does 
the negro a favor whether he intends 
it or not. The white men own that dis¬ 
trict and everything in it, it’s their fight, 
we therefore advise the negro to stand 
way back and look on.

Rape fiends and lynchers are enemies 
of society in general and females in par- 
ticular, the law should exterminate both. 
The fiend who commits a rape should 
be hanged dead by his neck, but the law 
should do it regardless of race, color 
or condition. The fact white men who 
commit rapes upon colored girls are 
never hanged and seldom punished is a 
disgrace. The scoundrel that will rape 
a colored srirl will rape a white girl. It 
all rape fiends were tried by colored 
juries not one of them would escape 
conviction.
