We are hopeful from the fact 
that the people of the United States 
esteem most, the men that have 
stood and stand for the cause of 
human rights—and that they be 
shared by each and every citizen, 
without regard to creed or color. 

Does the Progressive Party 
stand for such an issue? 


NEGROES INTERVIEW WOOD- 
ROW WILSON. PROMISES 
TO GIVE NEGROES A SQUARE 
DEAL. 

Several delegations of colored 
men have waited on Governor 
Wilson, the Democratic nominee 
for President. The first delega¬ 
tion reports the result of their in¬ 
terview as follows: “Mr. Wilson 
assured, us first of all, that if elected, 
he intended to be a President of 
the whole nation—to know no 
white or black, no North, South, 
East or West, and no home-born 
or foreign-born, but that he would 
treat every citizen according to the 
laww—not only the letter, but 
according to the spirit of the law— 
and that he would discharge his 
obligations, his duties of office, 
in the spirit of Christ, and with 
justice and fairness to all. In the 
second place, even if the Presi¬ 
dent and both houses of Congress 
should be Democratic, he did not 
believe that any measures inimi¬ 
cal to colored people would be 
passed. He said that it was the 
understanding with the party 
leaders that this should be the 
case, but if by any accident such 
a measure or measures should be 
passed he would veto them. In 
the third place, he gave us to un¬ 
derstand that so far as patronage 
was concerned he could assure 
us that the colored people would 
fare as well under his administra¬ 
tion as President as they had fared 
under Republican administrations. 
In the fourth place, he promised as 
soon after his formal notification 
as possible he would get out a 
statement over his own name to 
the entire country refuting the 
falsehoods which are being so in- 
discriminatingly circulated against 


him by most of the colored news¬ 
papers and by many of the white 
papers and magazines of the coun¬ 
try relative to his emnity to and 
hatred of the colored man. We 
called the governor’s attention to 
the fact that it had already been 
repeatedly stated that if he became 
President he would use his power 
to spread 'Jim Crow’ and disfran¬ 
chisement acts against the colored 
man and to abolish the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments. He 
said that these were false state¬ 
ments; that he had no intention 
of doing any such thing and would 
frown upon the efforts of any who 
undertook to promote such acts. 
In short, he expressed himself as 
feeling the need of and desiring 
the colored vote and stated that 
he was willing to do anything that 
was right and legal to secure that 
vote, and that if elected President 
of the United States the colored 
people would have no occasion to 
regret having voted for him.”

MR. H. A. REAVES 


One of the successful and exem¬ 
plary young men of the city is 
Mr. H. A. Reaves. He came here 
8 years ago without money and 
entered the junk business as little 
capital was required. He now has 
three teams and employees a dozen 
men. He purchased a house and 
lot at 1429 Santa Fe Avenue for 
$3,500. He has since had the 
house lifted up putting beneath 
it a $1500 building, 70 by 38 feet. 
The front of which will be used for 
a restaurant, the rear being used 
as a head quarters for his junk 
business. A first-class restaurant 
will be opened there in a few weeks. 
There are hundreds of openings 
of various kinds in the city that 
await the coming of young men of 
the Reaves stripe. Instead of 
seeking employment of others 
where he could get ready money 
to be spent each night he created 
for himself a permanent job at 
the same time creating jobs for 
12 other members of his race.

THE HALL JUBILEE SINGERS 
ENTERTAIN BIG CROWD 


The crowd which turned out on 
the 11th to hear the Hall Jubilee 
Singers filled the main auditorium 
and partly filling the gallery. As 
an entertainment it will be hard 
to beat, the audience w T as held 
spell bound from start to finish. 
There was just enough humor 
interspersed in the programme to 
relieve the pathetic fervor that 
from time to time swept the entire 
audience. 

There were a few of us present 
who had heard those plantation 
melodies sung by the originals 
not for entertainment but in a 
serious vein, telling the story of 
an oppressed people whose hope 
for freedom was not expected to 
be realized till they crossed Times 
border. But those Jubilee singers 
put so much of their souls into 
their songs that we who heard those 
songs in other days were wafted 
back into the past and lived again 
with the men and women, who out 
of the fulness of their hearts sent 
those songs as living petitions to 
the throne of grace. One of the 
sweetest and most spiritual singers 
of the group was Mrs. Brooks. 
She and Manager Hall are a troupe 
by themselves. Every member of 
the troupe, however, did excel¬ 
lent work. 

If Mr. Hall is properly supported 
by the church he will have no 
trouble in raising $5000 dollars 
or more for the benefit of its in¬ 
debtedness. In getting up this 
concert Mr. Hall had everything 
to do himself, whereas the adver¬ 
tising and other arrangements 
should be made by some suitable 
person leaving Mr. Hall to care 
for the singing and stage manage¬ 
ment. For this last effort he 
deserves the thanks of the entire 
congregation.

Z. W. MITCHELL IN SALT LAKE 
CITY 


Mr. Z. W. Mitchell the self- 
styled Panama Commissioner is 
in Salt Lake City. On his visit 
to this city some time ago he was 
received by certain leaders with 
open arms as they usually do 
every stranger that drops in our 
midst. One of the local papers 
rushed to the front with an 
elaborate write up and big cut in 
its columns. In this way it did 
what it could to put Mitchell in 
the confidence of the people, with 
absolutely no previous knowledge 


of the man or his schemes. We 
knew at the time that the man was 
a faker and that the people were 
being deceived by the newspaper 
in question and the other gentle¬ 
men who were advertising him. 
But we have been so often criti¬ 
cized for exposing Negro fakers 
and traitors that we decided to 
let that faker expose the men he 
was using. 

When advertised to speak at 
the Y. M. C. A. we availed our¬ 
self of the opportunity to hear him 
and get a line on his scheme. 
When we heard him state before 
the Y. M. C. A. audience that he 
he had been appointed by the State 
board of Panama Commissioners 
as colored commissioner to look 
after the entertainment of colored 
people, to see that they enjoyed 
all the advantages to be accorded 
to others, we knew at once that he 
was the rankest sort of a faker. 
For we were in a position to know 
that no colored man had been 
appointed to such a position by 
the State board of Panama Com- 
misioners. On hearing this state¬ 
ment we got disgusted, took our 
hat and left. This faker made 
one of our local editors a deputy 
local commissioner; this incident 
alone has been the laugh of the 
town. Another note worthy inci¬ 
dent in this connection, is that Mit¬ 
chell like the other fakers who 
come to town used only college 
men to promote his schemes. It 
appears that colored men who 
haven’t been to college are too 
dull to be used in promoting the 
fake schemes of every rascally 
stranger that breaks into the city. 
The Western Outlook has the 
following to say: 

‘YVe published a card in these 
columns sent out by the Oakland 
Chamber of Commerce warning 
the public to beware of Z. W. 
Mitchell and his schemes. Polished 
suave and of pleasing address, he 
is a dangerous man, and his acts 
work harm to the race. There 
are those who have h-ad dealings 
with him and who know his crooked 
methods and they should speak 
out. We have a business men’s 
league which we believe is doing 


good, but we believe it can do more 
and should investigate the members 
of our race who essay business 
here, and if they are crooked the 
public should be warned. The 
papers would render whatever as¬ 
sistance they could, and when they 
spoke upon the authority of the 
league much of the personal ele¬ 
ment which the average reader 
is so ready to look upon as a knock 
would disappear and the public 
would he better satisfied. Let our 
business men’s league digest this 
thought and strengthen their spinal 
columns.” 

You are right, brother, yours is 
the only logical position to take in 
such matters. If a newspaper can¬ 
not defend the rights of its consti¬ 
tuents and protect the community 
at large by exposing crooks and 
fakers it is not worth supporting. 
The Liberator never loses an op¬ 
portunity if it can help it, to ex¬ 
pose crooks who attempt to beat 
the people. It also criticizes the 
public utterances of good men if 
these utterances are likely to create 
a sentiment unfavorable to the 
well-being of the community, es¬ 
pecially the Negro. 

This policy The Liberator will 
rigidly pursue in the future as it 
has in the past. 

From time to time we hear a 
good deal about u The Liberator 
exposing the race.” If warning 
the people to steer clear of Negro 
crooks and scoundrels is “exposing 
the race,” we are going to keep 
it up vigorously to the end of the 
chapter. Men who cannot stand 
criticism are either dishonest or 
do not possess the intelligence that 
leadership requires. 


COL. ROOSEVELT VEXED 


When the address delivered to 
CoL Roosevelt by Atty. Wickliffe 
was read to the colored committee 
previous to meeting the colonel it 
met the instant approval of more 
than three-fourths of the committee. 
Some thinking that it did not go 
far enough, others urged the chang¬ 
ing of a word or two. 

Rev. J. D. Gordon requested the 
privilege of putting the following 






























THE LIBERATOR 


m* 


question to Col. Roosevelt: "Have 
you changed your attitude towards 
the colored people?” 

The question was at once dis¬ 
approved by the committee on 
the premises that the entire ground 
had been covered in a states-man¬ 
like manner by the address. It 
was then decided that the address 
be delivered to Co.l Roosevelt 
as read without any changes. 

At the close of Col. Roosevelt’s 
talk, Rev. Gordon, contrary to 
the agreement stepped up and said: 

"Col. I want to ask you a ques¬ 
tion.” 

"Alright,” said the Colonel. 

"Have you changed your atti¬ 
tude towards the colored people?” 

At such a question the Colonel 
was evidently * irritated, and 
stated that that question had been 
frequently put to him and that 
it always vexed him. 

It was for that very reason that 
the committee opposed the putting 
of that question. The question 
was meaningless and could only 
put the committee in a thoughtless 
attitude. The only way to know 
of a public man’s attitude toward 
any public or other question is to 
note his acts and sayings on that 
question. Mr. Roosevelt’s atti¬ 


tude towards the Negroes is well 
known to everybody who reads.
